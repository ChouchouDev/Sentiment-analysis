I'm a college student I play sports and like to go out there with my girlfriend doing outdoor activities. This camera can do it all! The extra items that comes with the deal are simply helpful for the performance and affordable for a college student. I don't want to spend thousands of dollars on those big bulky DSLRs when I can have the same capabilities with Sony NEX 5r. I even got the Flash which cost about $100+ free from the deal. I SAVED a lot and really satisfied.", "Date": "July 18, 2013"}, {"Title": "Great Choice", "Author": "cecilia", "ReviewID": "R38HWP3E1339JA", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "That's exactly what I want, a light and somewhat professional camera.

Other places I checked they would sell the camera body for about $500 dollar alone, without the lens so this deal was incredible and I am so glad I found it.", "Date": "October 26, 2013"}, {"Title": "Great build quality", "Author": "Xavier H.", "ReviewID": "R2CPEF6LH182EQ", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I bought this camera for a friend, so I don't have used it very much, but I can tell that the build quality is great, the design is very comfortable to handle and the picture quality is great. It is a little more expensive than other models and brands, but the features and specifications well worth it. In terms of portability I prefer smaller models like Nikon 1 J2 o J3 series, but they also have minor specifications and features, so you can choose one or other according to use you're planning to do. The bundle is a great choice and is a real saving that worth to have. In resume, it is a great choice if it is on your budget.", "Date": "October 22, 2013"}, {"Title": "Excellent compact camera", "Author": "Trini LuvyT", "ReviewID": "R20RFN2NS3OLN2", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "I have very recently entered the realm of amateur/hobbyist photography and I am loving every chance I get to snap off a few shots! I haven't mastered the photog speak and as such I won't attempt it but will give you the basics of my experience thus far.As a mom, I have been able to capture stunning indoor night-time picture of my kids and nieces and nephews. The clarity of the pics were exceptional when compared to the bridge camera I got for Mothers' Day this year. With little to no effort and without having to use the auto setting, I can achieve great focus and lovely \"bokeh\" (oh oh, photog speak :)Focusing has been really quick and the intelligent auto has been giving me some impressive results. I have been using 3 different lenses...the kit lens (18-55mm), Sigma 30mm f 2.8 and Sony 16mm pancake. The clarity of the Sigma lens has been an eye opener.The LiveView display is a really helpful tool for beginners like me who are still trying to come to terms with the f-stops and shutter speeds. Once you adjust either or the exposure, you can see on screen instantly how the final photo will render! I particularly like this feature. I miss having an EVF however, and purchasing this as an accessory is not that crucial for me right now. I would rather spend that money on a macro lens!The menu and controls DO take some getting used to but I found that this camera makes you want to dig into it to discover all that its capable of! Read the manual or even the Sony NEX 6/5r manual by Gary Friedman...you'll be well on your way to getting photos that you would be proud to print and display!My camera came with battery fully discharged so I had to wait to charge it before I could try it. The charge does seem to take quite a few hours and the battery charges in camera only. The supplemental battery that came with this kit is a definite plus and I purchased an external charger and 2 more batteries as I plan to use this camera on an upcoming trip to the Caribbean.So shoot in RAW, use Lightroom for a little post-processing and you won't be too disappointed at all. I have yet to try the wifi feature, the apps or the video capabilities but as soon as I do, I will edit my review accordingly. In the meantime, enjoy!", "Date": "October 21, 2013"}, {"Title": "Good Product", "Author": "Kevin", "ReviewID": "R1PW4S3MITESNV", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "Prime is very good!
