Bought this one as a replacement; however, it quickly became an upgrade. So-o-o-o many additional features, better pixels, stronger zoom, plus all the \"extras\" which when added up separately would cost twice as much as we paid for the package. Great close-ups and distance fotos. We're certain to find additional features as we use this camera more often. We are truly amazed at the intricate details and return of fun when using this Sony!", "Date": "July 6, 2013"}, {"Title": "Package missing items - Product defective", "Author": "PD", "ReviewID": "R1V4CXURANT05W", "Overall": "1.0", "Content": "Ordered this camera package, as it was a good price and included everything we needed.  Order was received quickly, but (same as others reported) seller does NOT include memory card reader or memory card case AS DESCRIBED.Camera worked great for a week, then the screen went bad.  White lines fill about 1/3 of the screen and a big black splotch covered the center.  As this appears to be an LCD screen, the lifespan should be around 10 years ... NOT 7 DAYS!The product was supposed to be new, not refurbished.  It DID have the original seal, so I presume that part of the order was correct.  Thus, I do question whether the product is poorly made or it was luck of the draw getting a bad one.All in all, a bad buying experience.  Luckily, I have had better luck int he past with Amazon. Still, I will likely steer clear of Focus Camera.", "Date": "July 7, 2013"}, {"Title": "Great little camera for bloggers and moms on the go!", "Author": "Pedro Garcia III", "ReviewID": "R56275LX1DGXA", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "Written by Stephanie (wife of the account holder!) After almost a decade of bulkier cameras, I wanted something small enough to tuck in my purse without sacrificing the quality of my images. I've been a Sony user for seven years and after many hours of comparing other options, decided to stay with what was familiar. I'm happy to say I am fully satisfied with my purchase. I love that with the camera cord around my wrist, I can easily manage the camera with one hand while holding a baby on my hip or hanging onto little hands. Meanwhile, I still get great shots to share with long-distance relatives and on our family blog. Five stars to Sony!", "Date": "May 30, 2014"}, {"Title": "Amazing buy", "Author": "Maria Figueroa \"Mari FigRod\"", "ReviewID": "R3UH8J52VSTVSV", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I love this little camera and all its features, especially the ability to shoot pictures when shooting video.

Extra battery a real plus as they are so expensive to replace. Have had this since before Christmas of 2013 and still haven't really gotten into the options for pictures too much but think there are a several there I really want to try more times. Was surprised to find one option that gives a black and white picture with spots of color in the shot. That's the one I would like to try more. Haven't used the option to download via my wireless connection to the computer though. Had some problems with the download from Sony that allows you to work with your pictures and such and removed it from my computer.
