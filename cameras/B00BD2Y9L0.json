My only complaints are the bag is to small and don't even try and use the tri-pod. Tri-pod is made of plastic and not strong enough to hold the camera with all the extras on it. I knew that would probably be the case. I have made great use of everything else and would have had to purchase them if they did not come with the camera.", "Date": "October 22, 2013"}, {"Title": "What a deal!", "Author": "Dissenter \"There is no knowledge that is not ...", "ReviewID": "RQTF7BJ6VWJRL", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "First off this camera is amazing. Yea you can get this camera and lens kit from lots of places, but this is practically like getting a ton of add on items for free. Quality of some of the add on items is a bit low, but when they are giving it away, who cares. The battery grip is not bad at all and beats paying $200 for the Cannon one. Spare battery and filters are a must and the camera bag works for small trips to keep this kit safe. Note, you aren't going to fit much more than the camera and the 24-105mm lens in that bag.", "Date": "July 4, 2013"}], "ProductInfo": {"Price": "$2,499.95", "Features": "KIT INCLUDES 13 PRODUCTS -- All BRAND NEW Items with all Manufacturer-supplied Accessories + Full USA Warranties:\n<1> Canon EOS 6D Digital SLR Camera Body with EF 24-105mm L IS USM Lens + <2> Canon 2400 DSLR Camera Case + <3> Transcend 64GB SDXC 10 Card +\n<4> Battery Grip for Canon 6D + <5> 77mm 3pc (UV/FLD/CPL) Filter + <6> Spare LP-E6 Battery +\n<7> Battery Charger for LP-E6 + <8> Precision Design 58\" Tripod + <9> RC-6 Shutter Remote Control +\n<10> PD 6pc Complete Cleaning Kit + <11> PD Memory Card Storage Wallet + <12> LCD Monitor Screen Protectors + <13> PD SDHC Memory Card Reader", "Name": "Canon EOS 6D Digital SLR Camera Body with EF 24-105mm L IS USM Lens with 64GB Card + Case + Battery & Charger + Battery Grip + Tripod + 3 UV/FLD/CPL Filters Kit", "ImgURL": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/514zPLw0HgL._SY300_.jpg", "ProductID": "B00BD2Y9L0"}}
