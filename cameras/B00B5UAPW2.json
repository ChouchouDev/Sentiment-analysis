{"Reviews": [{"Title": "Great camera - highly recommened!", "Author": "Tim S.", "ReviewID": "R1OUV3UP12GQNC", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I have had this camera for about a month, and it has exceeded my expectations as a still-photography camera. I do a lot of photography at kids sporting events - swim meets, baseball & soccer games - and this camera has helped me capture some really special images in the short time I have owned it. I am pleased with the ability to aggressively crop and frame action shots for maximum effect - the 24 megapixel CMOS sensor is a star performer. One of my favorite tricks is to put the camera in sports mode and turn on continuous shooting; depending on the lighting conditions, it can capture up to about 5-6 frames per second. The 55-300mm lens lets the photographer get right up on the action - even all the way across and Olympic-sized pool or full-size soccer pitch. I also have a 18-55MM lens that works great for indoor settings or situations where the subjects are closer (a similar lens is included in other bundles)I have not used the camera's video capabilities enough to develop an opinion, but that is not why I purchased this camera. It seems to me that of one is looking for a video camera, that are better cheaper options among dedicated video cameras (my opinion).The bundle was thoughtfully assembled, with a 32 MB SD card (holds 4,000 photos at normal resolution), an extra battery, a remote and a backpack to carry it all (including the two other compatible lenses I already owned).I highly recommend the Nikon 5200 as an advanced consumer all-around camera which is particularly well suited to action photography.", "Date": "July 5, 2013"}], "ProductInfo": {"Price": null, "Features": null, "Name": null, "ImgURL": null, "ProductID": "B00B5UAPW2"}}
