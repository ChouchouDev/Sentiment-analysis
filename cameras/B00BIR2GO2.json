I had gone into Best Buy to look at this camera. The camera in store (with no memory storage or extra battery) was as expensive as this complete package. I was a little hesitant about the deal as it seemed too good to be true, but I'm so glad that I went through with buying this camera on Amazon. The only thing that I am struggling with is the WIFI setting. It claims I have found an access point, but always that the signal is too low. I still find it easiest to just plug in the camera to the computer, so I'm not too concerned about this. I have owned sony cyber shot cameras before, and they have really made some great improvements with the many settings this camera has to offer. I am also a fan of the setting wheel rather than the menu keys as well as the zoom knob around the capture button. This camera has both of these qualities I like.", "Date": "July 21, 2013"}, {"Title": "I'm digging it.", "Author": "Michael Collier", "ReviewID": "RF7UYGWA4CTMO", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I was looking for a compact camera with great resolution and this does just that.  I was comparing this with some of the cannon compacts and decided for higher resolution and less zoom and instead of lower resolution and more zoon from the cannon.I've owned prior models of sony cybershot camera's and this one does the job.  Easy to point and shoot, easy to setup and has a lot of options 'maybe too many for a compact' but lots of options.  Flash works much better than i thought i would for such a small flash.  The 25mm lens captures the room well.  The pictures so far are vibrant.  I'm looking forward to using it more.There were some poor reviews about battery life.  It looks like it was last a few hours if just shooting pictures and I'm totally ok with that.  I bought the kit form focus and it came with a spare anyways that will fit in your change pocket so if you're going to be shoot a ton, take a spare.  Overall I'm very happy and the kit was a steal vs buying the camera alone.  I would recommend to a friend.", "Date": "May 5, 2013"}, {"Title": "I love this camera!", "Author": "VickyW", "ReviewID": "R2FJV0U4759SV5", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I was recently in the market for a new camera after destroying yet another one (yeah, I'm a klutz), and especially wanting to get something that would take excellent video. I'd been using Canon Powershots for several years, and originally I had been satisfied with them, but more and more I was becoming frustrated with the video limitations. I like to shoot live musicians in dark clubs and with the Powershot it was tough to get it to focus quickly in dark conditions; plus, once you started shooting video you could still zoom but there was no way to refocus. Seeing better videos produced by others that had been shot with different cameras, I knew there were better options out there. Plus, the older Powershot I had was pretty heavy and hard to hold steady for long periods if recording several songs. Which was probably one reason why I kept dropping the damn thing. My criteria for a new camera were: 1) Excellent video capability; 2)Lightweight; 3)Reasonably priced, ideally under $200.After researching various consumer sources and looking at Amazon reviews, I was finding it hard to make a selection. Then I came upon the listing for this camera. At the time it had all good reviews and seemed to meet all of my criteria. I decided to go for it. And boy, am I glad I did! In addition to taking excellent photos in all lighting conditions, I tried it out last weekend at a dark club and was thrilled with the videos I ended up with. I like how it has a one-touch button for video and self-correcting focus, so if you are trying to follow an active performer's movements across the stage it continually refocuses for you. My videos were crystal clear and the sound quality was phenomenal, considering I was in a small club with overamplified sound. I could not have been more delighted. I brought two fully-charged batteries and was able to get about 10 songs on the first battery; after 9 songs the second battery was still good. It felt like nothing in my hands and was very easy to hold, easy to turn on and off. The one issue I have with it is that it is a bit challenging to remove the battery and so if one wanted to change batteries quickly I found that to be difficult. But otherwise it surpassed my expectations. I was able to take a great picture of a spiderweb that was invisible when I took a pic of it with my phone; as an experiment I took a photo of a dark museum exhibit with no flash and it came out as if there had been light. I am very pleased with this camera and highly recommend it.", "Date": "October 2, 2013"}, {"Title": "Compact and practical", "Author": "c_busta", "ReviewID": "R307QYTAXYVG9V", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I bought this camera for my girlfriend and it has been amazing. She always takes pictures of friends and everything when we go out, and later posts them on facebook. The camera is very small so she has no problem carrying it around and the wifi function allows her to connect the camera to her smartphone and save pictures there or upload them to the internet from the phone. The wifi function also enables using the smartphone as a remote control/second screen, so you can set it on a table and see on the phones screen where the lens is pointing, zoom in or out and take the picture.Pictures look great night or day and there are a lot of manual funtions, ISO settings and other things to play around with for more advanced users. It also tells you if someone blinked whie taking the picture, takes multiple pics and choses the best one, fixes skin imperfections and other things which we really have not messed around with much.

I had only looked at a couple, and saw this one in the store, and liked the look, and the clarity it gives.In owning it, I am not 100% sure it does what I expected, but for the price, and for what I want to use it for, it does GREAT!!! I can't expect more from something that I didn't pay alot for.. but... with that said.. this little guy does a WHOLE lot of things, that every time I sit and play with it, I find something new.Some complain about no charger, but I have one in my camera box that CAME with it. So I am not sure.  You can do it 2 ways, with your computer via USB or with plugging it in and charging it that way. The charging of the battery is done with the battery IN the camera.

With this, I can now use in the car too, but so far, once I charge the battery, it lasts me all day.I love the size of this camera, I love the shots that I have gotten.

That intrigued me and even though my trusty w560 is still in perfect working order besides for the charger, I decided to upgrade. What I have discovered is that I need a point and shoot with the low light capabilities of this camera.It's really amazing to be able to take decent pics indoors without the windows open or using the flash. This camera can do it. This camera also has a host of neat little shooting modes and color options as well as being capable of HD video with stereo sound. I have played with this camera for a week now and I'm still discovering new things buried in the menus. I'm very happy with my 150 dollar purchase and it's worth every penny.Now for the cons. The build of this camera is smaller than my w560 and feels more flimsy. The smallness isn't a problem but coupled with the plastic feel it's a little bothersome as far as worrying about damaging the camera. The shutter button is also another issue, at least on my camera. The zoom function is tied into the shutter button and it will actually rattle if I shake the camera gently. I thought I had broken my camera when I used the zoom function the first time, it moves around and isn't seated firmly at all. It doesn't seem very stout and able to put up with much use. The screen is smaller than I imagined which is just a nit-pick.The anti-shake technology also isn't everything the company preaches it is. In low light it does much better than a normal camera however hand shake is an issue. I mean if you can hold as still as is humanly possible you can get some great shots but if your subject is moving or you are moving for any reason, the image isn't usable which I expected. Even my Sony CMOS DSLR has issues with low light without using flash but the company shouldn't use the anti-shake in low light as a selling point making people believe something that isn't even possible with more professional products from this brand.Having said all that, this camera is still deserving of 4 stars. Only the build and the bit of flamboyant marketing is questionable about this camera. I am a firm believer in Sony as being more bang for the buck and this camera is not an exception.The included case is a bit tight-fitting and there aren't any pockets for storing anything, just the camera and a lens cloth.  However for the price it's very acceptable and I use it constantly to protect the camera.  The memory card is great and as of now, after taking almost 500 pics I still have room for 1500 more.  The extra battery is perfect and fits my old camera as well.  I didn't get the screen protectors but I have the lens cloth in the bottom of the case and I use it frequently.  I must also mention this camera charges the battery while in the camera so I went ahead and bought a wall charger since that's what I set out to do in the first place.  So now I have three batteries that fit both my cameras and a charger.", "Date": "September 4, 2013"}, {"Title": "Good point and shoot", "Author": "Reviewer", "ReviewID": "R8DT6S26ISD5M", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I'm happy with this camera.

I would have given it a 5 except for the complexity of the controls and user interface.  I have an SLR as my primary camera, and this is my third cybershot used as a back-up/snapshot unit.  My hands are pretty large and it is very difficult to manipulate the controls, not unexpected in a unit this compact.  Controls and settings are not intuitive, and once you accidentally get into a menu there is no graceful way out (no equivalent \"escape\" key) and I find my self using the power switch to get back.  Like the panorama feature,and the photos are crisp and well balanced right out of the box.  Would suggest covering the display with a protector sheet, it does not seem to be as hard as most other current technology.  Flash is very weak,disappointing beyond about 10 feet.  My other Cybershots were good well beyond that range, but were larger and thus had more battery capacity.  Bottom line, package deal was a good value since it included a spare battery and a 16G flash card.

I only gave it 4 stars because I can't seem to get it to connect to my computer and you have to connect it to set up the wi-fi feature.

It takes creditable pictures and video for my use, but someone more discriminating might find the camera lacking.  The best suggestion I can give is this:  if you are clumsy (like me) or you need a substantial frame to hold on to while operating the camera, be sure to install and use the string safety loop that comes with the camera.  This sucker is slippery.  As for the rest of the kit, I have only used the case so far.

It takes excellent indoor shots and it has so many extra features that I'm still figuring them all out. I cook a lot and have a food blog and there is a \"food\" option in the scene section, one of the many reasons I chose this camera. It has smart focus which works wonderfully.There are a couple things I\"m not thrilled with on this camera.1. The plug in port for the cord on the camera is crap and is asking to break. It barely goes in and you have to shove it in which is going to make the port inside the camera loose. I've seen this with crappy cell phone ports.2. I also find the wifi loading feature for pictures to be VERY slow. We have excellent internet and everything else we have wirelessly works great but the camera takes far too long to send pics wirelessly, it's easier to plug it in and send them. I also think the cord is far too short, no case (we got the one without a case).3. Not charging while plugged in to the computer USB port. I loved this with our old camera, now it states that this camera does charge while plugged in but I have not seen that happen. It is always dead when I plug it in over night and even when it's not in sleep mode it doesn't seem to be charging. Maybe i\"m not doing something right but anything I have ever used that plugged in for charging was simple. Plug it in and the light came on and it charged. This is not doing that.Overall it's a pretty good camera. It takes great pics and the color is amazing! I am very happy with it.
