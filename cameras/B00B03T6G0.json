If you don't want to spend the money or have the need for the drop-proof, water-proof, etc.-proof WG series from Pentax, this fits-in-your-pocket camera is ideal. Yes, this is not a DSLR, but try to fit the K-5 in your pocket.", "Date": "April 24, 2013"}], "ProductInfo": {"Price": "$100.00", "Features": "PENTAX Optio LS465 (Ruby Pink)", "Name": "Pentax Optio LS465 Compact Camera, Ruby Pink US 14071", "ImgURL": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/51NeZbacTaL._SY300_.jpg", "ProductID": "B00B03T6G0"}}
