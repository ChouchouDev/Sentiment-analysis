photographer and take most of my pix on vacation or at big family events, but i do see the difference between good and \"ok\" photos/video.  also, i really value quality photos and easy-to-use video -- if it's easy, you'll use it.  if it's high quality, you'll love using it.After investing several hours reviewing all the underwater camera reviews for 2013, i chose this one without the GPS.  what an amazing camera.we took it on a caribb. cruise where we took photos and videos while snorkeling, while in tropical waterfalls, and while doing \"normal\" non-water oriented activities.  the attached video is taken from the surface on an overcast day.  i've also downloaded a few photos.  i think i'm limited to one video, so i've included only underwater.  the dry-land video quality is excellent for viewing on my computer, but i haven't yet tried it on the 55\" HDTV.i spent the 2 hour flight reading the paper handbook and testing and learning the camera.  it was a worthwhile investment of time, as i learned all of the camera's tricks and abilities.  it has a lot of nice little features you wouldn't expect and are not mentioned in other reviews/descriptions.  i recommend this to everyone.the good/great:photo quality, above and below watervideo quality and sound, above and below water - amazing, really.ease of usedurability - no concerns about my teens dropping itsize -- it's a little bigger than non-durable digital cameras, but well worth it.  my 14 yr old son likes cameras that he can fit in his pocket.  at first he was a little disappointed with the size, because it doesn't really fit in his shorts pocket, but after using the camera, it's now his favorite.3\" screen - works great, even in direct sun and under water.  we have another digital cameras with 2\" screens, and the 3\" is much better.buttons -- very easy to use underwater.  your fingers dont slip and you can easily do whatever you need.the editing options -- while the pix are still on the camera, you can crop and do other editing and save the edited pix as a new image.  you can also get 3 stills from any video you take.the bad:nothing, really, but if i was being really picky ........=> the battery didn't last as long as i would like -- will not last a whole day of heavy \"we are on vacation use\".  so, i strongly recommend a back-up battery whereever you go.  per another Amazon review, i bought the Wasabi dual battery package with charger and did not notice any difference between the Wasabi and Pentax batteries.  SEE MORE BELOW - IMPORTANT.=> the biner clip and strap-- i always use a wrist strap, so i dont worry when leaning over a cliff or balcony that i'll drop the  camera by accident.  i had to poach a wrist strap from another camera because the WG-3's carribiner and strap dont give any protection from dropping the camera.  they are cute, but not so functional.  i'll probably convert them to a keychain.  even though the camera is extremely durable, it's too clunky and heavy to hang from my belt-loop and feel safe.=>  size - see above.  a little bigger than ideal, but this is the cost of true, 45-foot underwater abilities.=>  you should have at least one finger-nail.  some of the buttons on the round \"ok\" button area are a bit close together and i find the one at \"9 o'clock\" difficult to hit just right.  i dont have large fingers, but i found no problem when using my fingernail on that one particular button.  if i had no fingernails, i would probably repeatedly hit the wrong button by accident.  this button isn't important for taking pictures or video, but is for reviewing and editing.although the camera is waterproof, it is not sink-proof.  we got the Chums wrist strap.  it works just fine to keep the camera afloat in our test and has a very functional clip so you can easily remove and replace the big floatation device.  here's the link:  http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B003CK10DG/ref=oh_details_o01_s00_i02?ie=UTF8&psc;=1OVERALL IMPRESSIONS:  an excellent camera.  when i showed the grandparents the snorkeling shots and video from the PC, they couldn't believe we got such amazing shots from such a small and seemingly-normal camera.  And only $300!a word on sellers -- at first, and a week before the trip, i bought an orange WG-3 from a seller on Amazon (we figured orange would be easier to find/recognize than black).  they said they would deliver within 2-3 days, so we would get the camera in time for our trip.  5 days later, they still hadn't even shipped it.  so, i cancelled that camera and bought a black WG-3 direct from Amazon for an add'l $12 and i splurged on the $3.99 for the guaranteed next-day delivery (we are Prime members).  it arrived the following day, giving me time to charge the batteries, make sure it worked, etc.  Moral of this anecdote:  buy from Amazon.a word on the battery and for when you first get the camera -- the battery arrived 100% dead.  i put the battery in and tried using the camera immediately.  it didn't work.  the camera has a charging cable that attaches to the battery box in the camera, so you can charge the battery without a separate charging device.  when you do this, a green light illuminates on the \"on/off\" button.  when i first opened the camera, i tried using the cable to charge the battery via the camera.  it didn't work either and the green light didn't illuminate.  i thought the camera was a dud.  then i used the charging device that came with the Wasabi batteries -- it plugs into a regular wall outlet.  that worked.  ever since, i've been able to use the charging cable and the green light illuminates, but at first it didn't.  dont know what i would have done if i hadn't also bought a wall charger for the batteris.a word on accessories -- i recommend the following:  a wall charger for the battery; an extra battery; a high quality SD card (do some research - following the lead of another reviewer, i like the Patriot 32G - worked great for pix and video); a floatation wrist strap that is strong enough for the weight of this slightly larger camera; screen protectors;  a bag (again, check the size; we used a neoprene case that can get wet, so we wore the camera on our hip/neck while we trecked up waterfalls and had no worries); a regular wrist strap, as the floating ones are big and unnecessary on land.good luck!", "Date": "April 7, 2013"}, {"Title": "First Impressions - Nice!", "Author": "AdobemanAZ", "ReviewID": "R3PJCISH1QJOOS", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I purchased the Pentax Optio WG-3 GPS (Purple) here at Amazon and this is a first impression review.1) Decision: Prior to purchase I had to decide between the new Olympus TG-2 (tough camera) and this new Pentax model.  The specs are for the most part are comparable (we'll let the hard-core techies split hairs in their reviews), but i was leaning toward the Olympus because it had nice styling and I have had positive experiences with other Olympus camera models. But I decided on the Pentax because I liked that they added the LED ring of lights to assist the microscope mode.  Also, the camera comes with a snap on MACRO mount for use in the microscope mode.2) Look and Feel: The camera is well-built feels heavy (but in a solid kind of way).  The body is a hard plastic that almost feels like a rubber texture.  The LED display is a 16x9 style that is vibrant when reviewing photos and video.  You have to add your own SD card.  I had a 2GB SanDisk Extreme III available and inserted in the battery compartment, then formatted using the menu system (Note: It formatted blazingly fast..in less than a second!).  I decided not to attach the strap with carabiner that came in the box.  Since I have a travel pouch for the camera, I preferred to attached a wrist strap I had lying around instead.  The unit comes with a thick manual and a USB cable and associated plug-in charger.  What is not included with the camera is a Micro/Mini HDMI cable for A/V-out.3) Start-up and Menu: When you first start-up, the camera has you perform the standard date, time, time-zone type of set-up.  Then you are ready to go (Note: I charged the battery for about an hour prior to using the camera, but I think it was pretty-much factory shipped fully charged.  The menu system seems like all the other digital cameras on the market - a little awkward; but keep in mind this is my first day with the camera and with experience I'll adapt to the particulars of this camera's menu system.4) Photos:  I took a walk with the camera just before sunset where there were a lot of light contrasts; then just after the sun went down, I photographed in twilight. First look at the photos with the fast F2.0 lens were impressive!  Colors really popped in some flowers even in twilight.  Nice contrast between colors in cityscape murals.  Dialed up to 16-megapixels and zoomed 4x to try to see an architectural rendering on a sign I could barely make out in a building from the road.  After taking the picture I was able to zoom in and not only see the architectural rendering but even read words on this sign that I couldn't see from the ground.When I got home I tried the microscope mode which was an important reason why I purchased the camera in the first place.  I attached the marco stand and took a photo of a nickel.  The camera took a second to focus and the picture came out crisp.  The LED lights illuminated the coin and due to the reflection, the edges around the coin were somewhat overexposed.  I will have to experiment more, but the microscope mode worked as advertised seeing all sorts of micro-scratches on the coin face.There are so many features I have not tried yet like the GPS; and I'll update my review as time goes on.  Overall, the pictures were really good.  The reason I'm giving it 5-stars at this point, is because the features that I purchased the camera for worked as advertised. And again the photo quality is to my satisfaction.  I also do a lot of outdoor work where I need a camera to document progress for myself and customers.  I don't want to have to worry about dust, rain and dirty hands.  Note there is a time-elapsed feature that I have yet to try.I don't plan to use this camera for underwater activities, but like I said earlier, there will be testers and evaluation websites that will put this new camera through all sorts of tests in the weeks ahead.  But if you're ready now, I say go for it.  Unless you get one DOA, you probably won't be disappointed.Note: There is another customer review here on Amazon of this camera on 4/1/2013 that gave it 2-stars.  The person said they had the camera boxed for return within 5-minutes due to poor picture quality.  I would not take this review too seriously.  This person obviously took no time to ensure they had proper settings or conditions.  This is Pentax's 15th generation of tough camera evolution and they have a good reputation for hardware quality.  Keep all this in mind when making your decision to buy or not.", "Date": "April 24, 2013"}, {"Title": "I am now a Pentax fan!", "Author": "Phone Bill", "ReviewID": "RV01DRI1MANV3", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I have owned several Canon cameras over the years, going back to the days before digital photography. I was always pleased with the quality of their equipment and the photographs they produced. When I needed a camera to use while snorkeling, I first bought a Sony TX-10, which takes a nice picture, but is not as durable as I had hoped it would be. My current choices came down to the newest models by Olympus and Pentax. I am very pleased with this Pentax Optio WG-3. Pentax has managed to take something as delicate and fragile as a digital camera and make it truly tough.The things I most like about this camera so far are:-- it appears to be very durable.-- it has a nicely balanced feel.-- the photos look great!-- there are lots of different shooting modes, including time lapse, and macro.-- it is plenty waterproof for snorkeling and kayaking.The only negative I have seen so far is, like most digital cameras, the battery life isn't great. But a couple of spare batteries solves that issue.I have not yet tested the underwater video mode, which is the main reason I purchased this camera. But based on the initial results from still shots and regular video, this camera is a winner.That's why I am now a Pentax fan.", "Date": "April 28, 2013"}, {"Title": "backpacker's dream", "Author": "tom s", "ReviewID": "R3U0X3GMO8252S", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "Pentax has defined a new niche -- rugged camera + gps. Camera (and video) is state of art, with fast lens (for low light shooting) and convenient design. The GPS, compass, and altitude info are useful for hiking. You can hold the camera lcd horizontal like a compass. Records picture locations and pathway gps data. The camera is tough but not invincible; manual says \"don't hold in waterfall\" and \"don't dive into water with it\" (because of high pressure changes?). But you can take underwater pix & movies, leave it out in the rain, or drop it a meter. Takes nice 1080 HD movies though focusing creates sound. Camera is bulkier than a cell phone, equals about 3 iPhones; big for pockets but it will fit. Easy to hold onto w/ ergo shape and grip.NOTEs AFTER USING: Takes great pix/movies. Worked well while snorkeling. Camera is well-designed but complex, with a learning curve, although there are simple shooting modes. When tired near end of a hot hike, I (a seasoned Pentax photog) had difficulties with some advanced functions. Largely this is because of the many options, allowing it to do many things (such as time lapse movies, very macro pix, 28 different modes!). Battery life is quite long. Shoots fairly fast and there are consecutive-shot modes (which I haven't explored yet). Keep the manual on hand for advanced functions (curious shoppers can download the manual and 2 quick guides from Pentax). Given what it can do, the design is thoughtful and user friendly.CONCLs after more use. It is a great technical marriage of camera + gps + waterproof, designed for the hand but not the pocket. All works well with the minor exception that the night pix have some noise at large sizes, as labs have noted. The camera is not simple; I still confuse the similar on-off and shutter buttons (similar because of waterproof design?). I'm happy with the camera, but I have a Pentax DSLR that is great for civilization and easy to use. If I were to have only one camera, I would opt for something (Pentax for me) more camera-like and only weatherproof, because modern cameras (at least the well-human-engineered ones) are great for picture taking. The WG-3 GPS is well engineered for its purposes and I look forward to my next hike with it.", "Date": "April 5, 2013"}, {"Title": "30 days ok ... but after that..? 2nd time around", "Author": "xerxes", "ReviewID": "R3F4Y77STML82E", "Overall": "2.0", "Content": "Having had the Pentax Optio line of cameras for several years, I decided to upgrade to the WG3. Product arrived on time, (arrived June 15) set up was a snap as it is basically the same as others in this family.I use the camera primarily for progress shots on my large industrial construction projects and don't have to worry about dust or banging it on a scaffold or whatever.. ideal camera for my intended purpose.... until today.The zoom function stopped working completely, no zoom at all. Changed batteries ( I know that had really no bearing on the problem but made me feel better), fiddled with various menu functions - but the zoom is pretty straightforward and still not working. Very disappointed at this development.. The camera is going back and I will likely order another one in the hope that this experience was just a  one off and not indicative of the entire line***Update***The second camera arrived and I used it with no problems - no underwater stuff, just jobsite progress pictures. At about the same time frame as the previous unit,the SAME problem occurred i.e the zoom stopped working. Searching for a second opinion I contacted \"Just Answer\" and their analysis was that the plastic gears controlling the zoom had stripped and as the item is still under warranty I should return it... I'm not too optimistic about going through this a third time  especially as I bought additional batteries and wall charger, and don't want to get stuck with several batteries and returning cameras every 60 daysThe unit feels good in the hand and does do it's job - most of the time, but for this price point I expect all the functions to work normally for longer than 60 days - return to Amazon imminent", "Date": "July 15, 2013"}, {"Title": "Love this camera", "Author": "Noah", "ReviewID": "R3W2E2JOCOA6ZP", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I never leave reviews unless I'm either very upset, or head-over-heels.My dad is a photographer and had the WG-II laying around and I asked if I could borrow it for my backpack trip to Israel.

It's annoying how much I love this camera.couple of cons: (not really cons, more recommendations.)1) The battery life is decent, but if you are on a trip and away from an outlet for more than a day, buy additional batteries. you will use them.2) buy the 32g SD card. enough room you won't have to worry about taking too many pictures before you transfer to a computer.bottom-line: Buy this camera.", "Date": "August 11, 2013"}, {"Title": "Trip of a lifetime - very happy", "Author": "SJR \"SJR\"", "ReviewID": "R2HBU0EBY1ECRK", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "I strapped this camera to a waterproof backpack and backpacked 5 days through the Hell's Gate Wilderness in AZ (Tonto creek).  It is a trip I only intended to do once as it is a brutal as it is scenic.  I wanted a rugged waterproof camera, and this did not disappoint.  The camera was either in water, or in a soaked camera case for 5 days straight - only drying out at night when we made camp.  Definitely held up on waterproof.  Day 2 or 3 I fumbled the camera and dropped it from waist high to a wet boulder - yay, impact resistance!  No visible damage!  I left the camera in landscape mode the entire trip - pictures came out beautiful.  Picture quality is excellent with vibrant lifelike color.  Don't know if it is shutter speed or image stabilization, but all pics I took were clear.  I thought I might have a few blurry pics because I was swimming as I was snapping pics, but the only flawed pics I had were where I had a big water drop on the lens (one or two of those out of 300+).

Went on vacation to Hawaii and was looking for a camera that would be ideal for taking pictures while snorkeling.  Out of the package, took a lot of test pictures before using it and the quality was pretty good.  The exterior has a rugged feel to it and saw that the battery/sd card compartment has a double lock to ensure it does not accidentally open up, especially if it is in a wet environment.  Once on vacation, tried turning on the camera and it would power up and immediately power back down.  To eliminate the possibility that the camera got turned on during the flight, recharged the battery and again it would power up and then power back down.  Actually had to hit the camera real hard with my hand to get it to start working right.  On the first day of snorkeling, while trying to learn how to use it in the water, the camera took pretty good quality shots.  I was actually happy with the test shots in the water,  The second time out was when the issues started happening.  While taking pictures in the water, the camera started turning off again for no reason.  Once out of the water, saw that the double lock was still engaged and after making sure the camera was dry, upon opening the battery/sd cover, noticed that it was wet inside and it appeared the battery \"blew up\" or started leaking.  There was a green substance oozing out the area where the battery pins were.  It appears the housing may have leaked due to the moisture in the housing.  When the camera was operational it did take pretty decent quality shots and its many features are useful.  I have never had any issues with Pentax cameras and they are usually super reliable.  I will be returning this camera and hopefully, it is just a \"lemon\".", "Date": "September 6, 2013"}, {"Title": "Camera failed in 10ft of water", "Author": "Nemo", "ReviewID": "RGOTGVARIT3D0", "Overall": "2.0", "Content": "I bought this camera specifically for its underwater capabilities.

I've been wanting a better solution for paddling trips and hikes than my cheap Kodak C123 waterproof point-and-click.  I tried a few dry bags for my Nikon cameras, but none gave me easy access to the controls I desired.  So I looked around for a better waterproof solution and I decided on this Pentax after comparing offerings and reading other product reviews here.  After 6 months of use, I still love this little camera.1) The ergonomics are excellent: All of the typical point-and-shoot buttons are where you expect (shutter, zoom, playback, etc.), the screen is large and fairly bright, the rubber grip surfaces make this thing hard to fumble, and the rugged shock-resistant case make it no problem if you do.  Only the power button is in a bad place, right next to the shutter release.  More than once I turned off the camera by mistake instead of getting that great shot.2) Zoom and focus: The (limited) optical zoom is a great feature, not found in most underwater cameras in this class.  Zoom speed is respectable and I like that I can disable digital zoom and leave optical zoom enabled.  With responsive 9-point AF, Spot AF, Auto tracking AF and pan focusing, it rivals the AF abilities of an entry level Nikon or Canon DLSR.3) Flash:  The main flash is bright and nicely diffused.  The supplemental high intensity LED lights help capture those interior candid shots and reduce a lot of grain.  They also serve to identify where in the frame faces are detected for those all important \"selfies.\"  This seemed like a gimmick when I read it but I've used the feature quite a lot at parties to get myself in the pic.4) Camera modes: This camera has a lot of modes.  I would encourage any new user to take a few hours, read through the manual with camera in hand and try some of them.  They include a 3 panel landscape panorama stitching mode that works almost as well as Photoshop, and a 2 panel portrait stitching mode that results in a nice high res landscape frame.  Other features like white balance adjust, and fun filters like sepia (2 hughes) make this a very practical day-to-day walking around camera.5) GPS: works well and geotags the images' EXIF data just as expected.  The GPS tracking feature is fun for hikes or other trips and creates a file that can be uploaded to your favorite trip tracking site.  (I use everytrail.com)Note: With the GPS receiver turned on, the batteries will drain over time even with the camera off.  This is the only place where a dedicated button (gps on/off) would have been very useful instead of digging 3 levels down the menu tree to do it.6) Battery life: is pretty good considering the 16Mpx sensor, optical zoom and large LCD display.  I also bought the Wasabi Power Battery (2-Pack) and Charger for Pentax D-LI92 and Pentax Optio I-10, RZ10, RZ18, WG-1, WG-1 GPS, WG-2, WG-2 GPS, WG-3, WG-3 GPS, WG-10, X70 here and it's saved my bacon a few times to have spare batteries handy.7) I don't find the front LCD for altitude very helpful, and not very accurate, but no GPS device I own gives accurate altitude readings around here so I can't say that's the camera's fault.  It can also show time with the built-in alarm but I haven't used that feature.8)  Compass: The electronic compass, on the other hand, is very useful and seems to be more accurate than my android phones or other GPS receivers I have.  I've used it a couple of times to position antennae and get a quick bearing on a trail.9)  Wireless charging: I was very excited when first opened the box to see the QI label on the case.  It was an unadvertised feature that I use all the time to keep the camera charged on a QI compatible wireless charging pad.  This is a great convenience, and since you have to open the waterproof door to get to the USB port to internally charge the battery, that saves on the life of the seal somewhat too.10) I find it hard to find anything to complain about with this camera.  So I'll just mention that in full sunlight the LCD is a bit hard to see especially with the sun behind you (where you want it most shots) so I may put on a Delkin Devices DU3.0-M BLK Universal Pop-Up Shade for 3.0-Inch LCDs (Black) to cut glare.  So, besides my nits about the power button placement, the menu navigation to turn the GPS on/off and the less than brilliant (see what I did there!) LCD display, this is a perfect camera for it's intended function and then some.

Worked great, no problems.  That evening I washed it under tap water to remove any sand/salt residue and then opened it up.  I found a tiny amount of sand had gotten past the seal but no water.  I blew out the sand and made sure it was sealing correctly.  As the camera had many bad reviews before I was extra careful to make sure I did everything right.January 9th, day 2, I'm back in the ocean.  Not 5 minutes after I turn it on it turns itself off.  It refuses to power back up.  I give up and spend the rest of my time at the beach not using it.  That afternoon I get back to my hotel and open it up, it's flooded with sea water.  The seal completely failed.This camera is junk.  DO NOT BUY.  I wish there was a 0-star option because this product just doesn't do what it's supposed to do.Original review below, published on January 4th 2014, prior to vacation:I was a little hesitant to purchase this camera because some of the other reviews suggested that it's build quality was poor and there were many problems with leaking.  I'm happy to report that I've had no such problems after a month of testing.To the people who had leaking issues, did you actually lock both locks on the battery door?  It's not tight until you do.Did you let your kids play with the camera?  The battery door isn't super strong, if you open it and then keep pushing you're going to bend the hinge, then it won't seal properly next time you close it.", "Date": "January 4, 2014"}, {"Title": "Love this Camera !", "Author": "Virgi", "ReviewID": "R346E5Y4ZE1HOB", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I have had great point and shoot cameras,but this one is by far the best choice made.Just the Macro is worth th money,it gives you crisp,sharp images like the SLR Rebel that I have.

The video it shoots is extremely solid and in good lighting situations the photos are crisp. I love using this camera for macro shots, especially at night because they come out looking really brilliant. The time-lapse function is incredibly flexible and I have made some brilliant time lapse videos with this thing. HDR works well and doesn't blur, the high-speed video function is a nice trick to show off and the GPS/Compass combo provides very useful and precise location and direction data.There were two features that I didn't find listed during my research that are very important:First, VIDEO AUTOFOCUS. This was a huge surprise to me and although I had gotten used to the fixed focus on the WG-2, this feature was a fantastic surprise and it works smoothly in both regular and macro focus modes.Second, LIVE GPS DATA. To activate electronic compass function you hit the OK button and cycle through the different on-screen display set-ups. When you get to the compass function, if you have the GPS function active and you have a signal, it shows you're current readout live. The ability to see this data live rather than having to wait and read the metadata later is really useful for off-camera geocache logging and navigation purposes.", "Date": "January 8, 2014"}, {"Title": "A lot of fun, love it!", "Author": "Syncro", "ReviewID": "R2OLGE2V4KFQZ6", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I've used this camera a fair amount camping and mountain bike riding. The one word that best describes it is FUN! Its durable and worry proof in a jacket pocket, but most important it is a camera that is actually there with you to capture the action. It feels good in the hand, enough heft to inspire confidence, and the shape allows a firm grip. There is a radius area on the top which forms a natural secure fit for your fingers.Some reviews nit pick minute details, but bottom line is it takes great pictures with good color and is a great all around camera. It really shines for close ups, and the microscope mode is incredible. Detailed pictures of insects etc. are a snap.Things I really like:By holding the \"OK\" button down a few seconds, a colorful analog clock appears on the screen along with date and digital time. I've used this a lot, not only for night time, as its a handy feature, plus the camera auto shuts off after 10 seconds. It also has a flashlight mode. Both of these features only work with the camera \u201coff\u201d.Low light images are fine, providing the auto ISO settings are kept reasonable. I have mine set to auto range from 125-800 which works pretty well, the f 2 lens no doubt helps. The flash easily fills an average room, yet throttles down for exceptional close ups. Much better than I expected for a point and shoot camera. All together I see no issues with low light situations.Optical zoom is \u201conly\u201d 4x, but combined with the 'intelligent' digital zoom it was adequate. My choice, as with any camera, is to not use the digital zoom beyond the \u201cintelligent zoom\u201d setting. The camera also has a histogram mode that is easily switched on. For those that may not be familiar, a histogram quickly shows parts of a frame that are either under or over exposed. Outdoor photos are also good and the wide 18mm lens really takes in a lot of scenery. The panorama mode, which joins adjoining shots together, while not perfect, is for sure fun to play with.Contrary to some reviews I find the menu and controls quite easy to use. There is a handy mode button which presents all of the camera's capture modes on an easily selectable screen with recognizable icons. I can't see it getting much more simpler than that. The 4 way rocker is a little small, but clearly marked and usable. Don't try it with gloves, but really, what point and shoot camera can. It also has a dedicated video button, so no menu required to take movies.Pentax cameras also feature what they call a \u201cGreen Button\u201d. This is pretty neat, as pressing the green button puts the camera in a pre-set picture mode regardless of any custom settings that are being used. The purpose is to allow for a fast photo of an unexpected event.  Press the green button again and you're back to your custom settings.Concerning under water use, personally I do not trust ANY of the point and shoot so-called waterproof cameras for true use under water. Examine how any of these cameras seal themselves, regardless of brand, then look at what the pros use. All real underwater cameras have a separate waterproof case that has heavier O-ring seals with solid even pressure latches. My personal view of this camera, and others in this class, is they are rugged and great for wet areas, dust, snow, and if dropped in a stream they will survive. While I did try it for a brief under water video with no issues, no way would I take it or any other camera that was not in a separate water tight case snorkeling or other continuous under water use.Somethings I didn't like:While there is a neat video function that allows for time lapse recording (lots of possibilities here)  the shortest interval is 1 min per exposure. That may be fine for watching a flower bloom or long sunset, but limits time lapse for many other uses. I'd have liked shorter intervals, perhaps in 10 second increments from zero up to 1 minute.The flashlight mode is handy and readily turned on even if the camera is switched off, however it's not very bright. It's better than nothing in a dark room and handy for having motorists see you on a dark street, but not a true flashlight.Pentax supplies one battery and no external charger. Fortunately extra batteries and an external charger are readily available at reasonable prices on line. Of interest I found that after a decent, but not stellar time, the battery indicator would start to diminish. By chance I found that if I remove the battery and then re-insert it the charge indicator came back up to full charge and stayed there for considerable more use.Video mode allows for slow motion (shoots at twice the normal speed for the appearance of slow motion playback) great feature, but it is limited to just 25 seconds of recording. Speaking of video, the camera takes nice crisp HD movies with good color, however not as good as some higher priced true video cameras. Also, the internal zoom lens mechanism is quite audible when using the optical zoom, only way to avoid a loud gear noise when zooming is to either not use the optical zoom when videoing or to just use the digital zoom range which is completely silent. I don't see any of this as deal breakers, just be aware this cameras video mode is not for making an Oscar award feature movie. Nonetheless, you'll still get good looking video to capture fun events in a rough environment.Bottom line is this is really a great go anywhere rugged camera that is a blast to own and use. Be sure to apply a screen protector before serious use, if this camera is used in its natural rough element the glass screen needs protection.

That GPS drain is a really annoying issue to me.  I love the macro ability, though the super macro can be frustratingly slow to focus.  The macro lights are handy.  The noise reduction can be pretty destructive to high ISO image details, so you will do well to limit the range (see the manual and/or menus).

They would be spending some time \"in the water\" (Black Sea) and wanted a camera that was compact and would not take much space in luggage and be VERY durable.  After some research we decided on this camera and it is VERY good.Ironically it did not get used for \"underwater\" pictures (though ample other reviewers have posted about this capability) it did extremely well at other duties.Pros:1.  Takes great pictures.  While it is not a DSLR the pictures it takes are very good.  The clarity is outstanding.  They also took some pictures at dusk and at night in Amsterdam and they turned out very clear considering how low the ambient light was.2.  Plenty sturdy.  We needed a camera that we would not be panicing if our 5-year-old daughter picked it up and started snapping pictures.  It performed perfectly.  Not a nick or a scratch, much less damage that would prevent proper functioning.  This does not mean it was not dropped, but that it held up admirably.3.  Lightweight.  What we hadn't considered and turned into a HUGE advantage is that it is lightweight.  Not just for carrying around but our daughter could easily hold it and point where she wanted.  We have a larger DSLR type camera and sometimes the large lens out in front makes it unwieldy for her.  She is easily able to handle this camera.4. Compact design.  It doesn't take much room in luggage AND it can be easily slipped in a pocket in case a great \"photo op\" arrives.  This was a large part of our decision and we were thrilled with the results.Cons:1.  Battery Life.  Though I don't know how many pictures it can take before requiring \"re-charge\" we quickly came to the conclusion to always have a charged spare battery with us.  The camera comes with 1 battery but about $30 bought us 2 additional batteries, a car adapter charger, and a wall charger (Wasabi Power Battery 2 Pack Charger  This is money very well spent.2.  Not much \"zoom.\"  You have to give up something and, all things being equal, I like more zoom.  This works OK for \"snapshots\" but if we were trying to take a picture of something small or a long ways away (such as wildlife) this could be frustrating.3.  Strap is not very sturdy.  I put this last as I don't usually consider this as a significant factor in my decision making process.  However, it would be better if it were more sturdy.In all, I would definitely recommend this camera for the \"pros\" expressed above.  I wish I could give 4.5 stars for the battery life, but it is worked around so easily I don't want to lower its review a full star for something like that. The batteries are small and easy to carry (I could fit 5-10 in my pocket and barely notice.  The \"cons\" are easily accomodated and it did its expressed job very well.

This camera is small and very easy to keep in your hand. The features are numerous, but as an afterthought, I could have skipped the GPS and purchased the cheaper model. The reasons why I purchased it are: weatherproofness, uses a common battery type, picture quality in a small package, a mistaken idea that my pictures would geo-tagged, and very easy macro shots.  It did most of these things. It does come with a nylon strap with an attached carbiner. It is pretty useless. What it does need is a good wrist strap. I can't imagine anyone using the carbiner to attach the camera to a daypack, your belt, or anywhere that exposes it to bumps and scrapes.I do not want to lose this camera in my travels, in bad weather, or rough conditions. You get this strap and a faux and 'outdoorsy' carbiner and no way to hang on to your camera. What were they thinking?Now the sad news. After spending some time in Ireland I discovered that a lot of my shots were blurry. After a lot of observation I found that the camera was having an issue of internal fogging. The lens was fogging, so was the front and rear LCD displays. It would not happen all of the time but just enough to ruin most of the photos. What pictures that did come out were outstanding. No need for color or exposure correction, just cropping. The macro shot detail was very impressive.The camera was never submerged in water, only to a light rain. So my regrets are that, I should have waited for the product to mature and that I had to pay a lot more than the camera goes for now.I have sent this unit back to the designated Pentax repair center, since it is still very early in its warranty period. Good luck with feedback from Pentax. Luckily I sent it by Priority Mail with delivery confrmation. They received the unit on Sept. 19th and did not send any acknowledgement. It's been over a month and still no communication, still no camera. This is unacceptable. Sure, it is a mid-range product, but it did cost me money. Their profit may have not been much, but they made it, they marketed it, and they came up short.UPDATE: Here it is November 18th and I just received the replacement camera. I started to use it right away. I am still impressed by its color balance, picture detail, ease of use and just plain darn great photos. It still came with the silly nylon strap. But so far so good.

Besides, with plenty of sunshine, a fast lens isn't going to do a whole lot more for you anyway. This camera literally spends two hours a day being dragged the water around on a flotation strap, and I'm not very careful whether it gets dunked, either.

I wanted pictures of what the area used to look like because 10 years from now it will only be a memory otherwise.  This camera offers a built in intervalometer and GPS, which allowed me to mount it to a car taking a picture every 10 seconds and have GPS coordinates recorded to know exactly where that picture was taken.  There is simply no other point and shoot on the market that allows interval timed pictures down to 10 seconds and records GPS, period.  The WG-3 is essentially a GoPro for photographers.  I own a GoPro Hero 3+black but exclusively use that for video since it sucks on image mode.  GoPro images in the highest quality are extremely wide angle fisheye looking and I hate them, and there is no optical zoom so distant objects are not very clear.  I will not be reviewing the video quality on the WG-3 because I do not use it and do not care about it, that's why I own the GoPro.  I had always viewed at Pentax/Ricoh as cheap cameras but my opinion has completely changed now from owning this camera, here is why.Pros:Image quality - Compared to my Panasonic ZS15 image quality from the WG-3 is very good but things like foliage are clearer when cropping images from the ZS15.  With minor adjustments in the saturation, sharpness, etc I have been able to get close to the same coloration the ZS15 provides in Vivid mode and the WG-3 is perfectly capable of taking good landscape photos.  The Panasonic is still going to be the camera I carry for hiking or other activities because of the superzoom lens but you could use the WG-3 as your only camera if you do not need a longer zoom.Built in interval timer - This is critically important to me and something few professional reviewers of this camera fail to even mention.  Ricoh is the only manufacturer that includes this functionality on their point and shoot cameras with the capability to go as short as 10 seconds between shots.  I plan to use this heavily for time lapse photos of landscapes and since the camera is ruggedized it also allows me to place the camera on top of a moving vehicle without worry about rain or impact destroying it.  Instead of having to pull over and stop the car to take a picture on a scenic drive (think of Red Rock Canyon scenic loop in Las Vegas for instance) I can just set it to take a picture every 20 seconds and concentrate on driving.  Pictures of sunsets on a beach are possible without worry of water splashing destroying it, the possibilities are endless.GPS - Important because I wanted to record exactly where the picture was taken, it is very accurate when viewed on Google Maps or compared to my Delorme GPS.Can purchase a remote - This is important to me because I like the ability to take photos with a remote control.  Other cameras on the market like the Panasonic ZS30 force you to use a smart phone as a remote and do not offer separate remote controls for purchase.  I am one of the few people who refuses to own a smart phone so the fact that I can buy a remote for this camera is excellent.Plethora of shooting modes available - Just about any shooting mode you can think of is built into the camera.  One of my favorites is the digital microscope mode where you can literally lay the camera directly onto what you are photographing with the included macro stand and there are LED lights around the lens that allow close up photographs from 1cm away.Mounts - I have been using an off brand suction cup tripod mount with this camera but Ricoh recently announced that they will be selling GoPro type mounts for the WG camera within the next month.  They are going to offer a handlebar mount, suction cup, and adhesive mounts, although due to the high announced cost I will probably just stay with my off brand.Cons:Really I have just one con.  You cannot adjust the shutter speed on this camera for pictures of moving water or at night.  There is a night mode that works fine but it adjust the shutter speed for you instead of giving control.  The newly released WG-4 model does allow shutter speed control but it does not allow it in the interval shooting mode (which could be used for time lapse images of stars at night).  If the WG-4 offered shutter control in the interval shooting mode I would recommend that camera instead and upgrade.  Since the cost of the WG-3 GPS is currently around $200 while the WG-4 GPS is almost $400 I definitely recommend getting the WG-3 GPS and saving a substantial amount of money.Update - I recently dropped this camera down a dry waterfall by accident and it hit multiple boulders on the way down to a stop 20+ feet below.

Fenichel", "ReviewID": "R1R8SEUYWYT75E", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I got a bit of flack (among pros and Swiss Army Knife devotees) but I stand behind this even more so after some extreme and diverse use. I compare it to a 20-tool Swiss Army Knife because it is just packed with useful tools, plus it's a near go-anywhere camera which *can* capture some amazing things. I played around with it a bit (in the city, where I needed to find a park to set the GPS, and practiced micro/macro on the spring tulips) and then went off to some extreme adventure, where I would destroy either a DSLR or myself (like in the water, in rough seas on a small boat, on a mule, in awesome spots where another camera batteries were kaput, and this went into play as a backup).So many modes. Auto-everything is fine, or Program which lets you set lighting and focus modes (including the uniquely Pentax \"microscope mode\" which lights up a ring of light to capture a leaf or coin, etc.). I'd been relying on it for an easy-use camera for underwater or on-mule, and finally ran into 3 people with this camera (in the South Pacific), all happy with it. Photographers and camera buffs tend to comment on how it's the only one with the lens dead center, so you can hold it in front of you, as in snorkeling or holding it still with both hands). It's durable. The waterproofing is excellent. I'd just been focused (sic) on underwater, or in pouring water at sea or in a rainforest, or getting panorama views, using the stitch mode or in the panorama focus mode using video (\"infinity\"), to limit lens noise - the sound of zooming, I mean.I met a pro photographer who looked at this with curiosity and zoomed in quickly to the HDR mode, which I hadn't even thought about. Next day I went off to a scenic beach at dusk and gave it a try. Some wow results. (And GPS-tagged, too.) Not every capture is a winner of course, and it's hard to tell in the small-ish monitor at times. But it comes up with some surprises in terms of great videos. I video'd an erupting volcano from the ocean on a wet and hard-rocking boat, and the video is pretty amazing; couldn't have been done and survived by an expensive DSLR or Videocam - though maybe a GoPro would.On the down side, I got lots of 'grainy' shots in moderate or low light, though some good ones too. It's optical zoom range is limited, and it is, or can be a bit 'noisy' when in dim light and/or zoomed in using digital zoom. On the other hand, I got some very nice flower shots, using the flower mode or not, and some great scenics. It has prompts for night and sky shots (even saying it might be better to do with a tripod), underwater video, macro video... I'm still finding new modes and combinations. I saw some nice 'bokeh' in the floral shots, but with such a small lens I'm thinking it's 1/2 optical, 1/2 software which does the focus distribution.So for me, it's a great 'toolbox', not (except in  some extreme cases) the only camera I used, but one which could go places few other cameras can, with some nice modes to play with if that's your thing. I think the HDR is something I'll play with more, though the results were variable. (Partly me, I'm sure.)I had no problems at all, at home or on an extreme photo expedition. I do suggest a floatable wrist band (rather than the caribiner attachment which comes with it) if you envision a lot of in-water use. And spare batteries. I returned home with unused cards (the SD you can pop out and put directly into many computers/devices) but I really went through 2-3 batteries in a 1/2 day sometimes (especially doing videos), so I'd stock up, and get an external charger.I'd say give it a look, don't expect DSLR results, but do expect some interesting tools plus some surprising things you can do creatively.

The Casio had a nice 10x optical zoom, but alas, that too had proved vulnerable to my clumsiness, requiring a couple of repairs over the years.  So:  I wanted a camera that was waterproof, rugged, easy to use, would take decent pictures, fit in my pocket, and tell me where I was at the time of the shot.

I've had the camera for a couple of months and several thousand photos now and it gets the 5 stars because it does those six things as well as I could hope for.  It fits in my front pants pocket with the lanyard sticking out so I can grab it with gloved hands easily.  The battery generally gets me through the days (you do need a spare one:  they charge in a few hours.)

You can charge the battery in the camera, but you won't want to.  Much easier to use a separate charger and swap out batteries.  The internal memory has enough capacity to be useful on those days you forget to stick a memory card in (again, easier to have a spare).

I tried using some wall plug-ins for USB that I already had laying around the house.  They did not work for this camera.  I finally used the wall charger provided and the camera charged.  Now, not sure if the USB cable will charge the camera if plugged into the car USB port (as an example).  Lastly, the lens crystal/cover is pretty open to the elements.  It's a little concerning that it could be easliy scratched.  But no evidence of such so far.  The last comment is that this camera has a little bit of zoom, but nothing to brag about.  I bought it with a no-zoom thought in mind.  Anyway, it appears to be a fun and usable camera.

The physical design is amazing. Tough but grippy to hold. The lens lets in so much light and takes great underwater photos. The screen is big and easily used. I have two issues with this camera:1 - The menu system feels clunky and below par for a camera like this. Pixel-y icons and slightly difficult to use. I had to read the manual to use this properly. It does work well, I was just hoping for a better interface.2 - the memory card and battery cover could use a better locking mechanism. It does not leak, it works well, but to open it all you do is pull one tab down and another tab across and it opens.

We got this unit before our trip to Punta Cana (Dominican Republic) and the camera performed brilliantly, allowing kids to enjoy underwater (both pool and ocean) shots and videos. I like Pentax as a brand (I am a happy owner of a Pentax K-x DSLR), so my affinity with the brand might have played a role preferring this over other similar cameras but so far I am very happy with my purchase and this equipment also passed the durability/performance test in my kids' hands. What is more, it is a nice photography tool that supports features like Microscopy Mode (i.e. super Macro) which you place the camera on top of the subject (there is a special lens holder provided in the box for this mode) and take extreme close-ups of objects of interest, slow-motion video, panoramic stills, etc.. If you or your young kids are into such experimental photography, this is a great equipment to have.I have been happy with image and video quality. I will not go into the details of how nice, crisp, accurate, etc.. picture quality is, simply it provides enough image quality to satisfy most users out there.One issue I observed with this unit was during the re-charge of the battery. Re-charging of the provided re-chargeable battery is done with the provided USB-cable and the power adaptor. When I first plugged in the USB cable, the green light on the ON/OFF switch did NOT start blinking (to indicate successful re-charging process). I was afraid that there was sth wrong with the camera or battery but after shuffling the cable, unplugging and plugging back it in, the green light started to blink as expected and the battery charged as expected. Similar thing happened in subsequent battery chargings but it is always resolved like above, so it looks like loose connection somewhere on the path which is easily fixable.In summary, if you need a relatively cheap and tough camera (i.e. water-proof, shock-proof, etc..) this unit is certainly worth considering and recommended.", "Date": "January 21, 2014"}, {"Title": "Not working camera", "Author": "SERGIO NEUSPILLER", "ReviewID": "R5DCNNCX9L2HA", "Overall": "1.0", "Content": "I bought it for a trip to Galapagos.Once start using it I found the camera was not working fine.

I attempted to use it a few times that day, trying different things, making sure the camera was not hot when I put it in the water, keeping it at water level, nothing worked. The screen was fogged the whole time rendering the camera useless because you can't see what you are shooting. I returned the camera and got my money back. I have an old Canon with an underwater case, while it doesn't take as clear a photo on land, at least I can see what I'm shooting underwater. If you are using this only for land pics, it's a nice camera, underwater, not so much.

I like it but it's fairly bulky, ugly and picture quality isn't the best. However It does have a lot of features that I just couldn't leave it for the Pentax.First thing I thought when I opened this box was, that this thing was MUCH larger than I thought. From the photos I had assumed it was a decently small camera (my fault for not looking further obviously) but this camera is really thick, and wide, just not really tall. It feels pretty good in the hands though, and I like the original design, and flare on it.Next i went on the the controls, this is one of the disappointments. Most other cameras give you a dial to quickly select modes, this you only have the option of going to a giant menu of all shooting modes and selecting from them, and when you select a special movie mode, you have to switch off it to take pictures again from what I saw. This is just not intuitive and gave me a bad taste.Camera operation was fairly speedy though, sometimes I had to double press the buttons (really have to give them a good push) and it didn't lag much. Taking pictures auto focused really quick, and startup was really quick too.Another thing I didn't like was the zoom, I understand the lack of zoom with the internal lense, I would like to see 5x like competitors but 4x isn't bad. The bad part is it doesn't include really any \"SR\" zoom like other companies. This lets you do a further zoom and the camera takes a larger pictures and crops it down allowing you to lose very little image quality. My olympus does 5x normal and 10x SR zoom.Features are pretty plentiful, i really really like what they did with the LED's, it helps taking certain types of pictures and is just a cool feature to have. Plenty of shooting modes, and it ever has 120fps video in 720p which is a feature I love to have.Overall, if the camera were less bulky, had better zoom function and button configuration I would really love it. however I would not really recommend unless it's features like the LED's or it's design are a must have.", "Date": "March 11, 2014"}, {"Title": "Worked Great!", "Author": "M.

The new one is larger and heavier, but still fits in my pants front pocket where it is handy. A major improvement is the double latch on the battery/SD card door. We handed the camera to a number of people on the trail so that they could take our picture, and every one of them marveled and remarked about the camera.

Back at home I carry the camera to events where I am responsible for social media photos. I prefer using this camera to my Galaxy S4 because this camera is ready to go instantly and is much easier to hold. It is also less trouble to slip out the SD card for loading the photos into the computer than using the phone's cloud or cable-based solutions.

Bauman \"bauman171\"", "ReviewID": "R1DK13RNP8P2ND", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I purchased this camera because I saw it on GMA Deals & Steals, promoted as being \"adventure-prove\" and (of specific interest to me) waterproof to 45 feet with a rechargeable battery.  I had been looking for a waterproof casing for my Canon Rebel T2i for when I go SCUBA diving.  Casings runs around $1,500, so the price tag on this camera (about 1/6 of the price of the casing) appealed to me as well as its versatility and compactness.Although I have not yet had an opportunity to take this camera SCUBA diving (and therefore test it's waterproof-ness), I have spent the last 2 months using it hiking and rafting in Glacier National Park, and so far I am very happy with this camera.First, it is very easy to use.  Anyone with any knowledge of a basic P&S; digital camera can pick this up and use it without reading the instructions, and it has all the standard camera settings for portraits, landscapes, moving subjects, etc.  But beyond that, even when choosing settings, the icon are accompanied by a brief description of what that setting does (ie, flowers with the outline of the flower softened, low light settings, movies, capturing images under water, taking underwater movie, stitches images to create a panoramic photograph, etc).The pictures are also pretty impressive; the camera is much more compact than my DSLR, and although zooming in closely on a moving object can take a bit more time than it does with my DSLR, but the pictures are very close in quality.  And the Pentax WG3 comes with a carabiner and strap so that I can easily attach the camera to my backpack.  Once I tried the image stitch for panoramic pictures, that became one of my favorite settings for out here at the park (you take the first picture and then a small portion of one end of that picture appears in shadow so that you can match that up to the get the next picture to line up with the first).One thing I would recommend would be to get a screen protector.  I meant to find one before I left on my trip but I forgot.  And while I will say that this camera has thus far been tough enough to withstand everything I have put it through, I have- on many occasions- forgotten that it was attached to the chest strap on my pack and when I take off my pack and lean it again a rock or a tree, I forget to protect the camera from slamming into the ground (or rock or tree).  Although the screen is still intact, it is starting to get a few little scratches in it and I intend to get a screen protector as soon as I get home, to protect it from further damage.The only other things I would recommend would be to consider purchasing a float wrist strap (the camera does not float!) and a backup battery.  Although the battery typically lasts me more than a full day of taking pictures, I did get a back up to take backpacking so that I don't have to worry about running out of juice and missing out on some AMAZING pictures!", "Date": "August 1, 2013"}, {"Title": "This camera is awesome!", "Author": "outdoorsman1789", "ReviewID": "R1NX2WHU4BWPAE", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I am a semi-pro photographer with DSLR's and P&S;'s.  This camera is amazing.  I take tons of pictures every day and I would rank this as one of the best point and shoot cameras I have ever used.  It is very fast and you can't compare to 5x optical in body for this price.  The photo quality far succeeded my expectation.  This little camera records in extremely good quality.  The slowmo feature is incredible.  The time laps works perfectly.  The Macro mode is stunning.  Underwater mode is incredible.  Every single feature is great.  Many people complain about the noise when you zoom.  It is loud... but its an in body zoom......... how could it not be loud?  This is a negligible flaw to me because I put music over every second of footage that I take.  All of the settings do what they sat they will do.  I only have 1 complaint, and that is that the screen gets scratched extremely easily.  Now, I know this is a rugged camera and it is put into positions that other cameras would not be in and that is mostly at fault.  I HIGHLY RECOMMEND THAT YOU USE A SCREEN PROTECTOR.  I take VERY good care of my equipment and yet somehow this screen still managed to get scratched pretty badly.  I did't remove a star because that is what this camera is made for- getting abused.  It takes it very well. If you are considering a durable/underwater/everyday camera- BUY THIS PENTAX!", "Date": "July 30, 2013"}, {"Title": "Great Camera, Love it.", "Author": "Richard E.

It supposedly rained a lot and I didn't want to ruin my SLR camera.  However it never rained the entire trip.  I did use the camera a lot however.  The telephoto is really nice and I used that instead of having to put my telephoto lens on the SLR or I would use it when the telephoto lens was on the SLR.  Most of the pictures came out the way I wanted them to.  Some of the shots of snow and/or glaciers came out too bright.  I should have tried the option for snow I guess.  I did try several of the options but usually just stayed with the program  option.  One issue I do have is that the button to zoom in is very close to the movie button.  Sometimes when I was framing a shot and wanted to zoom in some, I pushed the movie button instead and got an unwanted movie.  It does take very nice movies.  I used it instead of lugging my video camera around too.  It is a bit larger and heavier than some cameras but it fits in a lot of my pockets.  It is nice to have around when the grandbabies are around so I don't need to worry about it getting broken.  Before I wrote this review I did take it into the pool and took some underwater movies and still shots.  They came out nicely. The only other issue I have is that though it zooms in a lot, it you go too far the photos lose clarity.

I went with this choice without GPS because I generally know where the shot was taken and can add it to the EXIF data if needed.  I went with the orange thinking the color would be easily spotted if dropped.The packaging is compact but protective.  The number of items is somewhat minimal: camera, power adapter, USB cord, battery, software and the manual.  I added a 8 GB class 10 SD card to hold what turns out to be a lot of shots (over 800 at highest resolution).  I also purchased  a charger and battery (Wasabi Power Battery (2-Pack) and Charger http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B004W82GP8/ref=oh_details_o04_s00_i02?ie=UTF8&psc;=1) because another reviewer mentioned the battery doesn't last long enough for a full day of shooting.I charged the battery using the power adapter/cord, plugged into the camera - worked fine.  After closing the battery/SD Card door and locking it, I started shooting.  The pictures are of good quality although stored only in JPEG (no DNG, no RAW, bummer). I found that I needed to have the manual next to me for the first session because the menu choices are varied (auto, manual, HDR, night, portrait, landscape, etc., etc with or without flast, red eye reduction, facial recognition etc., etc. using single point or broader focus, and exposure).  I am generally a manual or Tv or Av kinda guy with single point focus.  Anyway, I've taken about 200 shots with it so far and I'm impressed.The shots are sharp, the optical zoom works reasonably quickly, autofocus is reasonably fast.  The camera works well in low light conditions using auto ISO (another menu fuction!).  It takes nice macro pictures as well.  The menus, although occasionally obtuse, allow a wealth of shooting options which the photog in me loves.Some things to think about: the camera will sink - use a buoy wrist strap if you're concerned (sailing/kayaking - I'm concerned).  The color is only on the front so if it sinks and falls on it's front in lake muck, good luck finding it (see the buoy above).  Remember to keep the lens (cover? filter? whatever - the clear thing in front of the lens) clean as it is integral to the case - unlike other P/S cameras, there is no automatic lens cover that closes when turned off.  If it gets wet, you will have spots until it's cleaned.Disclaimer:  I shoot Pentax DSLRs.  I generally have to protect the lens/bodies with my body in inclement weather/people.  I am familiar with Pentax software but don't use it - I use Adobe Lightroom for import, organization, initial editing and publishing and Adobe Photoshop Elements and the GIMP for tweaking and detailed editing.  I purchased this camera because I am very familiar with the way Pentax organizes the menus, the WG-2 won at TIPA and outdoor magazines all give it a thumps up/best choice/it survived.", "Date": "May 29, 2013"}, {"Title": "Great in Water", "Author": "Brandon Wacasey", "ReviewID": "R1OHPIYFTBCST5", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "Maybe not the best picture quality, but everything about it is convenient.

A shame because the features on this camera were fantastic.  When I say underwater, I mean snorkeling...it was never at any sort of depth and to be honest, it was in the water for maybe one hour.  I returned the camera but likes the features so much I have just ordered the WG3 and I hope it gets a better review than this.Update June 19. ..this version three is AMAZING.  No water leakage issues...it works even better above ground.  I do not like the underwater setting on this or any other camera, but the visibility thanks to the large view finder is great!  The photos are great!  The speed is fantastic under most circumstances....even with it the GPS I found the battery life very good, and the settings very close to the settings since the first generation which made this a snap for me.I am thrilled with the improvements on this 3rd generation ..purple..and yup, it's at attention getter.  My only advice..if you are going to use it in the water, get a floating strap, This thing is heavy , but in a good way because it's so rugged!  What an improvement from the 2nd generation!", "Date": "May 28, 2013"}, {"Title": "Pentax", "Author": "Venyamin Fradlin", "ReviewID": "R1JK2LKRZRFDAH", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "It wass good as long as it last.

I am compelled to write this because of my great disappointment in the camera's performance.Within 5 minute on opening the Pentax WG-3 GPS, I had reboxed it and looked into the amazon return process at no fault of the seller or Amazon. Cameta Camera shipped it fast.First issue I noticed was that the focus cycled full range at every shot making the click to shot acquisition time excessive (1-2s).  This will not work for action shots or taking shots with children.  Even though the subject was in focus or very close to focus in the viewfinder, however, the camera lens mechanism would go through its full cycle from end to end trying to focus.  That is not acceptable in today's camera technology.  My cheap smart phone focus and shoot faster than this camera, which is not saying a lot.The few images I took in the few auto modes yielded grainy images with dull colors. My 6 year old cheap point and shoot Sony had better image quality and shot faster.I really had high hopes for this camera because of the F2.0 lens, QI charging option, and other great features.  I think I will wait and revisit the Olympus TG-2 or the Nikon AW 110.", "Date": "April 1, 2013"}, {"Title": "Never got to try it", "Author": "Holly Suitor", "ReviewID": "R22GFV5B3YE6T3", "Overall": "1.0", "Content": "not sure where the problem was but the camera didn't charge -- it could have just been a bad battery but didn't have the time to figure it out.", "Date": "June 30, 2013"}, {"Title": "NOT GPS unit", "Author": "TEH \"tehschhi\"", "ReviewID": "R15CN4X3A6LS0C", "Overall": "3.0", "Content": "This camera is easily confused with identical Pentad Optio's because the model number is the same (WG-3), but this one does not have GPS.
