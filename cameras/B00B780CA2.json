I took mine to North Carolina in some serious backwoods , got it dirty, wet, etc. works fine. Get it off Amazon and you will receive a bunch of accessories you otherwise would not get in the store. If I could afford another 100 dollars I would get a Go-Pro, but this thing kicks ass for what it is. The video is good and the panoramic picture thing is pretty cool. Great vacation/outdoor/pool party camera.", "Date": "August 18, 2013"}, {"Title": "Great", "Author": "GORDON R CARTER", "ReviewID": "R3JF1N6HTZUY5Z", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "I like Sony products they r very reliable.
