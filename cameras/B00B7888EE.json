{"Reviews": [{"Title": "Great Package", "Author": "Alexis Howell", "ReviewID": "R1ADPFQ52WM462", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I was nervous about getting this package because it seemed too good to be true. The cost was almost the same as just the camera from the Olympus website, yet it came with over a dozen accessories. The camera is probably the best digital camera I have ever purchased. I specifically wanted a camera that could be used underwater and it exceeded my expectations. The pictures come out great and it is so easy to take to the beach, in the pool, hiking, etc.", "Date": "July 29, 2013"}], "ProductInfo": {"Price": "$449.95", "Features": "KIT INCLUDES 11 PRODUCTS -- All BRAND NEW Items with all Manufacturer-supplied Accessories + Full USA Warranties:\n<1> Olympus Tough TG-2 iHS Shock & Waterproof Digital Camera (Black) + <2> PD C190D Digital Camera Case +\n<3> Transcend 32GB Class10 SD Card + <4> Spare Li-90B Battery + <5> Charger for Olympus Li-90B +\n<6> Zeikos 50\" Compact Tripod + <7> Floating Foam Camera Strap + <8> HDMI to Micro-HDMI Cable (6') +\n<9> PD Memory Card Storage Wallet + <10> LCD Monitor Screen Protectors + <11> PD 5pc Complete Cleaning Kit", "Name": "Olympus Tough TG-2 iHS Shock & Waterproof Digital Camera (Black) with 32GB Card + Case + Battery & Charger + Tripod + HDMI Cable + Accessory Kit", "ImgURL": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/51qADRu2PvL._SY300_.jpg", "ProductID": "B00B7888EE"}}
