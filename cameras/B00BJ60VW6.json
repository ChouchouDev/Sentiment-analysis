We wanted the convenient Wifi picture transfer, and got so much more.  She has a Canon Rebel t3 so we wanted something small. It fits easily in your pocket and is very light weight.I LOVE the Samsung Smart Camera app.  It takes this camera from a cheap point in shoot to an amazing device.I cannot say enough good things about the remote view finder.  You can setup your camera and wirelessly view what you look like and hit the picture button on your android phone!Wifi photo transfer is easy and convenient. No more cables, or taking out the memory stick to put into the computer and then forgetting it.Wireless upload!  This camera can link to your phone, and when you take a picture it appears on your phone ready to upload.  You can send good quality photos instead of using the cruddy camera built into your phone.This is a great little camera for a great price. It has some amazing features that are very convenient.

The camera is very small so small it can fit in your back pocket or front. This is not a bad thing actually this is what i wanted it for i needed something small, light weight, and easy to use so when i go to my nerd conventions ill have an easier time taking pictures of everything/one i see.The pictures look really great! they are clear and take way better pictures them my camera phone which again is what i needed. When going on conventions you don't want to use your phones for pictures because your battery will die fast and you need that life so if you get lost from your group you can contact them etc....The WIFI feature is stupid easy to use! I saw some people complain it was so hard and cant figure out....its 3 steps WHICH THE CAMERA EXPLAINS TO YOU!!! yeah you don't even need to open up the instructions....it explains it for you on the camera in 3 very simple easy steps. You download an app on your phone (which BTW was free on my android), you press a button in the app after opening it, and you click for a pick and POP! downloads right onto your phone....my 55 year old mother could figure this out.BTW ladies this phone looked pink to me in all the pictures, but it clearly says red and it is red. Its a very very pretty red, but still red.This thing has amazing zoom for a little guy i was able to take a clear pictures from about 2-3 feet away which isn't half bad. yeah there is better but the thing is crazy small! lolI love the size of the back screen, i show off my pics to my fiance all the time and he likes the fact he can see the screen without coming super close (he is lazy).The buttons are very super clear on what they are and do so again you really don't need to open the instructions unless you have never touched a camera/electronic in your life.It comes with a rechargeable battery and of course a plug to charge it. Its nice because its a USB plug so you can use the USB part for your computer.it has some cool filters that would be fun to use defiantly if you want some fun shots.Yes, the camera has a video feature which is really cool and kinda needed when i see panels so i can record funny things they say.So to wrap it up its small, useful, take great pics, has good features, and mainly would be good for someone who goes to events, outside, parties, even if you have kids, etc....to use. If your looking to be a professional photographer no i wouldn't get it if your like me and just go to a lot of events or parties or like to take funny pictures of your cats then its pretty useful and fun.:) hope this helps!", "Date": "January 9, 2014"}, {"Title": "Great if all you want is an extremely basic camera.", "Author": "S. Williams", "ReviewID": "R3B8AIIACF7PH", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "I give this camera 4 stars  because if all you're looking for is a basic, literally point and shoot camera. Look no further, this may be it.What I was looking for:- something very slim that I could put in my pocket as I do my smartphone- great picture quality- decent optical zoom- HD video recordingIt met and/or exceeded those areas.Pros:- This thing is tiny. Just a tad bit thicker than an iPhone- Great pictures when you have adequate light- Decent flash for low light photos- WIFI + BONUSES. You can read the specs but this one thing is cool so I have to mention. You can install an app on your iPhone or Android device that allows you to use your phones screen as the display for the camera to take pictures. Some may say this is useless, but it basically allows for remote control of the camera. I found it very handy.- Battery lasted an entire day of picture taking at Disney- Can snap pictures of the kids and get a clear shot even when they are not perfectly still.Cons:- Other than the (Smart) auto mode, this camera is seriously lacking in advanced manual controls. You can't change the aperture and such. You can change the shutter speed in a \"Night\" mode, but the lowest you can do it is 1 second. I understand in night you may want a longer shutter delay, but what if I wanted the shutter to operate faster? No dice.- Menu navigation isn't ideal. For a basic camera there shouldn't be a need to access certain features under then home > settings button and option, then have to access similar options under the menu button and sub menus. Options are too scattered.- Low light pictures are not great without flash. I compared this to my iPhone 4 and iPhone 5 and in every situation the iPhone 5 out performed it.- Continuing on with the feedback about shutter speed. Pictures can easily get blurred if say you were on a slow moving ride or tour and trying to snap a picture. Anti shake didn't help with that.I returned it mainly for the limited manual controls. I'm not a basic user. If you are happy not changing the settings and don't take picture while in any kind of motion you'll be happy and it does give you good pictures.I mainly want a DSLR and something small and expensive to compliment it when I travel light on a day to day. I returned it as it doesn't work for me, but I still think it's a great camera for many. It was $99 when I got it at best buy, it was also $99 on Amazon at the time. At the moment it's $84 on Amazon. As the price decreases this camera becomes more and more attractive.", "Date": "July 15, 2013"}, {"Title": "For $90, This is a BEST BUY for a tiny WiFi camera...", "Author": "Bears Fan Jim \"qm2-703\"", "ReviewID": "RUNVZ5GI3F0Y2", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "First, I would advise you to read the reviews of Tristero, S.Williams, D.Shannon, and B. Valdez....I would sign my own name to those comments.But as with ANY camera, you just can't stop blur if your camera is shooting at 1/30th of a second or slower, and even with a fast f2.5 lens rating, in low light you will be at 1/30th or slower a lot of the time.My wife thinks 5X zoom is plenty for her Interior Design and Real Estate practice, and for family events. She really likes the ablility to share immediately with other relatives who have smartphones with less capable photo quality. Our son got WiFi and smart remote apps to work quite well, in about 20 mins, connecting to a Samsung cellphone and an HTC cellphone.A note about zoom in any tiny camera: Since the lens is so small, there is a real challenge to get high resolution, no matter how many megapixels or what the specs say. It is much better to zoom in for a shot, rather than take the wider shot and try to magnify on the PC later. Actually, this is true of any camera, even my Canon SX40 !!!The ST150F is capable of capturing restaurant shots, family get-togethers, infant photos,etc. It is much smaller, and I believe better built, than the Elph 115 I also looked at before buying the Samsung.If 5X zoom is all you need, you only use a camera in its Auto mode, and you want the tiniest, absolutely \"any-shirt-pocket\" camera, and you want WiFi plus remote control, this is right there near the top of the class under $150.", "Date": "September 2, 2013"}, {"Title": "Love this camera!", "Author": "MICHELLE \"Booksprite\"", "ReviewID": "R100LNA2XTNEWH", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "Lightweight, compact, and attractive, this camera even has a 'smile' detector!

User documentation is sparse and lacking. However, I consider myself fairly technical savvy. I own a number of electronics far more complex than a digital point and shoot camera. I struggled with connected the camera to our Wifi network in that you would enter the Wifi password and select \"done\" however nothing would happen.. After several attempts, I contacted Samsung support via chat. The guy via chat was very inept. I then phoned in. It was difficult to reach the right department since there is no option for digital cameras. I choose \"computers\", however even under this option, there was no digital camera selection. I proceeded with laptops, and the person that (quickly) connected transferred to me. After trying several options with this tech, he had me completely remove the battery. This solved the issue, and the camera now accepted the Wifi password. If you run in to the same issue, remove the battery & memory card and wait 10 seconds.Now that this is resolved, backing up photos to our server is easy - click the \"Wifi\" button, then click ok to confirm. Photos back up in a few seconds.battery charger plug:The one I received is for a European or Asian market. The prongs are tilted 30 degrees.

I have a more expensive camera, one with plenty of bells and whistles as well as those extras lens for special types of situations. If I'm looking for professional level photos, that's my first choice. I can get a finer degree of control and more options when it comes to close-ups and distance shots. The colors are more balanced. There are also more settings.But that camera not only has a hefty price tag but it is  also heavy and bulky. So it isn't always the best choice when I'm running out the door and just want some decent shots of wherever I'm going and whatever I'm doing. I might not want to keep those photos forever.The web friendly sharing features are also a plus. Not only can I share photos - and quickly -from home but if I'm near a Wifi connection while away from home (and there are plenty of those around, more and more all the time) I can share pictures as well.The connection to Wifi Is about as seamless as it gets and then you're off and running. Want to quickly put  a photo on Facebook? There's a built-in app for that. Want to let friends and family see a picture quickly? There's an app for that too.  I can even save photos to  Picasa and edit them at my convenience (yes, built-in app for that). All these features are a huge plus.I use this camera for business too. It like the ability to show potential clients some clear and sharp photos of items they might want or to take a quick snapshot of something I might want to purchase. The photos are appealing and the colors are accurate.Bottom line: if you want a nice camera that takes decent shots and also like the ability to easily share photos over Wifi, this is a good choice.

I  wanted to purchase a camera for my mother, who has minimal experience with newer tech.I was hoping to get a point and shoot which took better pictures than the throw away cameras she bought at the store.  I wanted one cable to both charge the camera and transfer pictures and video.  No changing batteries or taking out SD cards to complicate the learning process.I did not care about user controls since this was for my mother with limited experience.  Unfortunately, I am spoiled by my Canon's auto picture capability.  This Samsung ST150F relies heavily on flash when set on auto, and it is easy to get blur in pictures (especially when light is unevenly distributed in the area you are shooting).  The pictures are a little low in contrast.  Additionally, video requires navigating through the menu instead of a dedicated hardware button.  For advanced users not a problem but less than optimal for my purpose.  Last, I could not setup the WiFi (would not accept password) even after updating the firmware and removing the battery.  However, this might be due to the older router at my parents' house.I did not test the advanced settings.  All in all, it serves my purpose for a beginner camera point and shoot with one cable to charge and transfer pics.  Hopefully the WiFi will work when I upgrade their service and equipment this summer.If you are a hobbyist or above, I would recommend another camera.  However, as a gift to someone who is new to taking pictures with digital cameras, there are a lot of features that ease use and connectivity (although that adds to the price).  Plus, it is a small, light, pretty camera, so my mother doesn't have to look like she bought something from Goodwill when she takes it out in front of her friends and does not at weight or bulk to her purse.

When connected to a normal wifi network the camera can upload pictures to various internet sites but it is a manual process. You must take the pictures then put the camera in proper mode to upload the pictures.  You can't be capturing and uploading pictures at the same time.  You can control the camera in view finder mode but that only works with the camera acting as a hotspot with an android or iOS device connecting to it.  Not sure why anyone would want to control a camera with their smart phone unless they like selfies of themselves using their phone to take pictures.  It would be much more useful if it connected to a normal wifi network and then could be controlled from anywhere on the network and when a picture is taken it would automatically upload it like the eye-fi cards do.  If you don't have a computer and want to be able to move the pictures off the camera to your smart phone it works fine for that.  If you have a computer it is easier to just hook it up to  a USB port.

I also wanted to be able to upload what I thought would be many many pictures over wi-fi so I could clear them out at night if necessary.Frankly, I think the camera could use some better documentation, or a user support group or something.I will freely admit that most of my problems are more than likely user-error problems that could be fixed with some patience or instruction or something, but this camera takes lousy pictures.It's not even that the picture quality is bad, it's that when you push the shutter button, NOTHING HAPPENS.  Great moments would slip away before I could make the camera understand that I REALLY wanted to take a picture of whatever was in front of me.  No amount of jiggering with the settings helped:  outside, inside, bright lights, low lights, the camera missed them all because the shutter lag is awful.  I even tried taking pictures of my parents (lazy, motionless, unmotivateable) dog when I got home, and it couldn't adequately capture a sleeping blue heeler.  He was always out of focus.  I must reiterate:  He never moved from his spot on the floor.  If I can't capture a dog that's not moving, there is no hope at all of being able to catch people in costume as they stroll past.  I am willing to take any advice anyone can offer me, and I will be glad to change the rating of this camera if I can get it to take good pictures.  I elected not to take it on vacation this year, as I wanted to actually take pictures, and not get the tail end of something as it goes past.On an unrelated note, the camera is indeed small enough for a small purse or a back pocket.  The size and weight are both very convenient. I didn't try the wi-fi function because I never got any good shots.

It is incredibly thin and a lot smaller than most cameras.  I ordered this from Amazon Warehouse Deals and came early, so I quickly started it up.  It was very easy to set up, and with a few tweaks I had the camera set to just how I wanted it in no time flat.  Then (of course) I gave it a test run.  I set it to \"Smart Camera Mode\" which lets the device decide if it is a close up, far away pic, etc.  I took a picture of my bedroom with it with no tripod or anything, and, I must say, it came out crystal clear.  I used to have an old Kodak Easyshare 5.0mp given to me, and it took pretty grainy pictures even at its top quality setting.  This blows it away.  I also tried taking pictures of things far away and even with the subject far away, it STILL had the sharpest of details.  I haven't fully tested the video recording yet, but it still seems promising.  And sharing is easy.  It did take a minute to figure it all out, (I refuse to read directions for this stuff.  I like figuring it out myself.) but once I did, it was incredibly easy to attach pictures on Facebook, email, and all kinds of stuff.  Plus, the Moble Link and Remote Viewfinder are a very nice touch.  I really like the fact that you can see yourself when you want to take a picture AND tell the camera when you want to take it.

Burke", "ReviewID": "R2N7DRMAKF4WD8", "Overall": "3.0", "Content": "The camera itself takes great pics, at least compared to what I had before, however the wi-fi features leave much to be desired and if you are an Ubuntu user you are somewhat out of luck.Firstly the camera arrived asking for a firmware update. To update the firmware you need to install a Windows or Mac only program on your computer which is stored in the memory of the camera. I attempted to install the app using Wine but it errored out stating that i-launcher could not be found. After much searching it appears the only way to get the app is to have Samsung send it to you, it can not be downloaded from their site. So I called tech support asking for a copy of the file and spoke to someone who never heard of linux who told me he would have to escalate the issue and have a senior tech call me back. That was 5 days ago, no one ever called back.Next are the Wi-Fi apps that come on the phone, you have FaceBook, Picasa, YouTube, and Microsoft SkyDrive.Submitting pictures to FaceBook was simple, however I had to occasionally log into facebook to confirm that I really wanted to 'allow' the pictures from my PC.Picasa is a Google product and is unsupported by my operating system.For YouTube videos (and Facebook videos) your video must be in 300x200 format and less than 30 seconds in length for the camera to upload it, which makes it fairly useless.Skydrive ironically was the most Ubuntu friendly of the apps, however it only lets you upload 6 pics at a time at max resolution and was painfully slow.Backing up to PC over WiFi is apparently impossible on Ubuntu due to the needed software not being able to be installed. Using the cable works fine, however the included USB cable is about 8 inches long so be prepared to dangle your camera from your PC while transferring files unless you have a longer cord handy.On to the menu system... it can be extremely confusing. You alternate between the Trashcan and Menu to go back a level. Hitting Menu takes you to the menu for what you are currently doing (movie, camera), the Home button takes you to a set of different menus (Wi-Fi, scene selection, etc), and the Wi-Fi button takes you to a 3rd set of menus. Its about as clear as mud.This camera also has DLNA so it can talk to my DVD player over my home wireless network, which I thought was very cool, however when accessing the camera thru my bluray player if I try to load the images folder it says 'no supported files found' and when I go to the video folder it will play, but streaming is very choppy (play for 3 seconds, stop for 2, repeat). Maybe at 300x200 it would play fine, but who wants to shoot video at that level?Overall its a 3 star camera based on price and image quality, but the WiFi features are extremely lacking and not worth the extra cost.UPDATE: I found a workaround for the Facebook issue where I had to approve all pics manually from a PC when submitting them thru the camera. If you email the pictures to your Facebook posting email address then the pics will show on your timeline without requiring approval. Using the FaceBook tool will require manual approval after the 5th picture in each new album. So you can either make a new album for every 5th picture or email them.", "Date": "February 10, 2014"}, {"Title": "5 star day shots, 1 star night shots.", "Author": "G.

Not much in there.\" The contents were: 1 camera, 1 micro USB cable and 1 A/C USB plug. Frankly, I don't even recall seeing a warranty statement card or quick start guide. There definitely wasn't any kind of manual or software disk. No strap. No memory card. No A/C battery charger (to charge the battery you must have the battery inside the camera and connect the camera to the USB cable; a A/C USB adapter is included).Initial battery charging took about four or five hours. I surely hope this is not going to be the case every time I must recharge. Like with most electronic devices, upon first power-up you are walked through the initialization process. I didn't find the setup commands and menu to be terribly intuitive. This was complicated by the lack of documentation. I consider myself to be very tech savvy. I have been a professional software engineer and spent 20 years running a technology consulting company, and I would say the initialization process was just a bit more cumbersome than I would have preferred. In fact, my dad would likely have just given up on the setup.After initial setup, of course the first thing I had to do was actually take a picture. I have to say, I found it pretty amusing that Samsung equipped this model with enough built-in memory to take exactly ONE picture before the \"Memory Full\" message appears. Yup, I forgot to insert my MicroSD card. I guess I don't really realize just how tiny a MicroSD card is until I have to actually handle one. Sure, I jammed one into my phone when I first got it, but that's one of those things you do once and forget. With a camera, there is a high probability that I'll be swapping out memory cards on a frequent basis and will find my heavily callused sausages for fingers to be a challenge when dealing with such a small card. Of course storage of spare memory cards is a mixed blessing as well. Small and compact, easy to store and transport, but just as easy to misplace, drop and lose while handling.After playing with the camera for the last few days I think I have enough pros and cons to post a useful review, but will edit as my experience with features grows.Pros:Very compact size fits perfectly in a shirt pocket.Giant 3\" LCD display is a nice feature on such a compact cameraVery feature-rich with tons of \"fun\" extras in both pic and video modeSo far, battery life seems quite adequateIn-camera battery charging with micro-USB cable means it's compatible with most modern cell phone chargers (including car chargers) - Major convenience when travelingCons:Cumbersome menu system with NO touch screen input will take some time to become comfortable with interfaceNo dedicated video/pic mode button; requires using the cumbersome interface mentioned above to switch modesPlastic camera housing has a very inexpensive feel and likely won't wear well with extended handlingTripod mount (threaded socket) on bottom of camera is plastic; I'm worried about it's durability over time\"Smart Mode\" in both pic and video modes resulted in low quality images when shooting indoors at night; outdoors in daylight worked very  wellMP4 video format is not compatible with Windows Movie Maker without third-party CODECNo \"pause\" feature when recording video; useful when recording instructables, etc.Summary:After my limited use, I'm not ready to send it back just yet. As mentioned above, I purchased from a different source for a somewhat lower price, so I'm feeling like I got a pretty good value. Had I paid the $85 Amazon price I'd be on the fence and have to spend time scrutinizing pic and video quality and features before deciding to keep this one. MicroSD card and no external battery charger included would have me considering some other options in this price range (perhaps the Canon A2300?)", "Date": "October 8, 2013"}, {"Title": "Amazing Camera", "Author": "Lanceshield", "ReviewID": "RUBI80UGEDSW6", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "Can't say enough about how pleased I am with every aspect of this camera.

But............  Even I was able to link this camera to my Samsung S3 phone so than when I take a picture with the camera, it's sends a copy to the phone.  My phones whistles at or to me so I know it's received.  How cool is that?  The photos are excellent and the price was probably a mistake.  I had placed it in my cart or \"saved for later\" list and I checked and saw the price had gone down $20.  Not hesitating, I bought it.  With prime, I got it super fast.  Here's the funny part:  After buying it, I went back to Amazon; to the same camera page that by then noted I had bought one of these previously and saw where the price was back to the regular +20 number.  Needless to say, it made my day.  SideNOTE: have had PRIME for a few years and I like the current price.  Changed my account from automatic REbilling / invoicing so I can think about this price increase before August gets here.  Maybe if they had more British cop series or more current movies not just for children..... it would make the decision much easier and I would be that Automatic rebill customer again. PRIME is great if they don't price themselves out of customers.", "Date": "April 7, 2014"}, {"Title": "Looks and feels too cheap, you get what you paid for", "Author": "Yadamjav", "ReviewID": "R20AOKQXBPIYZ", "Overall": "2.0", "Content": "It looks too cheap, but for the price i guess okay.

Reality was a different story altogether.First of all, the pictures were marginal - nowhere near as good as the old Nikon this camera was supposed to replace.The wi-fi features were a train wreck from beginning to end. First they were difficult to set up. Complete instructions were not in the box, nor was the required software. Once those hurdles were overcome, I tried to set up the Backup feature. However the camera kept forgetting the network settings and losing the wi-fi connection. Mostly it just said it couldn't see the computer it was supposed to be backing up to. Tried on two different PCs, both with firewalls turned off. I am not a neophyte when it comes to wi-fi devices. There are 10-12 other wi-fi devices on my network (it varies), all of which work flawlessly.The social networking features were no better. Camera would not remember Facebook login OR network settings, so that info had to be re-entered every time. Once entered correctly, it said the server didn't respond.I called Samsung support and got some idiot who kept putting me on hold for no reason, and knew less about the camera than I did.Finally I hung up on him and returned the camera for a refund.", "Date": "December 28, 2013"}, {"Title": "so far its awesome!", "Author": "Amazon Customer", "ReviewID": "RDVWX8CI3HLZ6", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "im loving this camera so far. very small but packed with extras!! i love that it sends pics right to my phone or to my facebook.", "Date": "May 17, 2013"}, {"Title": "Nice but no memeory card.", "Author": "Rhonda Cooper", "ReviewID": "RFXWCYIJE8VUC", "Overall": "3.0", "Content": "We received this product, and we do like it except the memory card has no memory.
