I can't say I've ever used mine on a shoot, but it's there just in case.  Good quality construction, color-coded subject organization, it should last fairly well through normal lite usage.  If you need to refer to this all the time, you should really take the time to learn your camera.

Finding the answer to your question can be a frustrating experience.     The inBrief camera reference card is a laminated, foldable guide that answers most camera operation questions quickly and easily. The information is arranged logically so you can find the answer to you question in the shortest time possible.     Each inBrief card shows an annotated line drawing of the camera and an index to the information on the other panels. If you have a question about white balance, simply look at the purple panel. Answers to custom settings are always on the green panel.     The inBrief card has laminated hinges so the card lies flat. When folded, the dimensions are 5.5 inches by 4.25 inches. It fits neatly in the outside pocket of your camera bag for instant access.     Each card is subdivided into eight subjects across twelve color-coded panels. An overview of the information on each panel is listed below.   Teal: Annotated line drawing and general index Blue: Viewfinder, Control panel, and Monitor displays Red: Camera functions by exposure mode and flash information Lime: Focus, Drive Modes, and Self-Timer Yellow: Exposure, Metering, Bracketing Purple: White Balance, ISO, Image Size / Quality Orange: Displaying Images, Resetting the camera,   Live View Green: Custom Settings \u00a0   Each card is professionally printed on 10 point card stock and laminated on each side for long wear and protection from the elements.
