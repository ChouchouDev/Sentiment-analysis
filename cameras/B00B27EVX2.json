I never knew how much fun it would be to take pictures!  I am an actress and I wanted to have something to capture every moment!  This is wonderful!  I can practice my monologues, record scenes, and do so much with it!  I can't believe what a steal this product is!  I didn't like the camera bag, but I will get a new one soon.  I wish it just came with a small case for protecting the camera when out, instead of a bag.  Love it though!!!!", "Date": "July 22, 2013"}], "ProductInfo": {"Price": null, "Features": null, "Name": null, "ImgURL": null, "ProductID": "B00B27EVX2"}}
