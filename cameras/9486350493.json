Nowhere else is it represented to be a SONY product. And clearly it isn't. Instructions are worthless and there's no illustration. Wrote to the seller. Seller said it didn't need instructions! Well, why did they pretend to include them! Said there's a Youtube video on it. I couldn't find it. Seller's English was as good as those in the alleged instructions. I can't make hide nor hair of this. But it HAS occurred to me that with those two leads coming down and connecting to SOMETHING this doesn't make for a good \"hidden\" camera. A clock this light can probably run off its one little battery for a month. So what are the wires for? Aha.....! Dumb in theory, dumb in execution, Just plain dumb.", "Date": "October 5, 2012"}], "ProductInfo": {"Price": "$90.25", "Features": "Completely covert hidden cameras looks and functions like a regular clock\nCapture hidden camera footage\nNo one will suspect that this completely standard looking wall clock", "Name": "GW Security GWCLK20 420TVL 1/3-Inch Sony CCD Quartz Wall Clock Security Spy Hidden Camera with 3.7mm Wide Angle Lens", "ImgURL": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/41Fx-Lg6FeL._SY300_.jpg", "ProductID": "9486350493"}}
