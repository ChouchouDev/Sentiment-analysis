It has a full frame sensor like the 5D but is less expensive.  I originally wanted the 24-70mm lens, but am much happier with the 24-105.  It's slightly more versatile.  I'm still getting to know the rest of the items in the package, but the camera is a win for sure!", "Date": "June 5, 2013"}, {"Title": "No longer a skeptic.", "Author": "Desdinova", "ReviewID": "RGJ9RSYGHLGYG", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I'll leave out the camera review and mention the seller.  A warehouse store had a 6D kit for $3150.00.  They began a $350 instant rebate for a kit bringing the price down to $2800.00.  The tax was on the $3150.00 price, so the total would have been around $3100.00 anyway.  I began shopping online to find a price lower than $3150.  I saw Davismax ad on Amazon for the $2799 with no tax.  They offered a bunch of other gear in the kit too.  It took me a few days of research to make sure it wasn't a 'too good to be true' deal.  I finally pushed the button to buy.I ordered 2nd day shipping and the box arrived the next day, to my surprise.  I checked the body out and registered it immediately to check for USA new build.  The 3 main lenses were Canon as advertised.  Everything DavisMax advertised was in the box, plus a few more items.  I was impressed with seeing the Canon EW-83H lens hood included.  That\u2019s a $50.00 hood!  I priced everything out individually and used the lower online prices for this review.  The total came to over $3600.00.The tripod was the only lightly constructed item in the kit.  I won\u2019t use it to hold up this body but it works well on a small point and shoot camera.  It\u2019s compact, light, and has it\u2019s own carrying bag.As for the camera review:  Awesome!", "Date": "March 21, 2014"}, {"Title": "Best Canon 6d deal around", "Author": "Jim S", "ReviewID": "R1T0WZQHAGZX2B", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "Dollar for dollar, I paid $2,790 in July, 2013, this was the best price for the Canon 6d and three Canon lenses I found on line.

The shoulder bag less so. It is not sufficiently rigid when laden and when closed still leaves open 'holes' on both sides on top.All in all a solid recommendation though.", "Date": "April 12, 2014"}, {"Title": "snap happy", "Author": "mchelle woodward", "ReviewID": "R21K4T25J1DWXP", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "Best deal online, for a full frame camera this camera takes sharp clear beautiful photos, I am a photographer and bought this camera for its great low light ability's at weddings in a dark church or reception area turn up the iso and get every shot.", "Date": "March 19, 2014"}, {"Title": "Super Quality Camera", "Author": "Prajwal Gupte", "ReviewID": "RM86HPKMK27NZ", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "This is a super quality camera and the bundled package is great.Its very difficult to purchase these items separately and beat the price which the seller is offering.
