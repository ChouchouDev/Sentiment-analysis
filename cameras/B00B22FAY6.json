{"Reviews": [{"Title": "It's a small camera with a REALLY small sensor", "Author": "Jason B. Smith", "ReviewID": "R2SYD2P6K4IHJ", "Overall": "3.0", "Content": "It does the job, more or less.  The quality of the video is mediocre, the night vision (as noted in the specifications) is only good to a couple of feet and you can clearly see the outline of the LEDs.  It doesn't switch between night and day vision automatically, and day vision in less than full light is very very noisy.  The directions are in Japanese and I haven't been able to find an English translation anywhere, but you can kind of figure it out by the pictures.  All that said, it's a TINY camera and it definitely does take decent HD video in full light.  Did I mention it's tiny?  Shipping was quick, especially given where it was coming from, and price was reasonable for what it is.", "Date": "May 22, 2013"}], "ProductInfo": {"Price": null, "Features": null, "Name": "The World's Smallest!
