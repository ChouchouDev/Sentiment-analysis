Wanted to let you know few more things about this camera:Pros:(a) Pics in the day time are sharp and smooth. U won't ask for anything better.(b) Controls are pretty easy to understand. Just go to any photography website and look for what experts have to say about the settings.(c) the camera with 18-55 lens feels very light weight.(d) Fits in your hands just perfectly, and each and every button is at perfect place; be it the exposure controller, flash etc.(e) Liked the cleaning kit, though i did not and will not use the liquid to clean lenses. Liked the small tripod (other than the big one that came with the package), which u can keep on a table and shoot.(f) 32Gb memory card is good to have.(g) 55-300mm lens works great as it is supposed to be.Neutral:(a) 55-300 mm lens is pretty heavy, and it is supposed to be.(b) UV protectors are okay to have.(c) Tripod looks okay to me. I won't be taking it to trekking trips, so i don't care.(d) Extra battery is okay to have. Really didn't feel the need yet.Cons:(a) Camera bag looks cheap and is build quality is not at all good.(b) Watch out for the memory card. Mine went bad in a few days, and then i got it replaced by the seller.(c) Card reader can't get worse. I threw it in the dustbin, the second day.(d) Screen guards are cheap. DO NOT TRY them on ur camera screen.(e) \"Focus DVD\"... I don't know what that is.If you can... look for a deal with camera + 18-55mm lens + 55-300mm lens ONLY. Rest all is crap. I gave a 5 star only for the camera, nothing else.----------------------------------------August 25th '13----------------------------------------I am an amateur at digital photography and this is the first time i bought a DSLR. I had been to Best Buy and the salesperson there gave me detailed insights into 3 digital cameras... The Nikon D5200, Canon (forgot the model) and the Sony Nex. He said that he personally feels that the Nikon is the best of the 3 with lot more options and things to learn as an amateur and ease of use. Then I went to Ken Rockwell's website ([...] to see his comments and he says that D5200 is the best entry (+) level DSLR currently in the market, and after few discussions with my colleagues and friends I had come to a conclusion that I am gonna go for it. I ordered a D5200 on Amazon to be fulfilled by 47th Street Photo. I was gravely disappointed not at the camera but at 47th Street Photo, since they delivered me a camera with no US warranty, supposed to be sold in some other country. I got a replacement with 7-8 days though.Ken Rockwell, suggested few camera settings for low light (to increase the ISO sensitivity) and few more here and there, using which i got really awesome sharp shots. I personally feel, that this is an awesome camera for beginners.NB: Do not forget to check the warranty of the electronic item you buy. The sellers sometimes ship items without any warranty and supposedly to be sold in some other country, because they get them dirt cheap and buyers sometimes do not care or out of ignorance do not check the warranty of the items. If you do not have a valid US warranty, the manufacturer WILL NOT SUPPORT in case there is a defect in your item. Companies suffer huge losses because of gray marketing of products, making the product costlier as a step to cover losses.", "Date": "August 25, 2013"}, {"Title": "Great Camera", "Author": "Korny Kollins", "ReviewID": "R3G95IBI6D57KQ", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "Love this camera !

Everything else is just extra goodies.The camera is insane. I haven't had anything but a point-n-click since high school. I won't be going back. This camera, even on automatic settings, makes me a pro. Quick settings get you pretty much any great shot at the flip of a dial, even if you're no cameraphile. The auto-focus is flippin' brilliant; fast, easy to figure out, and dead-on.If you're going to keep it in a case and protected, the D5200 is your camera. If you're going to be in the elements, you'll want the D7100 -- same basic camera, just more weather resistant. But it also costs about $1k more.I'm stuck on the 55-300 lens that came with this camera, and it's really why I bought this package. I haven't even put the standard 18-55 on it, yet, and I've had the camera for months, now. The 55-300 gives incredible depth of focus, and being able to get super-top-notch-quality candids (especially of my 2-year-old) makes it ideal. Amazing in low light, too.The 32 Gig card holds a metric crap-ton of pics. And the extra battery is great to have, and lasts forever. The case is OK for what it is, and it'll fit pretty much everything from this kit, minus the tripod. But it was too clunky for me, so I bought an Ape case that'll hold the camera with the 55-300 on it, an extra battery and the charger -- it's all I really need to carry around.Only downside is that the UV filters don't fit on either lens. So that's a waste. I'd really like filters on to protect the lens, so I guess I'll have to find a local store to purchase proper ones.

Great camera body.  Kit lenses are soft.  I ended up purchasing the Nikon 28-300mm f/3.5-5.6G to replace both the kit lenses, and will be selling those.The tripod is flimsy.  I would not put any camera of value on it.  Everything else came in the bundle as advertised, so no complaints there.  With the Nikon 28-300 on this body, this camera takes some sharp, richly colored photos, but there's a reason the Canon 5D3 is more than 4x the cost: much better images in every kind of light.  Megapixel ratings are not the whole story when evaluating a DSLR.  Yes, the Nikon is 24 megapixels (vs. my Canon's 22.3), and this little Nikon yields good images with a good lens, but it's very noisy at high ISOs owing, in part, to its smaller APS-C sensor.Yet while comparing the Nikon D5200 to a full frame Canon 5D3 isn't really a fair comparison, this Nikon does outperform the 18 megapixel Canon T3i in terms of image quality.

Most the items are included in the package. (7. I don\u2019t have the Free 25 Quality Prints inside\u2026)2. The Nikon D5200 camera body and lens are all brand new and in good shape.Bad things:1. The package was not that well protected, the outside box was already been pressed down, not enough cushions inside to protect the camera box. But thank God the camera and lens are all fine.2.

Would be 3 stars.- The LCD protective films haven't been open yet, so no comments on this.- SD Card Wallet, looks OK, although not great or very useful for me. Probably would rate it 2.5 or 3 stars.- Can't comment about the tripod as I haven't receive it yet (not vendor's issue, the bundle was received by my father and he hasn't give it to me yet :) )- The bag was the only real deception, is much cheaper than it looks in the pictures, I was already planning to buy another one but now I HAVE to buy a replacement. Feels really really cheap. I would rate it 2 stars.To sum up, the bundle is OK (would be 3 stars) as I already had low expectations for all the \"additional\" items.

Rather, I use cameras mostly as a hobby, but occasionally I've submitted photos to newspapers or local weather forecasters and had them published or shown on one of the local stations.  The purpose of this review is more to help you make a decision on the D5200 and whether it's the camera for you, not to go into technical jargon.  Up until the time I purchased this camera, I relied mainly on a Panasonic DMC FZ28 \"point and shoot\".  Since I was used to getting reasonably decent zoom with the FZ28, I opted to also purchase the Nikon 55-300mm VR lens to complement the 18-55mm VR lens that came with the D5200.  Between those two lenses, I figured I could cover most needs, but there are some minor drawbacks because it takes time to change the lenses and it's bulky to have to carry both of them around with you. That having been said, there is no question that the D5200 is one heck of a camera.  It takes crystal clear photos and has more functions than I will probably ever use in a lifetime.  However, if you are like me and had never used a digital SLR before, the level of sophistication this one possesses will probably leave you a bit lost at first. Therefore, if you do opt to get the D5200, you might want to consider getting a copy of the book \"Nikon D5200 For Dummies\" by Julie Adair King to help guide you through its many functions.  I won't go into the contents of that book here, but you can read my review of it elsewhere on the Amazon website. In short, I found the book to be extremely helpful and to be an excellent reference tool.  While the D5200 does have an automatic function, which makes it perform pretty much like a point and shoot, you would be wasting your money to buy the D5200 if that is the main thing you want to do with it. Since I've only had this camera for a short while, I'm still in the learning stage but I've already produced some really neat photos that would not have been possible with the Panasonic.  If you can think of something you would want a camera to do, this one probably does it.  Since it's clear that many of the reviews for this camera were written by folks who are either professionals or close to it, you will probably get a better picture (no pun intended) of what to expect from the D5200 from them than anything I would be capable of providing from the limited time I've had to mess around with it.  As indicated above, my purpose in writing this review was more to give you a heads up about what you'll be getting yourself into with the D5200.  It's a great camera, but get ready for a long learning curve if you want to use it to its full ability.  It's also not as \"handy\" as a point in shoot.  Not only because of its size, particularly with the 55-300mm zoom lens affixed to it, but also because you don't have the ability to go from taking a photo of something close by or which required a wide angle and to then quickly convert to a sizable zoom or vice versa.  And, if it's an action shot or a shot of a distant bird or animal and you have the 18-55mm lens in place at the time, you could easily lose the opportunity to get the picture you want.  That would not happen with a point and shoot that provides instant zooming with no lens change.  This is something to think about when you consider this camera, especially if it's going to be your only camera. While I do love the D5200, I am also going to be investing in one of the newer point and shoots with the improved zoom capability to replace the Panasonic DMC FZ28.  Then the challenge will be which camera I want to have with me when I head out to take some photos.", "Date": "May 8, 2014"}, {"Title": "Tripod was not present in the bundle.", "Author": "Sandeep B", "ReviewID": "R3TVHIW8S434D4", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "I received the package yesterday, tripod was missing, bag is of medium quality, SD card is from Sony, Camera and lenses look good.

But that is to be expected when you buy a camera that comes with a lens. It is great for a starter camera but I wish I would have done some more research before I bought it because for your first DSLR camera you should split your budget by spending 1/3 of it on the camera body and the other 2/3 on a really good lens! So my suggestion if you want to buy this camera is to buy just the body and then search for a quality 18-55mm lens. That is the lens you will want to be using for most photos (unless you only do close ups..).
