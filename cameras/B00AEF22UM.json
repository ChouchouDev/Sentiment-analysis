I take photos for our online business and photos of our family, but by no sense of the word am I a photographer.  I do not know or understand much beyond the basics of point, focus and shoot.  My husband is even more ignorant than I am.  With that said, this camera takes terrific photos with minimal fuss and very nice results.For you all out there who just want to take a photo of a scene, your loved one or a flower, this camera should do you just fine.  The Amazon bundle of accessories makes this a complete photo set up for enthusiastic  amateurs.When my husband can take clear sharp photos with a digital camera without a lot of fussing and cussing, it has to be a good camera.
