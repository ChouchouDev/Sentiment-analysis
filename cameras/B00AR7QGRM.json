Not really that little (bigger than it looks.)easy to use nad takes great photos that you can change the focus on after the fact on the camera screen, from the lytros downloader and from facebook or any social media page you download you photos to. Best of all not just you but anyone who looks at your photo can click on it and alter the focus without having to download anything.won't replace your point and shoot or you dSLR but great as a second camera for interesting pics.", "Date": "March 19, 2013"}], "ProductInfo": {"Price": null, "Features": null, "Name": null, "ImgURL": null, "ProductID": "B00AR7QGRM"}}
