{"Reviews": [{"Title": "Nice Basic Camera", "Author": "Jonny", "ReviewID": "R1LMZCPCQRYWM4", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "Amazon says this was just available on Amazon in 2013, but I've had mine for around 5 years now. It's easy to learn and it's not too different than many such cameras like it. So, no matter the brand, the functions are relatively the same. Natural light photos are the best, but it takes acceptable photos in lower light. The flash works best for objects in the foreground, but again, not so different than most in it's category.I believe this only came in white, which would not be my first choice, but it was a gift. I don't think I would have bought a white camera for myself, but if you keep it in a case as I do, it isn't a big deal. Mine doesn't have a scratch on it, but I would think that would show more than on another color.Nice accessory is the separate A/C batter charger. It's just for the two batteries, which is all you need. The rechargeable batteries included will also charge inside the camera using the included USB adapter. While you are downloading your photos, it doesn't drain your power. Having two ways to charge the batteries is a nice option.I haven't used the video option; just never needed to. Although I did accidentally take a few seconds here and there. I can't judge by that because it wasn't my intention so the quality wasn't good because I wasn't aware it was on.Overall, it's a neat little camera.", "Date": "October 12, 2013"}], "ProductInfo": {"Price": null, "Features": null, "Name": null, "ImgURL": null, "ProductID": "B00B4ZLJ5U"}}
