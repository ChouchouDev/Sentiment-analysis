Scott Broadway", "ReviewID": "R23N2EHSFQ8NT7", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I had been looking forward to this purchase ever since I saw the press release about the A610.  I ordered it from Amazon as soon as it was in stock, they shipped it immediately, one-day shipping got it to me exactly when I expected it.I am not ordinarily one to make such broad, sweeping statements, but I am very, VERY impressed with this camera.  Here are some initial impressions:- Movie mode is great...it makes AVI files in 160, 320, or 640 resolution (4:3) with okay quality mono sound.  It uses very low compression, so you get great quality but large file sizes.  The way I calculate it, you can get a 640x480 30fps AVI encoded at 2MB/s.  You can use the zoom before you hit the shutter, but you cannot zoom while filming.  Bummer.- The autofocus mechanism is spectacular.  It seems to have 9 zones in the AiAF setup, and will make a best guess at where you are focusing and show you those zones before you pull the shutter release.  You can also put it in \"FlexiZone\" which lets you move a single autofocus point around the frame, allowing you to ask the autofocus to aim wherever you'd like.  Macro focus is great...it really does focus accurately at ranges as close as a centimeter from the lens when zoomed all the way out (1x).  It does have a manual focus setting, but I can't yet beat the autofocus.- The \"My Colors\" feature is cool...one of the modes allows you to replace one color for another (you select by aiming the center of the frame at the colors you select).  You can also set it to select one hue, washing all others to grayscale.  For the photoshoppers out there, it's also got a mode where it stores both the original shot and the color-altered shot on the card.  No worries.- The photos I take with auto-exposure and autofocus turn out beautiful, crisp, and with great color balance (the RGB histograms look very even).  I can even get zoom shots of a close subject where the background appears blurred...very pretty.- The camera's user interface is quick enough to learn if you read the booklet.  On-screen menus are very informative without being over-designed.Do yourself a favor and buy this camera or the A620.  You will be investing in a very capable tool at an extraordinarily reasonable price.  Buy a big SD card, too, so you don't have to worry about setting the camera on anything but the highest resolution and lowest compression.", "Date": "October 10, 2005"}, {"Title": "Very pleased!", "Author": "Jerry98", "ReviewID": "R1FFQ2DZ0K8D9S", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I am very pleased with the camera, love the full manual settings, great movie mode (u can even zoom) and best of all it takes great pictures! This is the follow up camera to the A95, advantages include a bigger LCD, digic 2 processor (which means faster speed), high-speed 2.0 USB connection, better macro mode (less the half an inch!), 4 optical zoom. I think the biggest thing I noticed was the speed of the zoom lens and ability to focus. Macro shots is simply amazing! Personally I would get the Sandisk Ultra 2 SD memory card to go with this for top speed. Its a simply amazing camera you will love!", "Date": "October 4, 2005"}, {"Title": "Great camera!", "Author": "Nature Nut", "ReviewID": "RQQN6GMYI7H2B", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I am a first time buyer for this type of camera.  I spent days on the computer researching and trying to get the best deal for my money. I'm one picky customer and I really hunt for bargains! Consumer Reports rated the A95 as being a best buy, so when I heard that the A610 was a step up, I bought it.  I've also purchased the charger, batteries, and case to go with it.  (It's cheaper to buy them as a kit).  So far I've been thrilled with everything.  It is a great camera for both beginning and advanced users. The menu is not too complicated, like many of the cameras out there.  The quality is good also. It feels very sturdy and comfortable in my hand.  The size is perfect: not too small and not too large. I have larger hands and the buttons and controls are easy to use.  I love the zoom lens.  This camera has 20 different settings for picture-taking which was important for my husband and I because we like to take close-ups of nature.  It has other settings for taking action shots, portraits, snow, and beach pictures.  It even gives you the option of taking multiple shots and later turning them into a panoramic photo!  The screen is larger and swivels around to different positions so that I could even take a self-portrait if I wanted to.  This camera offers many thoughtful details and is easy to use (after you read the directions, of course).  I would not hesitate to recommend this fine camera!  It is a real deal for the money.UPDATE:  I'm still lovin' my camera!  It took a while to learn how to operate all the functions, but it's been fun!  The pictures are clear!  I can't imagine not having a camera that didn't have the swivel screen.  I just purchased a tripod and can now swivel the screen around and set the timer to see exactly where I need to stand to be sure we're all in the shot!  It's so nice that my husband wants one for himself!", "Date": "October 29, 2005"}, {"Title": "Excellent Camera", "Author": "J. Haindel \"Jay\"", "ReviewID": "R1UYJMU4PGAAX6", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I have my A610 a week now after having owned two digital cameras.  The last camera was a Canon A10 so this camera is a vast improvement.  I love this camera!  The pictures are wonderfully clear and crisp.  My only negative comment is that it is a little tricky getting a good focus and exposure at macro settings. This thing will focus down to 1 cm! I found it best not to use the flash on close up shots as it tends over expose. The manual tells you this and a good exposure is possible with just a minimal amount of light without the flash.  The menus are straight forward but complex.  Canon has allowed settings for just about everything. I can't imagine a setting that was missed. The camera is slightly on the large size and a little heavy since it has 4 batteries, but it runs forever on that power source.  The extra space needed for the batteries gives the camera  a nice grip since the front protrudes out allowing you to hold the camera very still for low light settings.  I like the finish on the camera contrary to previous complaints.  It is a textured silver finish rather than gloss and, I guess, it all a matter of taste.  I do not think it has a cheap finish. Besides, the fit or the various pieces are almost perfect.  This should not discourage you from buying this camera. Actually, I would have preferred an all black camera anyway, but silver seems to be the rage these days.  It has wonderful low light capabilities which are better than my old 35mm SLR.  I was really surprised about this.  I have noticed no noise problems in really low light.  The mechanical mechanisms are quiet and sound very refined.  My old camera was rough and noisy.  We looked at a lot of cameras an did a great deal of research.  I am very satisfied with this purchase and highly recommend it.", "Date": "December 6, 2005"}, {"Title": "Great Camera, worth every penny", "Author": "TheM", "ReviewID": "R1UJEBCMI5HFLA", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "The Cannon PowerShot A610 is a wonderful camera.- 4 AA batteries mean that you don't have to charge a proprietary battery pack and you can refill at any store- Long battery life, we use 2000mAh NiMH AAs and they last for weeks of casual shooting. At a friends wedding I took over 200 pictures, most with flash and did not need new batteries.- Fast shutter response, not as fast as an SLR, but close.- Large fold out screen, this opens up a huge range of picture taking that you never thought possible.- Great pictures on the auto setting, just point and shoot for setting free pictures.- Great range of settings, from \"kids and pets\" for fast shots to completely manual.- Buy the fastest 1GB card you can find and you will never have to worry about changing cards again.- Great movie mode, perfect for those moments that look better on film.- Excellent display options for reviewing your photos.- Additional timer function where you can have it take multiple shots after a delay so if people are blinking or being silly you have several to choose from without running back to the camera- The only drawback is its size, if you want a \"pocket\" camera this is not for you, the large size does make it easy to hold and stable for using the timer.", "Date": "January 24, 2006"}, {"Title": "Best camera for twice its cost!", "Author": "Method2Madness \"Alex\"", "ReviewID": "R2F3X703P76TUW", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I have owned many brands of Digiams from HP to Sony to Kodak and have found this to be the best of them all(with Sony as a close runner-up).

For all those with the e18 errors, heres a solution.....DONT DROP YOUR CAMERA! Treat it gently and for the most part, it will last quite a while. The pictures you get from this are simply stunning. Perfectly saturated colors with VERY little noise(Even on high ISO's). Battery life is very good with nimh's, mainly due to utilizing 4 batteries. I routinely get 200-300 pictures on a set of fully charged NiMh AA's and around 100 pics on your run of the mill Alkaline AA's(NOT reccomended by the way). The interface is FULL of features, yet not too overwhelming. The new \"My Colors\" setting yields an absolutely stunning twist to your photos! For this year they have also increased the zoom to a 4x!

The A610 is an improvement in every aspect.*  Video mode is great!  You get full motion videos at 600x480 that look great when played back on  a TV.  I had just bought a digital video camcorder, JVC-GR270, and I'm returning the camcorder because the Canon simply put its videos to shame.  I STRONGLY recommend the1GB SD Card and get an \"ultra fast\" version.* Very useful additional photo features.  It allows you to trya trial flash so that it can correct exposure, before the actualflash shot to avoid wash out.* In review mode you can see a histogram of color levels.* I didn't think I would find a lot of use for the flexible LCDdisplay.  But it comes in very handy in macro mode and also fortaking self portraits.* It has full manual controls and Canon has improved the button controls on the back.* VERY nice that you can use 4 double-A batteries of your choice.  I was able to shoot hundreds of photos with the LCD on all the time on one set.Just a great camera.", "Date": "December 28, 2005"}, {"Title": "Good price, excellent features, easy to use", "Author": "Miles", "ReviewID": "R1S48VTO6YQSRB", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "I bought this camera for my parents to replace their old Olympus 1.2 megapixel camera.  My Mom was convinced she'd need at least 6 megapixels but I proved to them 5 mp gives you more than enough quality (unless of course you are a professional).  Not to mention with the release of the A620, this camera has become quite the bargain.  You won't see too many 5 megapixel cameras with all the features this has for much cheaper.  The optical zoom is a must in the camera world.  Sure, you think you won't use the zoom much but you'll discover later on you really needed it.This camera is small, but not that small and despite being made of some kind of plastic has a very sturdy, metallic feel to it.  It fits comfortable in even a man's large hands and let's you avoid that problem of shakiness many of the too small digital cameras have.  The interface is easy to use, simple, and effective.  There is a dial for most of the features an amateur photographer would need to use in a split second, and I love the LCD screen on the back.  It's the right size and perfectly movable.  The grip on the side of this camera is one of its best features.  Not only does it let you take secure pictures if you are like me and have shakey hands, but it's also nice when maybe you are leaning out or in a moving vehicle trying to take a picture, you feel like you have a really good grip on your camera.Another feature I like is that the lens is interchangeable and you can buy more advanced lenses to serve your particular needs.  The package came with a USB cable adapter that lets you get all your pictures off the camera without ever having to touch the memory card.All in all I think this is a perfect choice for the average consumer.  It is a little pricey through Amazon, more affordable through some other retailers, but a good buy nonetheless.  Things I'd like to see with it would be maybe a case or easy way to protect it, and it's also not the kind of camera you could easily slip into your pocket or anything.  It's not that advanced in features, but consider what it's aiming for I think it does a good job.", "Date": "February 9, 2006"}, {"Title": "A winner", "Author": "ATL-Carpetbagger", "ReviewID": "R2EBHE0LNWZSVU", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "Just used this for three weeks in Asia. It took hundreds of gorgeous shots without a hitch. Battery life was good and flexible resolution/detail options allowed me to save memory for the \"big\" shots. I love the detail and color in the pics; really didn't regret leaving my slide film behind. I also brought my 3MP Canon A400 to use as a \"pocket\" camera, but never took it out of the case because this one, though no Elph in size, is handy to carry and has addictive features. I was skeptical about the flip-around screen, but have found it very useful. Aside from the  unobtrusiveness of looking away while shooting a subject, it basically saved me from lugging around a tripod because I could use any surface to stablize the camera in low light and simply move the screen to see the subject. This also helps the camera shake problem. I agree with those who find the \"shake\" icon appears too frequently, but it really does stop you from taking a pic that will only appear out of focus once you blow it up at home. If you're taking a lot of action shots in low light without a flash, you may need to go deeper into the software than I did to see if the settings will adapt to your purposes. The AV door is also flimsy, as others mentioned, not my favorite feature, but at least it's flexible so it doesn't break off. I looked at a lot of camera sites before choosing this model, and have been very happy with its ease of use, quality, and reliability. It was easy (and cheap) to transition to this from the smaller Canon, as the software, SD card, and batteries were the same. There are definitely sleeker models out there (HP ,Sony), but for me this was a great combination of ease of use, functionality, quality, and price.", "Date": "January 31, 2006"}, {"Title": "By far the best deal I found", "Author": "A Customer \"customer12345657\"", "ReviewID": "RR9FEGOHQAO5T", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I suffered through a few cheaper cameras, all with disappointing results, before paying for this one. Digital cameras still aren't as cheap as film cameras, so you really just need to pay more if you want a good one. Maybe some cheaper digital cameras are OK for some people, but this one zooms farther, shoots faster, and takes better pictures. Indoor pictures come out pretty good (cheaper cameras take terrible indoor pictures) and outdoors it is just amazing.It has a variety of settings you can adjust, but I just leave it set to automatic mode and it works better than messing around with modes and settings on cheaper cameras. The only things you really need to touch are the macro option for really close pictures (within a few inches) and sometimes you might want to turn the flash off manually, although most of the time it will turn off automatically when not needed. Eventually I will try playing with different settings, but for now I am just thrilled with how well it works on auto.The first one I got was defective, but with Amazon I didn't have to pay anything for return shipping either direction to get it replaced.", "Date": "January 18, 2006"}, {"Title": "Great photos", "Author": "B.

I don't recall ever seeing this schism before, but it exists for good reason. The camera takes lovely pictures, given enough light, maybe some of the best I've seen from a Point-and-Shoot... when it works. So if a reviewer's cam is still working, 5 stars make sense. But so many report the e18 lens error or, like mine, the dreaded black screen, that Canon needed to step up and handle these better. I sent mine in, and got the usual $107 quote to fix it out of warranty. Having read other reviews, I think I'll just let it slide, since even cameras that have been repaired continue to have problems.For me, it boils down to a company's integrity. With such a proliferation of complaints, Canon needed to own up to the problem. Instead, they're trying to reward their own lack of QC by earning more money on repair of an unreliable camera. They do offer to \"upgrade\" you to an A540, I believe it is, for \"only\"  $100. The A540 lacks the swivel screen of the 610, which was why I bought my 610 in the first place, and has some of the same problems reported.Third strike is that, while most digicams mount on my Mac desktop when plugged in, the Canon requires software to download the pictures. Alas, \"convenient\" integrity, sloppy repairs and interface problems equal three strikes for Canon. I'll be looking elsewhere for a pocketable camera.*** A very pleasant postscript on the issue of integrity. ***I contacted Canon and, upon my polite request, they agreed to repair the camera \"as a goodwill gesture.\" I had mentioned this site and the 25% of reviews indicating problems. They hastened to add that they utilize an internal database to track problems, and that these reviews played no part in their decision.

Allen Greenbaum", "ReviewID": "R3PEBJ4JZHZYE0", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "It was great while it lasted.Canon loads more quality optical elements and automatic features in the A610 than you'll find on any other disposable camera.  Outstanding zoom lens, automation that ranges from full (a variety of easy-to-use presets that adjust for scenery), to moderate (e.g., speed priority or aperture priority), to none (manual operation), my Canon gave me excellent pictures for about 19 months. That's right, it was almost two full years before the Canon stopped working--try beating that with your disposable!At 19 months, the camera's viewfinder suddenly malfunctioned. I couldn't see an image through the LCD viewer, neither on picture preview (before you take the picture) nor on picture review. Staff at a professional camera shop said that it was probably the CCD sensor.  Canon told me they'd repair it for $107 since the camera was over its one year warranty.If you Google Canon A610 CCD problem (and you should, I think, if you're considering this or any other Canon), you'll come to a thread on the CNET consumer electronics forum.  Have a loved one or some tranquilizers nearby; this is scary stuff.  IT appears that many people have had the same or a similar problem with their A610.  In fact, Canon admits that several models made between 2002 and 2004 used faulty CCD sensors made by Sony; it issued \"advisories\" on these models (some of which are still sold), and, laudably, they will fix CCD-related problems for free.Even though a professional camera shop told me that my A610 probably had this problem, Canon would not budge because the A610 is not on their \"advisory\" list. If you have some evidence that this is the problem (Google CCD sensor problems and you'll learn some of the symptoms, and their prevalence), you will need to call the Canon Factory Service Center and argue tenaciously why you believe Canon should pay all repair fees. Canon apparently will NOT admit that the A610 has a CCD problem--that would open up the model to costly recalls. When I received mine back (repaired for free after much investment of time and emotion), the repair sheet vaguely noted only a problem with the \"optical assembly.\" How informative--A camera itself is just one complex \"optical assembly!\"  The invoice did not specify the specific problem or what was replaced or repaired--itself an indictment of Canon's (lack of) Candor in dealing with this problem.Depending on how legitimate your claim and your persistence in reaching a supervisor, Canon will offer discounted repair prices (for example, 1/2 off, 3/4 off). Go for 100% off if you believe that Canon is at fault. Go to forums.cnet.com for some consumer accounts of the problem and Canon's response. I believe Canon claims that all CCD problems ended after 2004. You might ask yourself, then, why so many people report such similar problems, often with A610s bought within the same period (towards the end of 2005).If you must buy this camera, or if you already own one, consider an extended repair contract if one is available. In fact, this might be a good idea for ANY Canon product with an \"optical assembly.\"Otherwise, console yourself with the fact that you have bought the greatest disposable camera ever made.", "Date": "November 14, 2007"}, {"Title": "Canon Powershot A610", "Author": "K.

I did a little research and read only good things about this Canon camera so I decided to go with it because it was very reasonably priced (about $200). Not only did the camera live up to my expectations, it surpassed them by leaps and bounds! Here are the things I have loved about this camera:BATTERY - this camera has the best battery of any digital camera I have ever owned or used. At first I was worried since it uses four AA batteries instead of two like my other cameras, but it was advertised to have a good battery life so I was hopeful. Let me tell you that I have had this camera about six months and have not had to change the batteries yet! And I use the camera quite a bit. I used it for church Vacation Bible School all week, youth weekend retreat, family vacation, pictures of friends and pets, all of this and the battery is still going strong! If I had not experienced this, I would not believe it was possible for any digital camera to do so well with batteries (my Kodak sucked the life out of batteries in a matter of just a few hours or less!)EASY TO USE - I was able to sit down with the camera and figure out pretty much all of the functions in a very short period of time and with very little reference to the manual. (And I'm no technology expert).PICTURE QUALITY - all of the pictures I've taken and printed out have been great. The camera is a 5.0MP camera and it does a great job for it's resolution I think. All my pictures have been sharp, clear, and great color.FEATURES - I love the ability to quickly and easily change between outdoor, indoor, different lighting conditions, action vs. still shots, close-up, etc. And it makes a real difference in the quality of the pictures to be able to tell the camera what the conditions are of the picture you are trying to take.LCD SCREEN - I was hoping to get a camera with a very large LCD screen, but quickly discovered that I like the swivel feature on this camera even more than having a huge LCD. Being able to swing the screen out and turn it around gives you that much more versatility in what pictures you can take. It revolutionized the \"self-portrait\" :)SD MEMORY CARD - I was also looking for a camera that used SD memory cards. Mostly because that was what I'd used before and all of my other pictures were on SD Memory. So that was a big plus for me. That may be different for each person though depending on which type of media you are used to using.I cannot stress how highly I recommend this camera. I will never buy another digital camera besides Canon again.

I was completely satisfied and happy with all picture-taking features. Just getting into shooting videos by early summer and still very enthused.  So I decided to buy my daughter an early Christmas present  - a PowerShot A610 - in August 2006.Then, on November 17, 2006, I had just inserted a fresh SD memory card and turned on the camera when it issued a loud \"scream\" and the LCD screen displayed \"E18.\" The lens barrel had partly extended and apparently the gears for that function had \"stripped,\" causing the startling noise.  I contacted Canon and the camera was repaired at no charge under warranty. It was back in my hands in about 10 days after I shipped to Canon.  BUT - since then, this camera has exhibited a strange behavior where it will partly extend the lens barrel (the same \"optical assemby\" Canon replaced) spontaneously (all by itself, without use of the power button).  I have searched the web and found that others complain about the \"E18\" failure of the opitical assembly.BUT that's not all: On Christmas Day, as my daughter and I prepared to visit relatives, we were checking our cameras when  my daughter told me her A610 had  suddenly (at that moment) displayed \"Insert Memory Card\" on its LCD screen. Subsequent tests with 3 other identical memory cards for my camera (Kingston  SD, 1 GB)  failed to be detected in her camera.  The memory card in her camera was OK - I was able to rescue images on it by inserting it in my A620 and downloading to my computer.  I'm awaiting word from her on what Canon is doing to correct the problem with her camera.STILL not all: during that same period (November - December 2006) the adult daughter of a close friend had HER Canon A610 go bad. The problem was failure of the LCD screen - it just went blank and stayed that way.Again - Canon was prompt in fixing that problem but the point here is that THREE of the A600 series cameras owned by different people developed three different problems (all warranty covered) in the span of about 6 weeks.Since that time, I've heard more of the same from some people - while others have had no problems with their \"A600s\" and love them.  But I cannot recommend this series because it appears to have a high failure rate.  To have a camera that takes great pictures and videos which \"quits\" disasterously just when you plan on using it for something important makes that camera worse than useless - its a huge disappointment and I wouldn't wish that on anyone.Meanwhile - my \"solution\" to this was to buy a Canon PowerShot S3-1S; an even better camera with more features (image stabilization!  - 12X zoom! -  audio recording! ) and its much more strongly constructed.Since neither the A600s nor the S3 series are \"pocket cameras\" - the added bulk is not that big a factor to me.Canon is a fine brand and has many other models to suit virtually any photographic need.

This is a digicam that can take video as well.I would definitely recommend this product to anyone who wants a point and shoot camera and have a little bit of control for things like shutter speed, aperture blah blah blah.Definitely get at least a 512 high speed SD card to minimize the time it takes from taking the picture to trying to take the next but that can be remedied by the burst mode.The only thing that I don't like about this camera (and it really isn't a big deal at least for now) is the zoom.  albeit, it't great zoom for a small camera, I would prefer to have at least 10x-12X zoom with image stabilization as well as a live histogram.I might keep this camera for a while till I get my skills improved but the next camera I want is the S2 IS.Bottom line, this will do what you want it to do and if you have time to play around with it a bit, then this is the camera for you.

This was the only camera in this price range that does this, and I've been quite happy with it overall.The pictures are always good quality, and the videos are pretty nice. They are not DVD quality, but they're not bad and are pretty close to what you get with an old VHS recorder. With a 1 GB memory card, I can get about 8 minutes worth of video at 30 frames/sec, 640x480 resolution. My only gripe about the videos is that there is a high-pitched noise on all of them. Its not a real loud noise and it doesn't ruin the videos, but it is noticeable.While the features are good, I do question the quality. Right after I bought it, the automatic lens cover wouldn't shut right. Then, about a month later, the whole lens assembly just froze up and wouldn't retract at all. The camera was useless at this point.  I sent it in for warranty service and it took about three weeks from the time I sent it to the time I got it back. As one reviewer noted, they do keep you pretty well informed of whats going on during the repair period. I have had no major problems with the  repaired camera, though once in a while the on/off button gets stuck.So, overall, was satisifed with the camera features and the Canon warranty service, but I do wonder about the quality of these cameras.

I contacted Canon USA. Canon replied that it had not tested the various SD cards on the market. I went on to look for answers over the Internet, and concluded that Canon PowerShot A610 could benefit from higher speed SD cards capable of writing up to 5 mbps or 33X.In his recent article \"Compact Flash and SD Cards,\" Bob Atkins indicated that the speed at which data is written to the flash memory card depends upon three factors: the maximum write speed of the card, the maximum write speed of the camera, and the efficiency of the interaction between the camera's software and the card's onboard controller. Canon PowerShot A610 employs the DIGIC II Imaging Processor for picture quality and processing speed. In the article, Canon EOS 20D containing the same DIGIC II processor tops out at 5 mbps when writing to a card capable of writing 9 mbps. Canon PowerShot A610 would expect to write in similar speed and thus benefit from a higher speed SD card capable of write speed 5 mbps (I am ignoring the third factor here).The write speed of most SD cards appears to be 1.2 mbps that is 8X (1X = 0.15 mbps). For Canon PowerShot A610, SD cards capable of writing speed between 33X and 50X would be sufficient. Be mindful that the advertised multipliers would often indicate the read speeds only. For example, a 50X SD reads up to 10 mbps, but writes only 1.2 mbps (8X). A 150X SD reads at the promised 22.5 mbps but writes 15.0 mbps (100X).

The primary reason I bought the A610 in the first place is the vari-angle LCD and was cheap for $90 at the time. That vari-angle LCD has helped me shoot at odd angles accurately though not out in bright sunlight. Other features like  the Optical Viewfinder, and 58mm bayonet mount for adapters/filters/lenses were also key  for me to getting the A610. Pretty rare for me to find such features altogether especially on modern Pocket Point&Shoot; cameras especially the Canon A-series with Digic IV/V processors.Minor gripe  it's terrible in low-light conditions with or without flash especially with fast subjects typical of  digital cameras with small CCD sensors and outdated processors.In the case of problems with the camera i'm probably lucky never to have gotten the blank black screen or CCD failures since 2009.The only major problem I had with it was the stuck lens shutter which only opens halfway when on.

I am relatively good with tech-stuff but I am also impatient!  I need gadgets to work, work fast, work right and I don't read the manuals!  Now that I've been upfront.....this camera, while it has a LOT of bells and whistles for an average-everyday-point-and-shoot, it has been tride and true for the past 6-ish years.  So much so that I have been reluctant to replace it!THE PROS:- Swivel LCD screen.  This is awesome when kiddos have events and there is a sea of kids.....I can still film or take pics of mine & see what I'm doing.- 4x Optical zoom is great!  Looking for more zoom with a new one, but 4x was usually sufficient for everyday photos.- AMAZING photos, period.  Lot's of defeatable modes if you want to play with F-stops/Appeture/ExposureTime/etc.  I am not a photographer, so these took a little work to manipulate & use, but I was able to take one of those cool time-delay pics with tail lights streaking by AND get a really nice picture of my kids sleeping in a dark room without using the flash (used a cheap tripod to steady the camera)!  **One of my favorite features on this camera is the half-button focus.....in regular Auto mode, you can half-depress the shutter button and it will focus (green box or boxes for \"OK\" and red for \"try again\") for you.  I was able to get dozens of FANTASTIC action shots of my kids playing soccer.  Other parents thought a pro had taken the shots as they were perfect 'freeze frame' shots of body-defying feats (it took about 100 shots during a game to get a couple good ones - but they are priceless!).- Portable Scanner!  I use this camera to \"scan\" documents, receipts, and other misc. items all the time.  It's better quality than my very nice scanner!  With or without flash, I use it both ways and always get great results.- The casing is SO DURABLE!  I am a total clutz!  I have dropped this poor camera so many times (and on hard surfaces) that I am shocked the lens/LCD/inner guts are still in pristine condition.  The outer casing even has gaps where the drop caused the outer casing to crunch a bit.....it has not stopped taking phenomenal pics!- Battery Life is......A LOT!  The camera is heavy, I won't deny that.  Mostly due to the required 4 x AA batteries to run the thing.  BUT, this usually means I can get weeks of life out of the camera.  On a recent trip to Disney for 3 straight days I brought a back-up set and did not have to replace until mid-3rd day.....and I take lots of photos AND short video clips too.- Great video for a camera.....if you are a screaming soccer mom I recommend toning it down, as the mic picks up the user QUITE clearly (no whispers, or the cam will pick it up!).  It does a nice job of getting the kids saying \"I'm open, pass it!\" from across the field though!  The video becomes very grainy with the zoom past about 2x though.  But awesome for Xmas pics and switching quick to video - and back again.  I feel like I've not missed a moment of those all-important first years!CONS....Hardly anything....!- The little plastic 'door' that covers the digital AVout is kind of a pain, as it's soft rubber, and the 'catch' no longer really catches.  I have to really press it in to get it to stay closed.- the lens cover flaps (these swivel out of the way as the camera turns on, & swivel back into place on power down).....well, these broke when a little-one but placed a finger in the teeth to see if it would 'pop out' so I can hardly blame Canon for this!

It is the best camera I have used in it's price range (i.e., $150, give or take a few dollars) and the multi angle, flip screen makes taking candid photos much easier since you can hold the camera from positions other than in front of your face (a pretty obvious position if you want to get natural expressions with people rather than nervous poses and cheesy smiles) and opens the door for creative angles, which I personally enjoy.

The photos are beautiful and I took so many photos, that I filled up my 1GB memory card.  I bought some long lasting Energizer Titanium batteries and they lasted throughout my trip - and I had turned the camera on and off quite a bit (everyday for 2 weeks)!I have not had a problem with the little floppy cover for the USB port like everyone else has mentioned - you just need to be careful with it and it snaps back into place every time.The only drawbacks to this camera is outside night shots - they don't come out as well as daytime shots and it is a little bit bulky/heavy (for my tastes, but I am comparing it with my really small Nikon Coolpix 775), especially with the 4 AA batteries it needs.In summary - I love the camera for the $200 pricetag (what I paid for it in 3/06) and would highly recommend it to anyone who wants an easy-to-use camera with lots of functionality, and wants clear and vibrant photos.", "Date": "June 7, 2007"}, {"Title": "Excellent Camera", "Author": "Peter B.

I've owned two Canon digital cameras (S10 and A60) prior to upgrading to the A610.  My experience with all three cameras has been very good.  For my taste, Canon cameras have achieved a near-perfect balance of features and image quality.  My A60 turned out spectacular photos; the A610 is a decent upgrade in features and still turns out perfect photos one after the other.  My previous Canon cameras were essentially trouble-free; however, the A610 only lasted five months before experiencing an internal failure that required it to be returned for warranty service.  More on that in a bit.First, the A610 provides great features at an unbeatable price.  It includes the full range of auto and manual exposure controls, an excellent movie mode, and a swivel LCD screen that comes in handy more than you'd think.  The Canon Digic II processor is superfast in focusing and exposure lock which helps you snap quick photos with little shutter lag.  My previous Canons were noticeably slower to lock on and take the picture.  The A610 provides you full control over every aspect of picture control (ISO, white balance, flash intensity, just to name a few).  While the AUTO setting is the easiest to use for most people, I prefer the \"P\" setting that allows me to select a few custom settings to tweak the exposures to my preferences.  Plus, this camera goes for a couple months on a single set of rechargeable AA batteries.  All this in a nicely built metal/plastic body that has a good handgrip but that's not too bulky.Now about my A610 failure.  After five months of routine use (and no mishandling or drops of any kind) the camera suddenly stopped taking pictures.  It powered up fine and could playback previous photos on the memory card but it couldn't take new pictures.  When in the \"shooting\" mode, the LCD was blank except for the menu icons.  When I snapped a picture, the camera took only black pictures (no image at all).  I tried all of the troubleshooting steps but to no avail.  At this point I knew that the camera had an internal failure and so I called Canon Factory Service.  They were courteous and after a few questions they recommended I return it for warranty repair which would take 7-10 days turnaround.  When asked if they would repair my exact camera (I asked twice) I was assured that my serial number camera would be repaired and returned to me.  I was suspicious of this since most companies prefer to send you a replacement (or refurbished) unit because it's quicker and cheaper for them to process.  Either way, their website includes a simple Repair Request form that you can fill out and print to send along with your camera.  All Canon digital cameras go to either Chicago or New Jersey for service; mine was sent to Chicago.  I packaged up the camera as instructed (camera only, no memory card, no batteries, no strap) and sent it off.Within five days I received a notification email and a snail mail letter that confirmed receipt of my camera for repair. Pretty good.  In addition, I was able to track my repair status on their website.  Within the following three days, the status said my camera was repaired.  One day later I received an email with the FedEx airbill number that indicated my camera was on its way to me.  Sure enough, the package arrived on time --the whole repair process from my shipment to their return took under two weeks.  Very good, in my opinion.When I opened the box, I found an A610 camera, my original shipping documents, and a repair order that stated that the servicing techinician had recommended a \"replacement\" instead of a repair for my camera.  Sure enough, the A610 sent back to me was a different serial number than my original camera.  Just as I suspected would be the case.  Well, at least they didn't disappoint but I do wish that Canon Service would have told me that up front instead of leading me to believe that my camera would be repaired.  This may not be a problem for most people (since we really just want a working camera) but when it comes time to upgrade, I like to re-sell my old camera along with the original box, manuals, and accessories.  Now with my new replacement camera, the serial number on my old box and the replacement camera don't match and so I'll have to explain this.  To Canon's credit, the replacement camera they sent me was in perfect condition and appeared brand new (even had the stickers on it) and works perfectly.  However, I believe that technically this camera is \"refurbished\" because Canon marks a small dot next to the serial number on the bottom of the camera.  I have seen this before and it flags to Canon Service that this camera is a refurb if it is ever returned in the future (different warranty applies).  Overall, the warranty process is what I expected and for all practical purposes, it is the best one could hope for.Bottom line:  Great camera. Should you need service, it's likely that you won't get your original camera back but you'll be sent a replacement \"refurb\" instead.  This is common practice for consumer electronics and in the end, is probably the only way a company that sells millions of cameras can possibly turnaround warranty service in a reasonable amount of time.  It is simply too expensive to disassemble, troubleshoot, and repair each and every camera that is returned under warranty (especially when the original camera only cost $200!).  That's life in the electronics age where we demand maximum value for the lowest possible price.For me, Canon stood by their product and returned a perfect working replacement.

And, it's also terrific for someone looking to learn more about digital photography by using the many modes, including manual, to have more control over your snapshots.Although I haven't used the video mode much at this point, it appears to be quite capable of producing good vids.I would suggest getting a 1Gb card right from the start.

Hiking, swimming, biking, and other general outdoor use - this camera has been at my side the whole time, and has not had one single problem.  The pictures are great for a point and shoot camera - I am by no stretch of the imagination a great photographer, but I turn out a gem every once in a while simply with the \"auto\" setting.  People have mentioned problems with the flash cards - I got a 1GB Corsair card (I'm a computer geek, and I'm very loyal to Corsair RAM).  It's fast, it holds a good amount of pictures and video, and again, it has NEVER given me a problem.The one negative thing that I can say is that when shooting a video, it gets fairly grainy when you zoom in.All in all, though, the A610 does everything I need it to do, and well.  I recommend it, but I also recommend getting the underwater case if you plan on bringing it along with you frequently during outdoor activities.", "Date": "May 12, 2008"}, {"Title": "Solid Camera", "Author": "Michael R.

I believe it's a good camera.  Time will tell.  However, you should be warned that the software is very, very bad, does not correspond to what is in the manual, and is likely to screw up your computer.  So, in spite of the repeated warnings that you \"must\" install the software on you computer before connecting to download the pictures--which is pure hokum--you should not use the software at all.  In fact, it might be okay for managing pictures, but it completely screwed up my computer system, and I learned, as I had expected, that you don't need it at all.  The best thing, for all digital cameras, is to get the PCMCIA adapter and use that to copy pictures into your computer from the memory card.  By all means DON'T USE CAMERA COMPANIES' SOFTWARE.  My experience with Kodak and now with Canon, is that it is not only poorly written, it may well damage your system.  In my case installtion of the Canon software resulted in inability to communicate with other computers on my LAN, and reset my power management options.  Furthermore, the install program never finishes, it continues to recycle endlessly until you stop it.", "Date": "December 28, 2005"}, {"Title": "Very Very Disappointing purchase", "Author": "Benny K.

And hoping that Powershot A610 is an improved one,(so naturally better than A95) I recommented and bought one for my friend. What a pity! The machine noise when I zoom it, is terrible. I am afraid I will wake up people if they are resting with this noise. In quite places like a church or somewhere I am very hesitant to use it. The cover of USB/AV port is worse than paper. It just does not remain close often and be very careful to press it too hard. It may be a plastic stuff, but more flexible and shapelss than a thick paper. And once I attach the hand string, i cannot close it or open it freely! And i found it really terrible.The SPORTS MODE (or the fast shutter mode) for shooting, which I greatly appreciate is just missing from this 'improved' model.I do not simply understand how could people say that this is a great camera with its terrible machine noise and its disappointing cover of the USB connection.", "Date": "June 17, 2006"}, {"Title": "Bad Customer Service", "Author": "Dr. Craig R.

I called and called when it never came back only to be redirected to a new department every time I spoke with someone.  I was always cordial on the phone, only to be treated with apathy or rudeness everytime I called.  I emailed only to get a 1800 number to call.

It is touted to be the successor of A95 but its a let down compared to A95.I am not a very experienced photographer, but it did not take me long to figure out that objects falling in shade appear very dark. Specially pictures which have a mix of sunlight and shade get spoiled because of this. There was no such problem with A95. Also the pictures and movies taken in night are much darker than it appears on the LCD. I have tried different shooting modes and increased exposure, but so far i am unable to get rid of it. I am still exporing the camera so may be i will find out a way to get around this.Another let down was the cheap finishing of the camera, I was in a bit of shock to see that a brand new product from a company like canon can have such a bad finishing.The processing is much faster than A95 and 4x Optical zoom is very helpful.
