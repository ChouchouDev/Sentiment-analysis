{"Reviews": [{"Title": "Does the job with style", "Author": "Amazon Customer", "ReviewID": "R1ERI9S995MK2F", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "Downloading digital image files from my camera memory card goes much quicker using this USB3 card reader for Compact Flash  and SDHC memory cards. The newbie trinkets that came with the package were of little or some use for me, but the card reader in what I wanted. When not in use, it folds down nicely inside the attached dust cover. When dealing with electronic connections, any dust is your enemy. It looks nice and fits right in with the design of my desktop computer. The fact that I use Lexar memory cards assures that I'll always get a good connection for upload and download processing. If your computer is USB3 enabled and you use either SDHC or Compact Flash memory cards, you need this card reader because most computers (mine is only a year old) only support the smaller sized memory cards now. I highly recommend it.", "Date": "April 13, 2013"}], "ProductInfo": {"Price": null, "Features": null, "Name": null, "ImgURL": null, "ProductID": "B00B86NIKY"}}
