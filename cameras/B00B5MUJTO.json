{"Reviews": [{"Title": "S4200 - 4500 Need To Share", "Author": "Lumix Fan \"Bob\"", "ReviewID": "R7DWHEMBQHRN7", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "Why I need to share.... I have been a photographer for decades and have had dozens of digital cameras of all price ranges so may be helpful to some looking for this type of camera. Long lens at under $200. Not a mini pocket camera but about perfect in the hand.Had both 4200 and 4500 cameras for several weeks now and used both enough to think I know something about this camera as they only differ in the lenses. The negative remarks on Amazon had me comparing my experiences but I am very impressed with what I found. Two things seem near top of importance to me, quality of pictures and feel using the camera. I liked the 25mm 4200 so much I purchased the 30mm 4500 too.- Time between shots is effected by the speed of the memory card as class 10 gives about 1/2 second recovery for next shot, which seems much the same as most cameras performance today.- Case design is great. It has some plastic textured surface everywhere your fingers may want to grip and a rubber grip on the lens barrel. Also feels substantial and balanced with 4 batteries installed. Flash pop-up button release handy to hit left of flash unit.- Picture quality is similar to other better consumer cameras. But the big lens delivers better quality than any camera this price range I know of, with color details surprising. I use local mountain scenes for outside test comparisons and this camera has created detailed quality even out to 25mm and 30mm full zoom shots better than any more expensive cameras I have owned.- Battery life is great too.- Auto focus seems fast to lock on.- Price is a deal!Only somewhat negative thing I found is the battery door has stiff spring contacts that take a little care to close, needing one hand to release the lock button while pressing down on the lid and the second to press down too while sliding lid closed. (Works for me..)There are many technical things camera reviewers cover but what is important that I want this camera with me at all times. It has been a blast going around finding anything to \"test\" the camera because it takes great pictures. Is that not enough!", "Date": "October 10, 2012"}, {"Title": "Great Camera, great price", "Author": "Russo", "ReviewID": "R3U3VEOJ6TSQP1", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I was in the market for a new camera, started to make photography a side hobby, and need an inexpensive camera with a good zoom, options, features, and quality pictures within a reasonable budget of course. Looked around, read reviews, walked the counters of countless electronic stores until faith found me in the form of a costco flyer. $50 off the Fujifilm S4500, I read the online reviews and was somewhat impressed. Costco has a no hassle return policy so I figured I had nothing to lose but $5 in gas money. Purchased the Fujifilm S4500 and I must say that I have no regrets in using up $5 in gas because it is a fantastic camera. Living in California, I took the opportunity to test it out on the beach for a beautiful sunset. The sunset feature was amazing, the pictures I was able to take was beyond my expectations. The colors were perfect, the contrast between the setting sun and objects in front was excellent. The images that were taken at home on \"auto\" when I first received it were also great. The picture quality of the camera is perfect when used properly!!!! And \"used properly\" is the key word. I read the manual before using the camera, and not the printed one. They included a CD with the complete manual on it, which is approx. 120+ pages. It explains how to use the focus correctly and all other features. I've read reviews that people complained that they couldn't focus when zooming, but I was able to take crystal clear images of random items in my living at 30X zoom from five feet away and a beautiful sun setting at 30X zoom. Is the camera the greatest camera ever made...no...is it a great camera for the price if you take the time to read the manual...absolutely! If you're looking for a camera that has all the bells and whistles and will correct user error then enter a price range of $500-$1000 instead of $100-$200.", "Date": "March 10, 2012"}, {"Title": "Bird watchers delight.", "Author": "Allen E. Bickel \"Wildcat\"", "ReviewID": "R12WZ48SYTGMDM", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "Sold my Nikon P500 on Ebay. It was a great camera but the 36X zoom was impossible to control without a tripod. I photograph birds in central Pennsylvania and needed a camera that was capable of taking quick shots while on the move. I had a Panasonic Lumix with an 18X zoom but wanted something a little stronger. The Fuji S4200 meets all of my requirements. I love the simplicity of the contols as well as their locations. Finally got the perfect shot of a tufted titmouse that was nearly fifty yards away. The only things I can gripe about are the location of the card slot which is inside the battery compartment and the strap holding lugs which are too small for a heavy padded camera strap. Did I mention the price which was low enough to counter the problems?", "Date": "March 20, 2012"}, {"Title": "FujiFilm Finepix S4200 Camera First Look", "Author": "king", "ReviewID": "R28TM1W3K32JBG",

Tucker \"Looking for the Best\"", "ReviewID": "R1Z0H7DWSYDPCS", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "As with the other reviewer, I bought mine yesterday at Costco for $179. The costco bundle includes a 4 gig class 6 sd card and a carry case.I have only had a couple of hours with it but I think it is a good value. Depends on what you want it for of course.I changed my old Kodak 850, a similar priced/featured camera because it was giving some issues and the newer cameras offer some terrific technology upgrades. (And I am a Kodak retiree......when I was working Fuji was the enemy!)I specifically wanted a better zoom, with image stabilization. (I have an old man's tremor.) We spend some time in Hawaii during whale season. You really need high zoom if a lot of your whale watching is from shore. We also want Bald Eagle pictures when they land is some trees 200 yds from our house.Another \"nice\" feature for my usage is the option of iso 6400. Also handy is the 1/2000 fastest shutter speed.Several relatives have dslr's but I wanted the zoom without the bulk, and without the expense.I have done some experiments with the 30x zoom. I found I could take sharp daylight pictures at 30x zoom (the equivalent of 500mm focal length) by using the 6400 setting and 1/2000 shutter speed, using shutter priority. I handheld the camera for these. I judged sharpness subjectively on my computer, from the pictures of bare twigs high in trees.The only problem I experienced is that at such high zoom even the slightest movement can take you off your intended subject, same as with a telescope. So in the future I think I will use my walking stick, which has an optional male screw mount and the stick can become a unipod. And of course one can always use a tripod.There is a \"digital\" and \"optical[default]\" zoom selection in the menu. I tried both and the sound seemed similar. I was assuming the digital zoom would lose sharpness in telephoto. It did not seem to do so, as viewed on my computer screen.A feature I like is the fuji-unique \"f\" button. Without going into the menu you can change iso and several other settings, in many of the shooting modes.Some caveats: The largest lens aperture is f3.1 in wide angle and f5.6 in telephoto mode. If you want to take really neat blurred background photos portraits this may not be large enough (to reduce the focus range).another caveat; file size. With my old Kodak I was happy with the 2.1mp (mega pixel)setting. That setting resulted in file sizes in the 3/4 MB range. I have gotten good enlargements up to and sometimes including 8x10 with that mp setting, and that is all I need, so why take up more memory? With the 4500, you only get to choose Large, Medium, and Small for mp settings. On the small settings I am getting file sizes in same 3/4 MB range, maybe slightly larger but certainly under 1 MB.Another caveat: Zoom motor noise in video mode. I like to take a lot of video, editing them into dvds after major family get-togethers. There is some zoom motor noise with the 4500. the good news is that the experiment I did had no voice narration other than my comments. The verbal narrative seems to be much higher level than the motor noise so I do not think this is going to be a significant drawback.", "Date": "March 12, 2012"}, {"Title": "Nice Camera!", "Author": "Shad", "ReviewID": "R88R9B9QVAGHF", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "We were shopping for an upgrade to your typical digital snapshot camera and settled on this at reasonable cost. It has loads of features we wanted such as continuous shooting, easily switches between the eyepiece and rear screen, the body is large enough with enough heft to it that you know you're holding something, even with my huge hands it was comfortable to hold and controls are easily manipulated.Anyone that is familiar with the basics of using a real film camera should find most controls and settings fairly intuitive with no need to spend a week reading the manual.Did I mention that this camera takes really gorgeous pictures for something in its price range? A couple of examples.... we wanted to get some shots of our bull terrier ( Spud McKenzie type dog) in full stride, running with all 4 paws off of the ground, this camera nailed it! In continuous mode you can shoot I believe up to 40 pics in seconds and then go pick out your fav on your computer to portray exactly the look that you wanted. The lense captures detail that will amaze you! A simple snapshot taken of our dog from 10 ft away can be cropped and blown up on the home pc to the point where you can clearly see 1 single hair laying across the corner of his eye in the photo.Another example... while sitting out on the patio, a squirrel ran across our back fence about 60 ft away, we grabbed 2 quick snapshots as he ran with no zooming on the lense... later that day while perusing the pics we'd shot that morning on the pc, cropped and zoomed in on the squirrel and the detail that emerged was shocking in its clarity! Where the naked eye saw a gray blob running on the fence the camera caught up close and personal details of individual markings on his face and body even down to his cheek bone structure and other fine facial details.Other reviews have cited the fact that there is no readily available power source other than onboard battery power to download from the camera to your pc, easily solved by taking the memory card and inserting in your pc! We have literally taken hundreds of pics so far on the original set of batteries.2 minor improvements that we'd recommend would be the addition of a hand grip carry strap to enable you to walk around with the camera poised in your hand to grab a quick pic or 2 and also add a carrying case of some sort", "Date": "October 2, 2012"}, {"Title": "Great point & shoot", "Author": "JibJab", "ReviewID": "R3GQ5E5IFQSWEQ", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "This has been bugging me for some time. This camera has a flash! I've read so many user reviews (and even a CNET review on another similar camera) that chastised it or a lack of flash. This camera has a pop-up flash that is so bright it takes clear pictures in near total darkness (of course at the point you don't know what you are seeing through lcd viewfinder...but still, lets put the flash debate to bed.EDIT: Have since played with the camera more and found that certain modes do not employ flash, and you can't force it to (limited but not included to baby mode (flash isn't great for babies) and panoramic mode where a flash would produce inconsistencies with lighting within the separate frames). The manual suggests you use \"SR Auto\" mode. I don't like that mode because it determines which preset (sport, sunset, night, fireworks, etc...) to use based on surroundings. I just go traditional auto mode. Flash fires without fail.Overall this is a great camera for the money. Remember though, it is a point and shoot. It looks like a fancy SLR camera but is not, so it shouldn't be knocked for quality compared to higher tiered cameras.The only cons I can think of are more nuisances than anything: 1) if you turn the camera on with the lens cap still on, you have to remove the cap and then turn camera off and then back on and 2) forgetting to open the flash, realizing after you've taken the picture that you needed it.This camera is fine for family photos and casual use. For that, it's amazing really. Don't expect to get by with it as your main camera for professional use. Enough with f/stops and everything, it takes great pictures for a point and shoot. With that being said, it may be useful to play around with the manual settings.

It weighs almost a pound, but with the strap - it's fine. Our new Fuji is an awesome, well-priced higher-end camera with lost of features. Only had it a week, but it has point & shoot features for those who are fairly new to digital, plus many high-end features for someone who is really an advanced photographer. I LOVE this camera!! Our Nikon 8 mg, 12x Zoom point & shoot is ok, takes really good pix, BUT - the refresh rate between pix is SO SLOW (5-6 seconds). Even with new Lithium batteries, we've always missed the 'next shot' when we're waiting for the red light to stop blinking. So we looked for a well-priced camera (similar to 'SLR' camera style.) We looked at Kodak, Sony, Canon & Fuji.  We bought the Finepix 4500, as it has the most power in that series! It's only 1.8 seconds or less between clicks, and there's a continuous button near the shutter button that can take a number of pix just by holding the shutter button down. It has scene modes, close-up AND macro close-up; pause so you can get in the picture, face recognition where you can name up to 8 different people, and every time you take a picture, if one of those people are in it, you'd be able to find all the pix with that person by using the menus. Haven't gotten into the details yet, but we took a video w/audio and at 30 fps, it's smooth with very good audio. You can also take a picture within the video and not ruin the original. ONE THING I like to do is zoom in on a picture and take a picture of that zoomed in part, which is usually just pressing the OK button, but we had to look for it in the Fuji. It has it - you just have to choose the picture you want to zoom in on first, then click menu/crop and then you can zoom anywhere in the picture and it will ask if you want to record it. Click OK - the zoomed picture is taken (it won't take a zoomed picture from a zoomed picture, though.) The panorama pix are great, as you only press the shutter button once, and follow the screen - when you are lined up for the 2nd part of the pic, the camera shows a + that turns into a circle, then it takes the picture without you having to move at all then the same for the 3rd! There's still so much to learn. It has blink mode, so it will take 2 pix in a row to make sure the blink doesn't ruin the pic, it can remove red eye automatically, and do some basic editing like turning a picture, resizing, making a photo book, slideshow, etc. etc.  **Don't be confused with the line: Fuji S4200, 43000, 4400 and 4500 - if you go to Fuji.com and search for the Finepix series, they all come up and you can compare them - the only difference is the digital ZOOM (24, 26, 28 & 30). The 14 mp is the same & so is the 3\" LCD screen. You can even push a button and look thru the camera like the old 35 mm with the little window if the sun is too bright.What a WONDERFUL upgrade from the 8 mg we had!! And, after the last few years, we actually paid less for this Fuji than our old digital.My one suggestion would be for Fuji to make a slightly thicker rubber or plastic 'frame' around the LCD so the screen doesn't get scratched if you happen to lay it down on that side.http://www.amazon.com/ and search for Fuji Finepix S4500.", "Date": "August 20, 2012"}, {"Title": "great still camera", "Author": "Bruce H.

This is a fantastic camera, it has the look and quality of the professional cameras, but is easy to use. It does not feel cheap, and is a great size.The 24X zoom is wonderful, and does not make a picture blurry.You can use the LCD screen for pictures, or the view finder, which can be very helpful on sunny days.One of my favorite shooting modes, is the natural light with flash. It takes two pictures, one without and one with flash. It takes a gorgeous photo of person/object in the foreground even with background lighting.The panorama shooting mode is a lot of fun, and the pictures come out great, especially for landscape shots. If you take a panorama shot of something close-up the middle of the picture is a bit fish-eyed.The burst shooting is so much fun! It took me a little while to find it (up next to the capture button), you can hold down the capture button while in this mode and take some amazing motion shots.I am going to be in Ireland for the next four months, and I am so excited to see how this camera performs. If I had to share something I didn't like about the camera, it would be that it is not a compact pocket travel size.

It does - but only if you don't follow the directions. When using the telephoto lens, you have to press the button only half way down so it can focus. Then, press the button all the way down to take the picture. If you do that, the pictures are absolutely wonderful and crisp.

Amazon has the best price.  I've seen lower end models of the same series go for more at local retailers.This camera is great if you want high quality photos.  It has 30x zoom and an \"easy\" mode.  If you are feeling confident you can adjust a lot of settings manually to get a more professional picture.  Great for a family where 1 person knows what to adjust and 1 doesn't.This has all the latest technologies, like auto scene recognition, red eye reduction, face detection, in camera framing, panorama, and photo tagging.  The Panorama mode lets you choose auto or manual.  With auto you line up a crosshair after each picture.  With manual it shows you about 20% of the last picture you took so you can line up the next picture yourself.  You can do continuous shot mode where the camera will quickly take photos.  To make the best use of the camera's speed be sure to get a class 10 SD memory card.The camera has 14 megapixels, but that is worthless.  The average user doesn't need more than 8.  Unless you are a professional photographer or photo editor and are going to zoom in to edit the photos or print poster sized pictures then you can turn the megapixels down to get more photos on your memory card.The camera has a great textured body to help reduce losing your grip.  It runs off 4AA batteries which we wanted.  This way when you are traveling you don't have to worry about charging a battery, you can buy AA's anywhere.The electronic view finder is also great.

I found the manual easy to read and understand (it comes in 3 manuals in 3 different languages)and the camera easy to set up and use.I know the A-900 is basically obselete with cameras such as the S-4800 now on the market, but I am still partial to it.

I am a complete novice to photography, both in technique and in hardware. With that said, let's begin.Prior to purchasing this camera, I tried to do my due diligence in researching it, as well as its competitors. My target was a feature-packed bridge/\"superzoom\" camera with a few advanced/manual options, and built-in flash. The desired price point was $200 or less. When all was said and done, it appeared to be a great choice.The Good:This camera offered a laundry list of features and shooting modes, built-in. Panorama, backlit portrait, night portrait, etc; a lot of nice presets for someone not particularly knowledgeable or skilled in photography. Add in a popup flash, 24x zoom, image stabilization, and other goodies, and you have the makings of a very nice device.The Bad:Even though it boasted a 16 megapixel resolution, the images produced were very grainy. This was true at different zoom distances, lighting conditions, and image capture stability situations (free hand, tripod, standing, kneeling, etc). Of course with the sensor being CCD (as opposed to CMOS), low light performance was tragic, at best. Even fiddling with settings (white balance, ISO, fstop, etc) made virtually no difference when it came to capturing a crisp, clear image.The Ugly, and Unforgivable:There was no flash, period. The built-in flash on this unit was the popup kind. Unlike most cameras, however, opening the flash was manual, rather than automatic (i.e. when the shutter button is pressed). Oddly enough, the flash would never fire, even in modes where it could be used. I discovered via the internet and the extended user's manual (read: not the little mini-manual that comes in the box) that not all shooting modes employ the flash. With the flash option set to auto, it would not fire (no matter how dark the area was where I shot. Furthermore, even with the flash mode set to fire on every shot, it would never do so. The last straw was, even where you set the camera so it had no choice but to use the flash, it seemed to disable the shutter! In short: flash on, shutter doesn't work; flash off, shutter works fine. After doing some more research after encountering this issue, I discovered that a number of others had the exact same experience. Wish I had known that sooner...Conclusion:Again, please take this review with a grain of salt. I am fully aware that there exists a possibility that my difficulties with this camera could have been purely the result of my own ineptitude. However, shortly after returning this item, I picked up another camera of a different brand (which I will not name here, as I'm not reviewing that device or trying to steer buyers toward it). I unboxed it, popped in some batteries and a memory card, and took some pictures. Cleaner pictures, less grain and image noise, and the kicker: the flash just plain worked! That said, I'm inclined to believe that it was the product that couldn't cut the mustard. However, for the possibility that my potential misuse may have resulted in poor performance, I gave it two stars instead of one.", "Date": "June 23, 2012"}, {"Title": "Excellent Camera", "Author": "Happy camper", "ReviewID": "R1PL3837558IMG", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "The biggest reason I bought this camera was the fact it has a viewfinder which I use almost exclusively.

It even tells you if one of your subjects blinked when you take a shot and then zooms in to show you which one closed their eyes. That way you can take the picture again. This is a great feature as I've missed many shots in the past due to people closing their eyes. It also recognizes if a child smiles and automatically takes the picture so you don't miss the shot.

The photo quality is excellent and comparable to a more expensive camera or an SLR.  Fujifilm as always delivers a outstanding product with this camera.

The panorama feature is great and the smile detection, facial recognition, and blink detection are wonderful feature.  The 30X zoom is great a long distance and really lets you get into a subject when you can not walk over there.One of the best features is the 3\" LCD screen and the digital eye piece.

This should be one complete unit and it should plug into the camera; the biggest complaint that I have is the fact that we can't use a filter to protect the lens (also we can't use optional lenses) which is not good if you are using this camera at the ocean or during a wind storm as they get out there in Texas, etc.. The camera is very easy to use and except for when I tried to take a picture of a rainbow, all of the pictures are coming out great even in low-light conditions. I only used the flash for a picture in a poorly lit Church to compare it with the other pictures, no difference. The movie mode is very good also. I shut off the sounds which makes for a very nice quiet picture taking experience. The other evening before the sun went down, we had a full moon not lit up yet and I got some very exciting pictures, craters and all, even without using a tripod. Taking pictures in panorama is very easy and fun to watch but, you can't use the telephoto lens, so you might need to get as close as possible to whatever you are trying to capture.  I have had many SLRs in the past, but for this price range, you can't go wrong. I put a hand strap on mine as I didn't like the neck strap and it makes it a little easier for me to pick up and use. This camera will not fit into your pocket and it does have some weight to it, for me, no problem as I am use to this size and also the larger ones.

I have more than few digitals including some top of the line Canons.This is a great camera for the price. (In fact it would be a very good camera at twice the price.) I was attracted to it because of a very good experience with a much earlier version of a similar designed Fuji. I bought it about 10 years ago. I beat the daylights out of that camera. Even had a set of batteries leak in it. Cleaned it up and it was fine. It looks horrible now. All banged up and I use tape to keep the battery door closed on it. I used it as a \"work\" camera. My work takes me into some pretty nasty environments. But that old Fuji still works today. I wanted something just as good but with higher resolution.The S4500 fulfilled all my wishes and more. This thing is packed with features, many found only on top of the line cameras. Great 30X zoom and 14MP. One key feature I was looking for is the electronic viewfinder. I grew up with film cameras and I still struggle to compose shots with a screen on the back. This gives you the choice of using the bright, easy to see, real through the lens, viewfinder or the built in 3\" display. The electronic viewfinder does a couple really good things for you. For one, using a viewfinder instead of holding the camera in front of you, provides an incredibly stable shooting position. You can take shots at pretty low shutter speeds without blur, much better than you can suspending the camera in mid air so you can look at the display. The second big advantage is hugely extended battery life. That LCD display on any camera, eats up a lot of power. With the display shut off and using the EVF, battery life is incredible. One of my Canons is a very nice Powershot. Great 3\" display too, but no EVF. That thing eats batteries.Now if you are looking for a pocket camera, this isn't it. It has the look, feel and basic size of a traditional SLR 35mm film camera with a motor drive. It's not huge, but it isn't small enough to stuff in your pocket. It does have the feel of a film SLR which is something I find very desirable. That design is not just an accident and it produced some of the best photographs ever taken by film photographers. It is a great natural feel to me, but then I grew up with film.I have been nothing but pleased with this camera. It is very high quality at an amazingly reasonable price. You can easily pay a lot more and get a lot less. All of the features are very nice if you are into photography as I am, but you can just as easily use it as a point and shoot camera and produce excellent photos. It is a great camera for someone looking to advance a bit in their photographic skills. This camera can take you there if you want to, but you don't need a degree to use it either. Use it point and shoot out of the box and then try different features as you go.I have a lot of cameras, and for the money, I'd give this one \"six stars\" if I could. My previous experience with Fuji's tells me they are \"bulletproof\".Just one last note. I would suggest getting a case for this camera. It is big enough that a case makes it easier to carry and provides some protection. The standard Fuji case for this camera is on Amazon for a surprisingly good price.

It does take a long time for the flash to recharge for the next picture. I have owned an older Fuji camera and needed a replacement after a mishap with the old camera. The older one took much better picture than the new one but all in all, the camera in daylight will perform as expected. If you decide to get this, pray you get one that the flash will work on the first delivery or you will have to return it until you get one that flash will work.

Knox", "ReviewID": "R1H0J9DW1RA8Q7", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I have had this camera for about a month now, and am now confident in giving the most honest review. Shipping was fast--I believe there's an Amazon Distribution center somewhere in my vicinity, and may affect that.*Note--The Fujifilm s4000 series are all the same camera, with different zooms. Keep that in mind when you see different views.My Verdict, is that this is a genuine Bridge Camera--and as such, some people will hate it, and some will love it.The kind of people who will love this camera:-Myself. I'm a 22 Year old, self proclaimed Girl-With-Camera. I have had perhaps one college course on Photography, and I know the very bottom line of the technical (shutter, ISO, Aperture, Focal Range) and...quite frankly, I don't really care to worry about these things when I see something I want to shoot. I also know, about composition, lighting, and the more artistic value. Disappointed with a faithful, but still-too-slow Samsung point and Shoot, and a broken Film SLR, I decided, if the price was right, a Bridge Camera would be for me.-Nature Photographers--This Camera performs extremely well in this element. I've gotten pictures in Amish Country of Animals barely distinguishable to the naked eye. (More on this, later.)-A person with some Photography experience, but not a SLR snob.With that said, Some Pros and Cons:-This Camera is insanely faster than the few PAS I have gone through. I have fond memories of the \"Oh I gotta get this picture\" then waiting ten seconds for the \"welcome\" screen to clear. You switch on, its on. It can focus and shoot in as little as under a second. On the Contrary, it still isn't always fast, and that can be an issue from time to time. I've seen it struggle through \"thinking\" for well over 3-4 seconds, only for me to lose the shot.-Its ability to Focus, is still much higher than a typical Point and Shoot. Once it figures out it's \"subject,\" you will find some of the finest details and they are naturally accentuated in the photos. While I'm still working on the \"science,\" it also buzzes out the background, much like an SLR. The issue, is that since focus is automatic (which, is not surprising on any camera under $400), it seems to do whatever it feels like from time to time. I've taken pictures of my nephew in my living room and he is completely \"highlighted\" in some, and blends in the background in others.-Does the thinking for you. No matter what, focus is automatic, and, crucial to your pictures. Let me explain: I have a hard time calling this a point and shoot, because you can't tecnically do that, and expect good pictures. Why? Because the camera, at any given moment, is out of focus. It gives you a \"preview\" screen, but as far as what kind of light exposure, speed, and focus--it does all of this, with a half depress of the shutter (like SLRs). It takes this time to process the scene, find the subject(s), and adjust itself (you will even hear it, and see the screen \"clearing up\"). On a Film SLR, it probably does take about the same amount of time to adjust, and I can't say for sure with a DSLR (I've seen the worst kind of doofuses fire randomly and the pictures turn out half decent).Let me reiterate--your pictures can and WILL turn out blurry, odd, and just outright bad if you do not give the camera time to automatically adjust. If the camera indicates it did not focus properly, it will also likely turn our weird. Imagine someone yells to you \"who is the president\" and you yell \"obama.\" Yes, that's correct, but a more detailed and thoughtful answer is \"Barack Hussein Obama.\"-features, features, and more features. Again, this is a pro and con. For me, I am thrilled that there are 60 different settings toggled ten different ways. Macro in Black and White with flash? Super Macro in Chrome? HD video? What? On top of the Scenes you can select, the no less than three seperate Auto modes, a manual mode, panorama mode, a video mode and all sorts of little nuances I'm still finding--there's also Macro and Super macro. Honestly, I think its awesome--most days. But, when I actually want to be a tad artsy farsty, I have to spend a solid amount of time setting up this, setting up that, putting on macro, opening the flash, closing the flash, going into settings, turning a dial, etc.On a similar note, I would get this camera PURELY because of Macro and Super Macro. I cant exactly get into the logistics. But, what I do understand, is that Both settings, are using the focal strength of the camera in a very small space (so, very close, or very full on the screen.) It leaves a very stylish affect of NOT focusing on anything else aside from fine details of it's target. Macro, you can zoom--I find this to be slightly less detailed as Super, but also very great for shots of one object that may not be right at my nose. It does, however do a good job of focusing on one subject (say, a goose in the water.)-Performs WAY better in certain situations than typical PAS. My Boyfriend has a Canon Powershot which is probably a few months old. I recall, asking him to take a picture of me, and without further details, we will just say the room was dimly lit. They were, atrocious. I mean, like it was mostly digital grain. I thought, okay, it has a hard time in the dark. He took pictures of me during the day...and they were mediocre. blurry if you moved too much, grainy without flash, and flashy with the flash. The \"night time\" pictures pretty much scream \"Hey this was taken with a reaaallllllyyy slow shutter speed, and the person holding the camera is not a tripod.\"I still have issues with motion shots--they look like I'm whirring by, my nephew will have three heads, and...its just gets weird. Also, maximum zoom is VERY unforgiving of a shaky hand. Otherwise, I am very thrilled at how well it handles odd, poor, and good light situations. You can, without a doubt, take some pictures with your own lighting and forget about the flash.In conclusion, I think this camera might just be too confusing/complex for the \"snap pictures of the kids at the park\" types, and too simple for the \"pros.\" However, if you want a decent priced bridge camera with endless possibilities--from the portrait to the natural--I absolutely recommend this camera.", "Date": "April 30, 2013"}, {"Title": "Great Transition", "Author": "Joe", "ReviewID": "R377Y08852XEH1", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "I brought this camera off HSN and really couldn't be happier in my purchase. I have two children and another on the way so taking pictures and capturing the moment is very important to me and my family. At the same time I am extremely interested in photography from an artistic standpoint and wanted to learn more, hands on, but didn't want to spend a ton of money on something I didn't know I was going to like or not. Personally I feel like this camera does a great job for the 'beginner' photographer because it has a megazoom lense and several shooting modes including a completely manual mode. Having the different shooting modes is extremely important for someone trying to learn about photography. This camera does a great job with a transition from an automatic shooting mode to more manual type shooting. The contineous shooting mode is also a great plus for kids involved in sports and other type activities. Although the 'Long period' mode is sluggish after the first four pictures but the 'Top 20' mode is fantastic. The controls are pretty straight forward but does take some adjusting and read but the layout is nice after one has played with the camera for a bit. The electronic viewfinder is an EXTREME plus about this camera because I personally have used it more than the LCD screen and produced what I feel are real quality shots particularly on close ups. The camera also sports a nice look and feel. I know several reviews state that it has a plastic build to it but in no way does it feel cheap or flimsy.In the end I would highly suggest this camera to the beginner photographer and someone who wants to capture family moments who is also on a budget.", "Date": "October 25, 2012"}, {"Title": "Amazing!!! camera", "Author": "christian", "ReviewID": "R16QK3J2S3XTDC", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I bought this camera for a trip to Florida and I was amazed with clear photos and the video quality.

The features and stats were impressive in print, and when I did a hands-on test of several cameras at a store, this camera performed well.I realized that there would be a learning curve for this model (my last camera had lasted over seven years with heavy use, and I've been a photography enthusiast for over 25 years) but it's been two weeks and I cannot say that I'm overly impressed with the images from this camera.Nearly every picture taken requires editing with color correction/contrast and sharpness being the main issues.  I can accept that the sharpness may need tweaking to get the best out of an image, but having to correct the color all the time?  To me, this is not acceptable.  I reviewed pictures taken with my last camera (a Kodak) during the first couple weeks and there were no color issues present.  It seems that the majority of photos have a touch (at the very least) of yellow that is unattractive.  It doesn't matter what settings I use (or if I adjust the white balance), yellow seems to creep in.Photographs taken outside are slightly better.  With editing, the pictures can be extraordinary.  I like taking pictures of trees and clouds, and I was able to adjust the color balances in Photoshop to create beautiful images.This evening I sat down to experiment more with the various settings, and out of 107 photos (of fruit and nature), only 10 were acceptable (and probably would require Photoshop tweaking before sharing).  I didn't expect every photo to turn out perfect since I was experimenting, but for the majority of them to look pretty bad is disappointing.  I suppose it is an interesting point that when I took macro photos of a banana bunch, the yellow was washed out to the point that they looked tan in most shots (go figure, no yellow when it's appropriate).The software that comes bundled with the camera, MyFinePix Studio, is horrible.  I have installed/uninstalled it several times and it still doesn't work.  In fact, it only worked the very first time I used it, and now it puts up a plethora of error messages every time I insert a memory card or attach my iPod to my computer.  I'm ready to permanently uninstall it.Since I have a few more days in the 30 day return period, I plan on trying a few different types of settings, such as taking pictures of animals available for adoption, before giving up on this camera.  It's a shame because there are several positive aspects about this camera.  The panoramic feature is nice, the body of the camera feels substantial and \"camera-like\" in my hands, and the flash responds fast (no lag between photos).  The battery life seems to be very good (I have spent two weeks on the ones that came with the camera.  I've taken around 500 photos on these batteries).I hope that I can quickly figure out how to eliminate some of the problems I've had with this camera so that I don't have to return it.", "Date": "August 11, 2012"}, {"Title": "It's a Fuji, but better than my last Fuji.", "Author": "Mixed", "ReviewID": "R37QFV6XA9R3E1", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "While I am basically happy with this camera, love the panoramic shooting and the 24x zoom is great. (Note: about 24x is probably about as far as you might want to go in a compact or bridge camera without a tripod) Actually with my current DSLR  and its kit lenses I get more zoom with my Fuji.  If you do not shoot with a DSLR this will be a step up from your compact camera and has both a wide variety of automatic and manual modes (especially good if you want to learn more about photography without the expense of the DSLR) I tend to take the Fuji places where I am unwilling to take my Olympus DSLR like on my kayak and when I go bike riding, etc. However, it lacks the color depth and richness of my Olympus.  It also has a tendency to overexpose,as I saw with my last Fuji, especially skies above darker tree lines.  There are two ways you can combat both negatives.  Since I am shooting in active situations I tend not to use the manual settings unless I need to control shutter speed, instead I use Program mode and shoot -.03 to -0.7.  The other thing you can do is choose the Chrome setting in the menu and what this basically does is up the saturation and contrast, you must be careful about using program and chrome modes together because you can end up with an image that is just as flat because of saturation as you can with an overexposure. (Which in a side note kind of reminded me of Fuji films back in the day) With this said I rather work from an over saturated image and lighten it, if I need to, than try to bring some color back to a sky or highlights.", "Date": "September 25, 2012"}, {"Title": "great camera, great price", "Author": "KST", "ReviewID": "R22RYO89008SDW", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "This is a fantastic bridge camera for the price.

I have only owned regular digital point-and-shoot cameras in the past.  With the recent birth of our son, we wanted to upgrade our camera to something better.  We looked at SLR cameras, but even the cheapest ones were more expensive than we were willing to pay.  We decided to get a \"bridge\" camera, and after pouring through reviews and feature lists we decided on the Fujifilm S4200.With both my wife and I being novices when it comes to photography, we wanted something that would take excellent pictures on Auto.  We are very pleased with the picture quality on Auto, the pictures are much more clear than any previous camera we've owned, and the flash is excellent.  Pictures taken with flash look great and don't have that blown out look that photos taken with flash do on cheaper cameras.  This camera is very intuitive and easy to use- the options are there if you care to delve into them, but if you're just looking for a camera that performs well out of the box, this fits the bill as well.I've taken close to 100 pictures over the last few days and the batteries are still going, so the battery life seems decent.  The camera itself is pretty light, and we really like the grippy textured rubber on the outside of the camera.  Pictures in low light and indoors are good, and it also takes pretty decent photos with the flash off.  The camera takes pictures fairly quickly, I think its about 3 or 4 seconds between shots which is pretty good judging by reviews I read for other cameras in the same class taking upwards of 10 seconds.  The 24x zoom is excellent as well, very cool feature.Overall I would definitely recommend this camera, but keep in mind that my wife and I are novice photographers and are just judging the picture quality and performance subjectively.

These types of camera's known as \"Bridge\" Cameras have built in Zoom lenses and for some reason the camera company's are putting in zooms that are so high power you can't even get a good photo unless you're on a Tripod that weighs 10X what your camera does  (shake rattle and roll is NOT good). I've found that it's best to only use half of the zoom magnification...anymore than that and your image quality goes down. S4500 is easy to use and it can give you images that will \"knock your socks off\" spend a little time searching YTube for reviews and then when you buy, search again for photography tips so you can get the most from this (or any) camera.Pros:Easy to learn and useAA BatteriesISO 64 !Film Simulation (ie: Fujichrome Velvia color balance !)Easy Macro (Close up and Super Close up) with the push of a buttonGreat  Auto FocusAdvanced users can set everything to your hearts desire, EXCEPT manual FocusAuto Focus has multiple settings:  Average, Spot, Continuous, and a user defined spot that's easy to access and VERY accurateAuto Exposure is tied to the Auto FocusPRICE and VALUECons:No Hot Shoe for a flash (no shoe at all)Viewfinder and LCD screen aren't super high resolutionHigh zoom magnification = lesser quality imageNo lens thread...can't add filters or lens hoodVery Noisy image if under exposedNoisy image above ISO 400 but still okI HIGHLY recommend this camera.I'll post some images", "Date": "December 12, 2012"}, {"Title": "Very Good Camera for the Money!", "Author": "Thomas A.

This camera is very easy to use: you can basically point and shoot, and the camera does a very good job of compensating for your bone-headed mistakes. You can use some bells and whistles to make particular types of photos look better, and I do recommend that you actually read the manual before using.2. Quite light weight. You will of course get better overall results with a tripod, but I have so far never used one, and am quite pleased with the quality of most of my photos. Stationary bird photos look great--but take numerous photos of birds in flight to increase your odds of capturing a great shot! I'm also quite pleased with the color in fall foliage/landscape photos.MINUS--1. If you are planning on taking lots of long-range photos, a camera with a more powerful zoom is definitely in order. Most shots I take are fairly close-in to mid-range, and this camera is great for that work.2. Battery life is somewhat shorter than I'd hoped--so carry extras in the field to avoid disappointment. In the camera's defense, I do take lots of photos each trip.3. A minor quibble--you were probably planning to buy a chip for added photo capacity anyway, and I highly recommend the Transcend 16 GB memory card!

WRONG! This is a great camera even at $150 assuming you are coming from a lower resolution point and shoot as I was(Sony DSC-W1 at 5MP and excellent in it's own right). 14MP is amazing for this average joe of a photographer.Today I went to my local arboretum and took some greenhouse flower and outdoor landscape photos in diminishing afternoon light. All handheld and when I viewed them on my PC at home I was extremely pleased with my results. Very crisp photos with great detail and color saturation even in natural light. As expected I could not focus in these light conditions at maximum focal length but that is the limitations of this type of camera that incidentally does not allow you to zoom or focus manually. Most of the 24x zoom range on this camera should be reserved for outdoor conditions. The image stabilization works very well and you can get away with hand holding it if you're just looking for a useable image otherwise bring the tripod along. It does however have a neat function in SP mode called \"Natural\" that will expose one image without flash and one with with one press of the shutter. In most cases I was most happy with the no flash images. The flash is intelligent and does a nice job of matching the amount of flash output to the existing natural light. I really like the fact that you must manually pop up the flash so it will not fire unless you want it too.The user interface is also user friendly if you take some time to familiarize yourself with the user manual which is available on the cd or as a pdf download from Fuji's site. I found this camera's menus much easier to navigate than my Sony DSC-W1's. There are plenty of options for the more demanding user as well as the Auto and Program functions that works surprisingly well for most situations.So why didn't I give it 5 stars? Two reasons. The first one is that you cannot use this camera for any purpose without removing the lens cap. Since they began putting such large displays on these cameras I would really like the ability to review my photos without taking off the lens cap. The second is the LCD monitor. My Sony has spoiled me. When it was introduced it had one of the largest LCD displays available at the time and is fairly clear even in moderately bright light. I got into the habit of checking each photo after taking it. The S4250/4200's LCD is low resolution for it's size as well as being very difficult to see in anything but indoor lighting conditions. I am not comfortable with having to wait to go indoors or viewing on my PC to check my photo's condition, even though my results were surprisingly acceptable.As I said earlier this purchase was a gamble. I was researching superzoom cameras for an upcoming trip to Alaska and the price for this feature set seemed like a great bargain and too good not to investigate. I pulled the trigger knowing that I might be disappointed but if so I could return it and continue my search, which is not something I normally do. That said, I am definitely not disappointed in this camera but I will be returning it for these reasons and purchasing the Fuji HS25EXR, which has a brighter LCD and allows me to turn the camera on without removing the lens cap. The CMOS sensor, 2MP extra, longer zoom and manual zoom/focus doesn't hurt either! Hell,it's only money!NOTE: This review is meant for the more casual and budget conscious photographer and the high rating is meant to reflect that as I feel that is Fuji's target audience. Please do not respond with technical evidence to the contrary as that will only confuse me.

I did a lot of research online and comparison in stores... all other cameras with the same features were $320 to $600+, and many of those had broken buttons or error messages or something. Weird, I shot only Nikon film SLRs back when and they were the best, period. But Nikon digitals have loose wiggly buttons and feel cheap and plasticy across the board. Just sayin'.24x optical zoom. Fast, too. Though even with dual stabilization, it's almost impossible to get sharp handheld photos at high (9+) zoom.Lightweight yet solid. Control buttons are well-positioned and give you a nice solid click.EVF for tracking moving subjects, composing shots in high ambient light, etc.Aperture priority, if I want shallow depth of field.14mp! Sharp photos with incredible detail.Accepts high capacity SD cards... a 16gb card holds 2352 pics at max resolution.Takes excellent macro and supermacro photos.You often can't tell from the lcd or EVF, but sharp focus.What I Don't Like:TOO MANY OPTIONS!!! It's maybe nice to have them, but you set the ISO or color saturation in one mode, and it doesn't transfer when you shoot in another mode. And who needs all that Facebook stuff and in-camera editing when you're going to download onto a computer anyway?The manual (pdf download) is nearly 150 pages long! Many of the subjects are not well explained (ie: in what on-camera menu can I find it this feature?), and some are not addressed at all (ie: overlaying 3x3 grid to aid in composition and vertical/horizontal alignment)The LCD is REALLY reflective, it's difficult to see with all the glare. And the brightness control is on the third (out of five!) page of the tools menu.EVF is too small, and the eyepiece is HARD. If you are panning or zooming, the EVF view is jerky.Exposure compensation: +1/3 is almost enough, but +2/3 is way too much. WTF?*****COLOR BALANCE skewed toward yellow, especially in outdoor natural light. Blues are fine, greens are excellent, reds are kind of off, orange is gold, pink is too hideous for words... envision red wine and bananas in a blender, you get the idea. Everything looks like I'm taking pictures as the sun is exploding (What would be the  point? Who would be alive to see them?) I tried pretty much every possible combination; the most realistic is with white balance on \"sunny\" and STD color... but still very imperfect.  I could overlook just about everything else, but this one really pisses me off! Gonna spend a lot of time with editing software. Grrrrr...Contrast is a little too sharp. Whites and light colors tend to be washed out and lack detail at +1/3... yet at zero compensation, scenes are too dark overall. WTF??Multi AF mode is a misnomer- it chooses ONE focus zone (NOT multiple) out of many possible. Kind of pointless.. you want to take a photo of 2 horses in a field, and only one is in focus?? Seems to choose the same two on the upper left side no matter what the subject, too.AA batteries. Yeah, alkalines are available anywhere... but you'll need NiMH for any kind of decent battery life. That's an extra expense for the batteries, a spare set, and the charger. A proprietary rechargeable battery would have been smaller and lighter to carry in your pocket, and much MUCH cheaper.Edit: One more thing... it took me literally 5 minutes to figure out the battery configuration the first time... there are stamped + and - battery icons stamped into the plastic, but they are so incredibly shallow and flat black on flat black as to be unreadable even held under a lamp with a magnifying glass! Add to that the two small phillips-head screws that look like plus signs and are next to two battery slots, exactly on center... sheesh! FWIW the two outside batteries go in head first (- exposed).Nitpicking:Textured righthand grip and rubberized lens barrel make it easy to grasp... but it's still a little small for  my hands, and there's nothing to hold onto on the left side. The one I tested in a store didn't have ANY texture on the grip, so I don't know if it's a \"normal\" feature.Center pinch lens cap is hard to grip.Neck strap is MUCH too short for a tall person, with the provided neckstrap at max length the camera sat between my nips, also the camera can (I tried it) come off the slippery nylon straps if pulled.Battery/memory card door is tricky to open, you have to pull it while holding the latch unlocked. And unless you set the camera upside down, batteries are in danger of falling out when the door is open.Slow to save to memory card... with a class 6 card, you still get about 2 seconds of lag time and black screen as it saves the photo.End result? I SO regret buying it. I blew some gift cards on it, so the the expense wasn't too bad, and now it's too late to return. Wish I had waited for a used Panasonic FZ35 (I recommend Panasonic Lumix FZ and TZ series)to show up somewhere.***Edit comments: I've gotten closer with the color problem by custom white balancing in full sun, on the side of light gray stucco house... I would call it cinderblock, or maybe even light pewter. Which makes completely no sense; balancing on a surface that's more blue than yellow ought to INCREASE yellow saturation... I first tried balancing on some light tans and beiges, then the photos were more yellow/orange than ever. Completely backwards! Anyway, resulting yellow-to-red spectrum is much nearer to realistic now. Blues seem a bit over-vivid (this is all in \"standard\" color BTW). Some brighter greens (tree leaves) are good; however muted greens like sage or olive are the correct tone but too dark; that could be from the CONTRAST/exposure problem I described before and am still having. There is no way at all to tone down contrast when shooting.PLUS, the on/off button is starting to stick.

A viewfinder is a must (for me) when zooming.  The button to switch to viewfinder on the S4200 is out of reach with one hand.  The viewfinder also doesn't have a focus (needed for people who wear glasses).  The camera is a little heavy (because of the batteries) and the grip is a bit too big.  The pics ae a bit grainy (noise) especially if zoomed.  The 'panorama' setting is cool.

We purchased ours on a whim from Wal-Mart in March (the S4250 Wal-Mart variant).  We got it just a few dollars cheaper than the Amazon price ($199) at the time, plus it included coupons for 100 free 4x6 prints at Wal-Mart, so it seemed like a reasonable deal.  I've been able to do a lot of things with this camera that our previous point and shoot cameras could not do.  You can change the fstop and shutter speed to get some great lower light night shots.  I did a time lapse of an incoming thunderstorm one night in August and came up with a pretty good video, you could make out a lot of details and of course see the lightning flashes.  Also, you can buy an adapter tube and put on additional filters and lenses.  The only downside is that if you use a telephoto lens, it doesn't play nice with the autofocus.  Your best bet is to get either a really, really high quality 72 MM or larger telephoto lens, or just invest in a DSLR camera without autofocus if you want to use a telephoto lens. But even so, with some patience you can even work out nice shots with a telephoto lens.  My favorite attachment is a variable neutral density filter with 2-8 stops in tandem with our adapter tube and UV filter.  With these items I can produce some great images in all weather conditions.  The neutral density filter is particularly useful this time of year, when there is snow that can oversaturate an image, or if you want to get a shot with a slower shutter speed on a bright, sunny day.  Altogether we have around $320 dollars invested in this camera, and despite it's limitations being a point and shoot, it produces high-quality results that are comparable to more expensive point and shoots and DSLRs on the market.

The deciding factors for me was the 24X optical zoom, the use of AA batteries and the inclusion of the view finder on top.  I just wish it had come in red like a few others.  Before my camera arrived, I downloaded the owners manual and read all.  It is nice to be able to review details at my computer.  The small basic manual in the box gets you started but to fully enjoy all the functions the downloaded version is a must.  My previous digital is a Kodak easyshare with HD and 5x zoom, that I have been using and enjoying for the past 5 years.  After a trip to Yellowstone/Grand Tetons I realized 5x zoom didn't cut it and that I would look for a new camera.  I will still take the Kodak at times I need to have one to pop in a pocket when taking interior shots of our rental properties but for travel and family pictures the Fuji has everything I want in an upgrade.  I have been taking a number of test shots mainly outdoors in various light and this zoom is like having binoculars!  If I steady my arm I can get zooms with little blur.  I am so happy that it has the view finder as it helps not having to look down esp. in outdoor sunlight.  The overall size and feel is great and basic shooting in Auto is a snap.  I have a lot to learn and try out when it comes to features and the menu.  I was documenting a flood damage at one of our units with the Kodak and in the middle of it the battery went dead.  It has been frustrating as it gives no warning. I know that with the Fuji I can just pop in new AAs and continue.

I read up some on the internet and found that at least the S4xxx series cameras seem to have this issue in common.  The cameras will lock up and indicate the lens cap is still on, there is no real solution other than to return the item and either try again or get your money back.The camera has some nice features and is reasonable, although if your going to take a chance on a Fujifilm camera the S6800 is only $40 more and has a CMOS image sensor and still uses AA batts and the S8200 is even better at additional $70.  But this camera came as a bonus from my employer so my choices were limited.I don't like the fact that the camera doesn't have a eye piece view finder and uses only a screen viewer.  It does use AA batteries has a nice zoom, if it works.  The primary reason to like this camera is the use of AA Batteries, which in the superzooms is getting increasingly rare.  I won't buy a camera that uses a proprietary rechar-batt system.  Canon is so bad that not one of it's camera uses the same battery system, each one uses a different battery model...and disgusting and anti-earth feature.  I use AA rechar-batts which is much more green.The movies seemed a little on the bright side, but I didn't have time to mess with the controls prior to it's malfunction.  The microphone worked well and the control are well placed, at least as well as the Canon SX10 IS.  The shutter speed was ok, not real fast, but it was faster than the Canon SX10-IS.Conclusion:  If you are going to take a chance on a Fujifilm camera try the S6800 or S8200 the money is only a little bit more, but the extras, such as SMOS image sensor and 1080p movie and superior fast shutter make it more than worth it.RG-JT", "Date": "October 24, 2013"}, {"Title": "Fine pix s4200 is fine", "Author": "bill", "ReviewID": "R1H0Z8XOVD00SE", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "the price was right combined with the carrying case and sd card.It takes  wonderful pics and the zoom is awesome the best feature is having a view finder that you can actully put your eyes to which makes for faster locking in of your picture and a much better framing of shot.", "Date": "October 3, 2012"}, {"Title": "Read this update.

I really wanted to love this camera, but this one too went back to Costco for a refund. I don't think I will buy Fuji digitals again. If you do buy one, better make sure you can return it easily. Choose your seller wisely. UPDATE 4/2012: After very careful comparison shopping I ended up getting a Panasonic Lumix DMC-FZ47. I'm very satisfied/happy with it, and feel I have a high quality camera now. It was top rated in bridge cameras at CReports and other very favorable reviews at dpreview.com.. Though it's more expensive I feel it's worth it.

Provonchee \"Cricket Boy\"", "ReviewID": "R238J9SPX90J24", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I just received this camera today and am totally amazed at it.  What kind of camera of this type could you expect to get for only $150?  I didn't think it would be any good but it is really fabulous.  Setting up the camera for initial use was very quick and easy.  The display on the back is nice and bright and clear and has an adjustment so you can have the display even brighter for use outside.  I found the eye level viewfinder to be nice and bright and clear.  A few reviewers said the ELVF wasn't very good but I don't know what they are thinking.  I have owned a number of different digital cameras, including some that cost over three times the cost of this one, and I haven't seen a better ELVF anywhere.  The 30X lens is a great range.  I wouldn't go bigger than 30X and smaller could be okay but 30X is just right, as Goldilocks said.  The camera only has two aperture settings but that makes no difference at all.  The camera adjusts the shutter speed to give correct exposure at whichever aperture setting is in use.  I find 14 megapixels plenty for any use.  I just took a number of pictures both outside and in with excellent results.  I wasn't sure how good the image stabilization system would be but it seems to be excellent.  I handheld several shots at maximum zoom and the pictures look very good.  I took one picture of some hostas in broken sunlight (some in shadow, some in light) and the exposure and color were both perfect.  I also took a picture of the lower section of a capital building dome, showing the pillars under the dome, and the shot was perfect.  Several shots I took at maximum magnification of high objects, statue on statehouse dome, weather vane, etc., all look superb.  They look like I was standing right beside them when taking the picture.  All the camera's controls feel very good to me and fall naturally under my fingers.  The lag or lead time between pictures with this camera is the best I have seen on any camera.  It only takes about one second between exposures!  I have tried the flash and movie function and they both work very well.  The flash is nice and strong, moreso than many other digital cameras I have used.  Speaking of movies, I have taken panorama pictures with other cameras but can't imagine when I would anymore.  If you take a movie of the whole scene the viewer can see everything in great detail.  If anyone wants to download the full manual for this camera, they can find it at: http://www.fujifilm.com/support/digital_cameras/manuals/pdf/index/s/finepix_s4200-s4500_manual_en.pdf  Overall, I have to say I am wonderfully surprised at the quality of this camera and its very low price.  I look forward to years of excellent service from this camera and can't believe what a bargain it is.  I think anyone who wants a bridge camera (this type) will be very happy with one of these cameras.", "Date": "August 23, 2013"}, {"Title": "Good Camera Overall", "Author": "MajorD", "ReviewID": "RNMFEYPWOMIAX", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "Great camera, especially at the price.  We looked at numerous other cameras, but narrowing it down to features 'we' wanted and were looking for, we chose the Fujifilm FinePix S4200 Digital Camera.  14mega pixels are nice, especially when you're using the 24X zoom and want to zoom in on the pictures later.  The other feature that is our favorite is the panoramic feature; it couldn\u2019t be any easier.My only complaint is the shoulder strapping system leaves a lot to be desired; I don't know why they just don't use a Velcro system, as the buckle and weave kept pulling loose/off from the camera at certain angles/tension.  So, during a dog sledding excursion, I lost the lens cap, which is looped through the shoulder strap \u2013 the strapped worked its way loose again, and then there went the lens cap.  Another point in time I had the camera over my shoulder and I went to go move it off to the side and it slid right off the strap, and BAM! hit the floor.

This camera is terrible for night pictures and low light. While using the manual functions, it often only give you the option between F2.2 and F8, which doesn't offer enough control. You need to use the pre determined functions in the camera to to access the different apertures, but you have no control over them. When you take pictures in low light situation, you absolutely need to use the predetermine functions in the camera.

A camera this nice, for this price? No way. But as I continued to search through the information, I found it was really a top notch, as-good-as-it-gets-for-a-digital piece of technology. It has 14 megapixels (it could be better, but oh well) and an amazing, controllable (no tripod necessary) 24x zoom. How nice is that, for the unbeatable price of 149$ (what I got it for, prices change)? I was looking to upgrade my nikon coolpix L23, which is a good compact camera, but I needed a little more to pursue photography.So I put my money down and bought it, taking my risks with the questionable price. I also purchased a case, 2 tripods, and a strap.When it finally arrived, I was overjoyed. Not only did the package include a camera, it included 3 instruction manuals, a lens cap, a strap (I guess I have an extra), 4 AA batteries (requires 4), and a CD with more instructions. The camera does have some weight to it, so I would highly recommend a strap. It came with a full package that was not even mentioned, which was even more for my money! Talk about a good deal!But the real tests were the quality of the pictures. So I went out into my yard and began to shoot, and found the pictures came out even better than I could have guessed. I still haven't figured out all the settings, but I haven't read all the instructions, either.The only thing it didn't come with was an SD card, which I thankfully already had, but it's needed. I have 32gb, and I haven't run out of memory still, so the pictures don't take up enormous amounts of space.This camera is a great deal, and has had no problems.

It has manual settings that might be able to overcome some of the short comings, but for a point-and-shoot I didn't want to have to take the time to find just the right settings and miss the perfect shot. It turns out that the perfect shots are not so perfect. Using this camera indoors it often has trouble focusing and the colors seemed washed out. Outdoors in the evening taking videos, it did okay when there was enough light until I zoomed in. It was not able to compensate for the low light level when zoomed. It also takes some time to focus when it is zooming in. Overall, the image quality is not all that good. It looks and feels like a well built camera but doesn't live up to my expectations. The menu system is easy to use, and all the features that you might want are there. The lens is great and the 30X optical zoom is its best feature. It does give you the choice of LCD or viewer, but I tend to use only the LCD. You can't have both at the same time however. I was unable to download pictures and videos using the Zeikos USB card reader that came with the accessories kit, so I had to use the USB port on the camera. That worked really well. The only minor drawback is that it does drain the batteries. But the accesory kit came with a battery charger, so that was no big deal. I like that the camera uses 4 AA batteries and can be set for NiCad, NiMH, or alkaline types. I use the NiMH batteries except for when they are charging, at which time I put in the alkalines. This keeps the date/time from resetting. One nice feature is if you forget to remove the lens cap when you turn on the camera, it gives you a warning on the LCD screen and you have to turn off the camera and remove the lens cap to get it to turn on. Perhaps if I tried to use the manual settings I might get better quality pictures. I am not aware of any ability to adjust the settings in the video mode.

I did take photography, and do know the basics. We are on a tight budget, and I wanted something other than a standard point-and-shoot, so I opted for a bridge camera. My first \"bridge\" was a Nikon Coolpix 8600 back in 2001 which ran me $700.00!After much research, I decided on this model. I haven't had it long, so I will be updating this review again soon.Initial take: great size and easy to hold/handle. Fairly easy to maneuver through the menus, so long as you read the FULL manual which you have to download. (These manufacturer's are getting too cheap to even bother putting the full manual in with the product anymore)!Quick shutter time, and ability to catch your shot quickly even though it seems there is a lag.Disappointed in the fact that this camera does extremely poor in low light situations on auto setting. I was taking indoor photos at our local pool which had plenty of natural and flourescent light, but this camera refused to take any shots on auto below 1600 ISO. Therefore, the shots were horribly grainy, dark, and slightly out of focus. Take the camera outside, it is overcast. Again, I use auto setting, and again, plenty of natural light. The camera decides to take the pics at 800 ISO, which for the lighting conditions seemed overly high to me. Again, photos were blurred and grainy. I used the P setting instead, and bumped my max ISO setting to 400. At this time, the photos seem to be FAR better, but there are still some issues with low light situations. Being I am familiar with cameras and their functions, I can probably adjust the shutter/ISO and aperature to my tastes, but of course this takes away from the ease of a \"point and shoot\" where I want to use one.I will be experimenting this week with this camera, and see how well it performs in all situations. If it fails to meet my needs or seems to be too much a hassle to deal with, it will be going back to Amazon.

The flash is not very powerful and unless your subject is within 8 feet of you in poorly lit areas the camera will struggle to take bright photos. The maximum aperture for the lens is 3.1 at wide angle, so the camera is not the fastest thing out there. Most of the other big name brands with super zoom bridge cameras also have a maximum aperture of around 3.0, so this camera's performance is not out of line with the competitors.

I needed a camera that would work well in low light and capture action shots.  That is not an easy list of needs to fill without spending hundreds of dollars.  My son plays ice hockey and this camera is perfect for the conditions inside the rink.  Too often my old camera had too much of a delay and I'd miss the shot.  Other cameras don't work well enough without a flash to capture the image.  (Can't use a flash when standing next to the glass.)  This worked well for both being fast enough to get the shot and adapted to the low light situation present in some rinks.  I have also taken great shots of outdoor lacrosse games - so high action but lots of light.  I have gotten many great shots of our pets both lounging and in action as well - inside using the flash.This has turned out to be a fabulous over-all camera.  Lots of setting to serve many needs but not so many that the average user will be overwhelmed.  I haven't used the video part of the camera much but it seems to be okay.My only gripe is that the neck strap fell off after about two weeks of use.  Might be I didn't get it on properly, but now I am strapless when using the camera.  Not a deal breaker and fortunately I was holding the camera when the strap came off so no damage done.I was reluctant to purchase a camera that used standard AA batteries because I had read somewhere that they are inferior but I don't find that to be the case with this camera.  While I like the convenience and savings of the rechargable camera batteries - I also like the convenience of being able to toss regular batteries in the case as my back up.  And if I forget the replacement batteries, it is super easy to drop into a store and pick up a pack.I have used this camera for about three months and gave it five stars because it can't be beat for the price.  I'm sure a more expensive camera could do better but I really can't complain about this one.

Parker", "ReviewID": "R1BIIYTMBULQHA", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I purchased my Fujifilm FinePix S4200 at Target for $179 back in January 2013 and it's worth every penny.  I'm not a professional photographer nor do I want to be.  The S4200 has a lot of nice features housed in a great-looking package, and I'm discovering more of them as I go along.  I mainly use my camera for taking cityscapes, statues, family/friends, wildlife at the zoo, and anything else that captures my fancy.  Plus, it saves a lot of time when taking pictures of my own artwork and uploading & editing is a breeze.  This camera beats any scanner I've ever seen or used.  What I love most is that the S4200 isn't complicated and it meets my wants, needs, desires, and budget.  Fujifilm makes great products at reasonable, down-to earth prices & the S4200 is yet another example of this.When I do decide to upgrade, I'm definitely keeping it within the Fujifilm family.  Most likely, it will either be an S1000 or the HS50 EXR. Even when this happens, I'm still hanging on to my S4200 as my \"go-to\" camera when I want to travel light.I have two suggestions for anyone wishing to purchase this camera:  Go ahead and spring for the Energizer Ultimate Lithium batteries because they'll last a lot longer than any other AAs (and you'll buy a lot fewer, too) and don't bother registering with the My FinePix website because it's far more trouble than it's worth.  Whether you're a beginner or you're looking for a reasonably-priced step up from a compact digital camera, the Fujifilm FinePix S4200 is a great camera at a great price.

It takes crisp, clear pictures without a lot of noise (I'll upload them once I find the cord), the color looks true, the optical zoom is fantastic, the face-recognition is kinda cool, and the flash doesn't leave a glare or strange shaddows, the video is fine as far as I can tell (haven't put it on the TV yet), it's easy to use out of the box, the battery life is impressive, and, for its class (read, not $1,000 + DSLR), it beat my expectations. It's nice and heavy and the hand grip is comfortable.My only issues are the shutter speed (a bit slow, the sony didn't have that problem), night shots (go for an Olympus SP-620UZ for amazing night shots), and auto-focus while in macro (which I'm sure requires more practice time with the camera).", "Date": "March 25, 2013"}, {"Title": "Still Testing..

I bought this camera because of the reviews for great macro photography. I resisted the urge to start playing around with it before reading the manual. I read it first yes almost all of the manual. Then I turned it on and went through the manual again this time with the camera in hand to check out all the controls. I have a lot of time on my hands fortunately.The camera takes really awesome macro photos. No kidding! My brother is a professional photographer and I showed him the photos and he said \"for a novice you take good photos\" I was tempted to take credit for it but NAW I just showed him the camera. lol.. It works great for what I bought it for. It also takes pretty good photos in the right settings. The zoom is almost unbelievable for a camera this price range. Just make sure you are not zooming on something thats close or it will not focus. Yup I tried... The flash works too contrary to the reviews I read.That said. The camera does feel a little flimsy until you insert the four batteries it uses and them BAM it feels a lot better. It is easy to use if you know how to read so I recommend READ the manual.I couldn't find any reviews regarding the memory and I tried it with 500mb (4 speed i think) and 16gb (10 speed) and both worked awesome. Only thing I noticed was the video allowance went up from 2 mins with 500mb to 9mins and a few seconds with the 16gb therefore size of the card matters not so with another GE \"dslr\" i bought and returned.It didnt come with the lens strap and I contacted customer service and they resolved that issue without any hassles at all. Awesome customer service.I think I about covered everything I experienced so far. I will add the last star when it lasts up to a year as my nikon, and canon point and shoot have. My verdict?

I take pictures of our horses and need a good quality photo along with being able to have the zoom when I need it most. I will say the zoom isnt as good as I thought it would be by watching the video review (which is what sold me on this camera). I wanted more reach across a pasture then what it gave me. But what can you expect for a cheaper camera? I am familiar with digital cameras and was able to take this one out of the box, put in the batteries and my SDHD card and started shooting right away. This camera in my opinion does so much better in a (light condition). The subject is not as clear and seems grainey in darker rooms (window rooms). After I found that out I went and took some pictures of the horses. I LOVE action pictures and took one of the horses eating out of the round bale and you could see every particle of hay flying in the air!!.. which was amazing to me at a 24X zoom. I have had trouble zooming toward objects behind another object (as in horses behind fences), the camera I had always targeted on the object in front and I hated that... This one in auto will target what you want which is very helpful!! This camera to me is def. a $200+ camera. The HD video is pretty sweet as well. Very clear BUT don't like that you can't zoom while in video recording mode, as some digital cameras will do. I will say I haven't really shopped around and bought this one pretty quickly when I seen the specs and video review... I know I have some negative comments about this camera but it truely is a great camera for the $!! I have to remind myself that those cameras that I need are over the $1,000 range..

I was surprised that this camera was perfect with the automatic settings and two 100 watt daylight fluorescent screw in bulbs. No special setting needed. Very little Photoshop adjusting to do.The other reasons I wanted this camera was the ability to do movies and it seems to do that. I only gave it a quick try. 14 megapixels was a shock. Large files but great detail. I love that is uses regular batteries. In a pinch, in the field and you need new batteries you can buy them anywhere. I use rechargables and always have an set ready to go.I use a tripod to take pictures but the camera seems to have anti shake and all of my pictures were sharp.This camera is plastic which makes it lighter than my Dimage.It does lots of things and would probably be great for taking pictures of people. It does close-ups and that can make it fun.IT DOESN'T COME WITH A SD CARD! So you will have to buy one. Be careful as this camera won't work with the Extreme SD cards.

So far so good, it's smaller, much lighter and much much easier on the batteries.  My biggest gripe about the S7000 was battery life.  Every time I took it out I had to make sure I had a pocket full of batteries.  When the S4200 arrived a stuck in 4 alkaline batteries to test it out.  I've since shot about 500 shots on those same batteries which to me is amazing.  The battery icon still shows plenty of juice left.I'm still learning the features and settings but it offers a lot of options.  The lens is impressive but note that you will need to steady the camera when fully zoomed which is to be expected.Remember this isn't a $1000 SLR so don't expect it to act like it.

I did in fact drop the camera -- about 6 inches total from my hands to the kitchen counter.  This had the effect of killing the pixels on the viewscreen in about a 1 cm diameter right where you need to see to focus.  The pics it took were still good, but the big black circle on the viewfinder made taking pictures a little more challenging.Fast forward to the S4200, which I got despite my prior experience.  My wife and I had the unit for about 3 months before the shutter button (which also acts as the zoom control) snapped off.  The button is cheaply made plastic and held on to the unit with 2 thin plastic rods.This will most likely be my last fuji camera.

It is a really nice point and shoot and makes her feel like a real photographer as its body is shaped similarly to a DSLR.  The lens does not come off (which I knew already).  The best thing about this camera as far as imagery is that it takes AMAZINGLY detailed macros.  My expensive DSLR cannot take photos as sharp as this can. I actually steal it once and a while to take macros of insects.In indirect sunlight, where the sun is either behind or somewhat to the side, this camera takes gorgeous photos.  The colors come out great and I love that you can use the viewfinder or the screen.  The viewfinder view IS digital though, which is kind of odd to look at at first.  If the sun is in front of you there is not really a good way that I have found to compensate for over exposure and therefore things may be blown out.  But the beauty of digital photography is that you can see the result right off so you can try again.The worst thing about this camera so far is the strap.  This is an important problem even though it may sound trivial.  The strap is what keeps the camera from falling and smashing on the floor!  This strap is USELESS.  The second time that it let go around my son's neck (he has one too!) I threw the strap away and got one off my old Minoltas and rigged it up.  The little metal brackets that hold the strap in place are very narrow so you have to have some kind of adapter for it.  I used yarn tied tightly for my daughter's and then another camera strap that had metal clips on it.  Don't even try using the one that comes with it as it only takes one time for a camera to hit the floor and break inside.In all this is a great stepping stone for climbing up the ladder to a DSLR that gives you some user control over your shots but is still lightweight, portable, and versatile.", "Date": "November 27, 2013"}, {"Title": "Love it!", "Author": "Barbara G Anderson", "ReviewID": "R2P3UAWKFQ4PJX", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I researched many cameras before going on our trip to Colorado and Yellowstone National park this past September.

I almost expected the L26 at $107 to be marginally functional, but the SX30IS was more like $500 and I anticipated a good camera at that price. Wrong. I figured I was rolling the dice by ordering the S4500 at $160, but the reviews were reasonably good.Likes:The Fujifilm S4500 has a fairly good f-stop of 3.1 at minimum zoom, which produces great photos in low light situations. So far, nature photos are sharp and clear, even when the subject has a distant background. Portraits are particularly fine. The many functions are easy to understand and use. I've only spent a few minutes with the owners manual since most things are intuitive, assuming you've used a point and shoot before. The 30X optical zoom is great as long as there is plenty of light. You can't beat the price when it comes to this type of camera.Dislikes:I purchased a 16 GB Class 10 SDHC memory card for still shots and a 32 GB Class 10 SDHC for HD video. For some unknown reason, there are 9 minutes and 41 seconds available for HD video recording no matter which card is installed in the camera. One of the main reasons I purchased this model was to take an HD video of my daughter's wedding (or at least of their vows). I'm a bit disappointed with these results. A firmware update from Fujifilm was ineffective. I have a support ticket now to find out why this is happening. Hopefully I can determine how to double the video recording time before the wedding.Overall, I am very pleased with the camera. If I have to choose a lower video resolution for the wedding it certainly won't be a deal breaker.

The camera is quiet when taking pictures and I absolutely love the zoom lens. I also captured some photo's of a baby deer which just made the camera that much more special to me. I would recommend this camera to anyone who wants quality photo's. One of the things I would suggest is that you watch the video that one of the other raters compiled. I'm sorry that I don't remember his name but I am sure you can find it. He did an excellent job explaining the way the camera worked and I was able to just take the camera out and start shooting.

I haven't learned all this camera will do yet (have had it less than a month). There are 2 cons that I have found so far. The first is it doesn't come with a rechargeable battery. Even though the 4 AA batteries last a fairly long time (long enough for several hundred photos), I probably will get weary of having to constantly buy batteries for it. Looking into rechargeable ones and hope that takes care of the problem. The 2nd con is the battery well is often hard to close. For some reason I have to try over and over until it finally clicks. I don't know if it's this particular camera that has the problem, or if they're all like that. It is not easy to close.

I got this camera on Saturday as an early Christmas present from my roommate. I had been raving about wanting a Nikon, but since I'm new at this I thought a not so expensive starter camera would be just fine. As I get better I hope to upgrade to a nikon dslr.  To start it feels really good in your hands. Not cheap, but not too heavy. Easy to turn on and fast which is great for suddenly deciding to take a picture. It is not difficult to figure out how to use the wide variety of controls and photo variations. It comes with a strap and lens cap. The strap isn't the best, but it does its job. I carried it around with me on Saturday taking test shots of random things, the pictures came out really well considering it was raining.

It also does not do so good in low light as I always find the photos come out grainy and when I do turn on the flash It is too bright.

And the date stamp would not set properly.In addition to it not working, here is my take on this camera if it had worked properly.  I probably would have returned it anyway.  It feels cheap (it feels like one of those old film cameras that are lightweight and plastic...and I understand they are trying to make it lightweight and all, but really?) and is poorly designed.  The compartment that you put your memory card in is also where the batteries are housed.  So every time you open the compartment to put in or take out the memory card, the batteries fall out.  And, it is not a one handed operation; the compartment is not easy to open; you have to use your fingernail to open it which results in a broken nail.  I am sure the engineers that designed this camera are not photographers; and maybe have never used a camera before.  It is as if they tried to save space by putting the memory card with the batteries, and then said \"oh, poo! since the door is going to be opened a lot for the memory card, we should make the latch extra sturdy there!\" ... which results in it being very difficult to open.  Now, this might be fine for someone who puts a card in, goes on vacation, and takes hundreds of photos before taking out the card.  But, if you are like me and need to take only a few or several at a time and take out the card to view it in Photoshop, you are going to be highly frustrated.Also, I think the problem with the time/date stamp may be because whenever you take out the card, and the batteries fall out, the camera prompts you to put in the date again when you turn the camera on...every time...which is annoying....but it would not let me put in the month and date, just the year, and then the month and day showed 0.The problem I had with the zoom, was it would not move at all when I was trying to focus for a shot...so I would look at the camera and try to figure out if I was on the right button (which I knew I was) and then it would just randomly start zooming.  And then get stuck there, and not \"un\" zoom.  And then I would MISS the shot :/I sent it back and got a Canon EOS Rebel T3I.  Which is more expensive....but it works....and will work for a long time which will avoid having to spend more money in the very near future for a new camera.  Which definitely was defeating the purpose of trying to find a moderately priced great camera....which this is NOT a great camera...IF it worked it might have been a good camera at best.The problem with color...yes I read the other wonderful review about color balance and inside colors looking yellow, etc...and yes it does....and it looks very grainy....I get better photos on my old IPAD!  Seriously!  You can adjust the color balance, but it is just so off the begin with!  I understand photography a little and thought I could handle it, but it is a pain!  On the plus side, if you are only going to take photos outside they are pretty good...unless you are trying to zoom...and the zoom does not work...like mine.So, if you are looking for something \"up\" a level from a point and shoot, kinda like a really good camera but with training wheels, if you want to try this one, go ahead, Amazon has a great return policy...but in my opinion....Save your money.  Save up for something a little bit better that has had good reviews for a long time.For the good part of this review.  Amazon was incredibly wonderful with the return.  I went to my account, clicked on return, told them why (without all of this detail, just the zoom was not working and the date stamp was not working), they emailed me a return slip to put in the box, and scheduled UPS to come to my door to pick it up.  I did not even have to put a label on the box, UPS had the label when they got here.

After spending some time taking photos, I began to wonder.  I now see that many of the reviews listed for this camera are actually for different models.I purchased the Fujifilm S4500 with 30x zoom as an impulse buy during a sale.  I am replacing a 3 year old Panasonic Lumix travel zoom (12x) which no longer takes sharp pictures due to dust sucked into the lens.I primarily take photos of my cats (indoors) and outdoor scenery and animals (mountains, ocean, birds).  I need a camera that works indoors and outdoors.  I want a camera with good automatic settings that I don't have to adjust.  The AA batteries and option to use a view finder appealed to me since I like to take photos on long camping trips where I don't have access to electricity.My first thought taking the camera out of the box was 'This is cheaply made.'  On the upside, the camera does feel good in my hands.  I like the sticky, rubbery gripping surface covering most of the camera.  It makes it much easier to hold.The battery/SD compartment door is difficult to open, however.  It also looks like something which will break within a year or so given the flimsy looking hinges and the force needed to open it.I find the lens cover aggravating.  You have to pinch the edges, set it just so inside the lens, and let go.  If you have it in the right spot, it will snap to the inner edge of the lens and stay in place.  For some reason, I'm having a very hard time setting this right.  I would prefer a cover built into the camera that automatically opens or closes-- or a cover that twists or snaps on top of the lens, rather than inside it.My iPad takes sharper photos than this camera does.  With my iPad or Panasonic, I can see individual hairs and whiskers in my cat photos.  Even when the picture is not blurry, it has very little detail.  Even though this is a 14 MP camera, the pictures look as if they are designed for low-resolution web display.  The camera comes with two automatic settings.  I've tried both, and neither improve the sharpness of the photo.Another big problem is that the camera does not seem to focus well.  When taking photos of a picture on a wall or a vase with flowers, with no zoom, the image is blurred 60% of the time.  When using the zoom, the blurring is even worse.I tried taking some photos outdoors this morning in sunlight and still found that the camera did not focus well, even when taking a still life. Forget trying to take a clear photo of something that moves or breathes.I do not think this camera is worth even the very low sale price I paid for it.

I bought a FUJI Fine pix S4500 for my husbands birthday, here are his words;I love my pocket digitals, but because I have a Mamiya large format and a Minolta SLR 35 mm I have a hard time reconciling their limited use. Don\u2019t get me wrong, I used the hell out of the 3 or 4 I had, but I just took snap shots with them. You can\u2019t compose or take \u201cphotographs\u201d with those minis. The Fuiji Fine Pix S4500 is a remarkable entry-level camera at about $150.It gives features like manual aperture and speed which in my humble opinion is more than necessary for composing photographs. One of the other outstanding feature is the way Fuji handles the \u201cMacro\u201d feature. (I take a lot of close ups of flowers, ants, bugs and anything that scurries along the ground). And I like that it uses batteries instead of a charging system.I\u2019ve had my S4500 for about 3 weeks now and keep discovering new features that just astound me.

While most lay people consider this camera \"outstanding,\" professional photographers have not been so kind, saying it's just so-so as digital cameras go, and I have to agree the pictures aren't really better than what I (occasionally) got with my older Panasonic Lumix. There's a learning curve involved here and I still haven't quite mastered it. The camera seems a little slow to respond, and doesn't like being rushed. That being said, this is what I really like about the Fuji S4500 and why I'm happy with it:  1) It has both a viewing screen and a view finder. Lord, I missed having a view finder, especially for outdoors on a sunny day, but also when I'm trying to frame a telephoto shot.  I like being able to steady the camera against my forehead; 2) It feels good and substantial without being very heavy; 3) You will not accidentally take flash pictures while in a museum rousing the anger of the security guards since the flash has to be raised before it will work. That feature alone is worth the price of admission!!; 4) While not the easiest of cameras to use, the controls are a lot more intuitive than on my other camera, where I was always forgetting how to proceed; and 5) Once you get it right, it takes some awesome shots. If I had the $$ for a digital SLR, I'd go for it, but otherwise this is a decent alternative for the $150 or so price tag.

Since it was still under warranty, I returned it to Fuji to have it fixed. That was a horrible experience. It was returned to me with an invoice that didn't tell me anything that they had done to it. I had to call to find out that it was indeed looked at and fixed. I turned it on at home and took 2 pictures to \"test it out\", loaded it into the camera case and headed out to a big event. We get to the venue and the camera won't turn on. I tried to turn it on a few times during the evening with no luck, and then about 3/4 of the way through the night, it turns on again and works. 2 days later, it won't turn on again and now appears to be officially dead.

It's impossible to get really sharp images under any circumstances, which makes the whole 14 megapixel thing kind of pointless. The pictures are not awful but pretty much at the point and shoot level, what you would expect from a $50 camera maybe. It gets much worse once you start zooming since it much less forgiving to camera shake because of lousy image stabilization technology. I have a five year old Canon superzoom (12X) that is only 8 megapixels that produces images that are far shaper than anything I got out of the Fuji.Exposures are not very accurate and lean toward overexposure, with slightly washed out images. You can clean them up using photo software but virtually every image is off. White balance seems OK. Low light shots are very grainy, pretty much unusable. Camera is a bit on the bulky side but not too heavy. Bigger than most of its competitorsIn the end, however, this thing is unbelievably cheap  ($140 on sale) given the feature set, which makes it hard to trash it entirely.

Sport shots were lost entirely as it would take forever to take the photo after hitting the button.  Moments lost are moments lost forever.

New batteries in and it took another 20-30 shots, no flash, and a quick glimpse of the lcd screen showing the battery light again, and poof, the camera shut itself down.

It has an amazing zoom that will knock your socks off. But there's also some not so amazing things about it. For one, it requires you to fully power up the camera, including removing the lens cap, when you hook it up to your computer to transfer files. So instead of an actual USB mode, which EVERY camera I've previously owned has had, this one requires you to fully power it up, remove the lens cap, potentially get it dirty while the display runs at full bright white. Annoying as heck and ultimately is potentially damaging. The other thing is the macro mode. Do NOT buy this camera if taking close-ups is a major thing for you. It just really sucks at that. The auto-focus is so completely non-functional in macro mode that the mode might as well not exist.NOW, having said all that, if you want a camera with a really good zoom that takes good pictures of people and the countryside, this does that very well.

Think of this camera as a point-and-shoot with better optics. It does have optical zoom, which is a good thing, but the CCD is clearly pretty small (not sure how small, but surely nothing close to a 35 mm frame).  Of course, the cameras that DO have large CCDs are $1000 or more.  So my disappointment is that this LOOKS like a real camera, but it isn't.Anyone who has studied the Megapixel wars knows that it's an invalid spec.  This camera may have 14 Mpixels, but I'd say the image quality is worse than the last Canon camera I had (which sadly broke) that had only 6 Mpixels.  It's really overall a bad thing.  A camera with 14 MPixels takes giant images (file size is giant) but the quality is not there.  So essentially you are wasting hard-drive space or clogging up your e-mail with files that are probably 5 times larger than they should be becauseof the empty magnification.  This camera is loadedwith features to try to get the best shot if you don't know anything about photography, but if you DO know something,it's frustrating.  I tried to use aperture priority mode, which should allow you to set the aperture and have the camerachoose the shutter speed to get the shot.  This is useful when you want to control depth of field.  On this camera, aperturepriority only allows F3.5 (wide open) and F8.  I was disappointed that you could not have anything in between.  I think it'sbecause it's really not for serious photographers.  So ... if you are one ... save your money till you can getsomething that you will like.", "Date": "March 4, 2013"}, {"Title": "Fujifilm S4500 Compact Digital Camera", "Author": "Leonard", "ReviewID": "R2FPL6H0FMW37R", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "Purchased as a gift for our son and he simply loves the features that the Camera provides.

I currently order a small Fuji and it has always worked well.I received the camera and got it all set up, took a couple pictures to check out the zoom and to see how it looks. I then put it back in the bag because I bought this camera for vacations and other important pictures. I got it out about a week later to read and understand more about this camera and the batteries were dead?? I replaced batteries and reset up the date and time, etc. Went thru the camera and the manual. Put it away. Was getting ready for vacation so I got the camera out to make sure it was ready and again the batteries were dead. I called Fujifilm and they didn't know what was wrong with the camera and told me to send it in. I took it on vacation first and then sent it in to be fixed. I bought this camera in July 2012 and sent it in September 2012. Now I get a note saying the parts are not under warranty??? Most all products have a year long warranty. VERY DISAPPOINTED and will never buy Fuji cameras again.", "Date": "October 15, 2012"}, {"Title": "Booo", "Author": "andy yoon", "ReviewID": "R3TUG2QTM0BSG1", "Overall": "1.0", "Content": "Poor thing it didnt work at all when i tried to take pictures at the pool and at the park", "Date": "September 17, 2013"}, {"Title": "Buyer Beware - Very Poor Quality!!!", "Author": "Pen Name", "ReviewID": "RBVA5HVJOURJN", "Overall": "1.0", "Content": "Camera was much lower quality than I had hoped.

I guess I was naively thinking that this would be like a DSLR camera and take amazing photographs. I was wrong. This is like carrying around a giant digital camera, so basically, if you have a decent digital camera, just keep it and don't waste your money on this Fujifilm. I just decided to go for the splurge, even though I wasn't sure, and pay alot for a DSLR camera because that is what I ultimately wanted. I bought the Canon Rebel T4i, and I am NOT disappointed so far.

I taken several hundred shots, may be more.  Their's a lot of thing to figure out!  The flash doesn't work all the time, especially when you what it too, you'll have to wait or just take another picture with no flash, and then take one when it decides to flash.  The camera on my Iphone takes some better pictures in many cases.  This Fuji Camera take some pretty good ones as well, some come out even better then my Iphone.  I guess I'd have to say, after writing this review, and thinking about it! that this  Fuji Camera isn't really worth bothering with, at least for me.  The reason I say this is, it's so much easier to point an shoot my Iphone, it's always in my hand anyway.  The picture usually come out just as good, if not better then this Fuji Camera.  I bought this Fuji Camera to take better pictures then what I already have, but it's beginning to sink in my head, that maybe it's just to much effort.  I can't stick it in my pocket, and I have to be really careful with, this Fuji Camera, and it not all that easy to hold.  You have to wear it around your neck, and if your doing something like changing your baby boy's diaper, and you have no safe place to put it down, well you just have to make do.  Like wearing it around your neck, and my boy grabs it all the time, very frustrating!

I bought it one day and took it to Europe the next with little knowledge on how it worked.  I had no problems with the older camera on that trip as it was very easy to figure out how to use the settings and it took fantastic photos!  When the knob broke off days before my vacation last month I had a panic attack as I wasn't up on the latest cameras and little to no free time to go camera shopping.  When I saw there was a new generation of the FujiFilm I have owned for 5 years, I decided to buy it given how happy I had been with the original FujiFilm that I owned.  When I opened the box and powered it on, there was a thick white line down the middle of the display on the back of the camera so I called Fuji tech support.  The person I spoke to quickly informed me there was nothing that could be done.  He said it was damaged and to return it!  He did me a favor with his advice.  I was actually disappointed at how flimsy the new generation of this camera had become.  The case is cheap plastic and I feel strongly it could easily crack without much trauma to it.  My old camera was well made and held up after many trips in which I took hundreds of photos each time. I packaged the new camera up and sent it back to Amazon the next day.  I ended up with a Canon PowerShot SX500 IS which operates much the same way as the FujiFilm I originally owned.  It is constructed of much heavier materials and takes terrific photos.  I would recommend the Cannon as it's well worth it.  I was very disappointed in the FujiFilm camera.  If you buy it you won't be happy.  Holding it in your hands you can tell it's cheaply made and probably doesn't have much of a lifespan.  I feel badly that I'm writing this review after owning the older model which I absolutely loved, but I felt I needed to so no one else makes the same mistake, especially if they are in a time crunch and need a camera quickly.  This is not the camera you are looking for.

Manual, i compared it with several cameras.. and this is very manual you can adjust a lot of things, like aperture, shooting time, iso, you can play with this options to create great pictures... you arent limited by the scenes like \"fireworks, beach, night scene\" you can create your own scene depending in what you want... you can get a lot of effects... i am a fujifilm s4000 user, and this camera its the same, just have less lcd resolution, and the texture of the case... i cant stay quiet and knowing that there is people watching this camera and doesnt know what they can do, or why this is better than others cameras like l810...so if you are an amateur, pro, or you want to learn more about photography i think this camera will help you, has a lot of manual settings... and 30 x zoom! perfect for baseball, soccer games... to make a movie zooming the players, taking moon photos.this camera has an electronic viewfinder... very usefull in sunny days... very nice, i think you should try with fuji... i read a lot and bought s4000 3 month ago, im very happy... try fuji!", "Date": "April 2, 2012"}, {"Title": "Out of box DOA", "Author": "Allegro Winds", "ReviewID": "R9KA1AA1XGWP", "Overall": "1.0", "Content": "Bought this camera as a S4250 from Walmart.
