{"Reviews": [{"Title": "How do you improve on the best? See the TG2!", "Author": "Eric Slay", "ReviewID": "RO9WPT8RTKG18", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "Let me start my review with some background information. I've been a professional photographer for the last 10 years and a digital-camera enthusiast since they started becoming available. I shoot with heavy, bulky, expensive equipment when I'm working, but when I'm having a good time with my family I look for something a little different in a camera.Right now, most of us have phones that take pretty good pictures when in good light. The problem with phones, and other point-and-shoot cameras is that you can't get in on the action very well as you're using them. They're fine if you want to be the one who's on the sideline trying to get the people having fun to look at you.If you're like me, this isn't good enough. I take pictures for a living, so the last thing I want to do is take more and miss out on all of the fun moments with my family.  This is why I have been snatching up the \"tough\"-style cameras every year in search of one to love. After owning several Canons, Nikons, and even waterproof housings, last year I finally found what I felt was the *perfect* take-anywhere camera: the Olympus TG-1. Over the last 12 months, I have really given it a beating and it's still working perfectly. In fact, last month I just got back from a trip to the Great Barrier Reef where it took some of the most incredible pictures you can imagine.Of course, when I saw there was an update to my beloved TG-1, I knew I had to have one. Fast forward to two weeks ago and my package arrived. Since I've rambled a bit on my intro, let me just summarize my thoughts after giving it a good dose of summer for two weeks:Clearly, Olympus took everything amazing from the last camera, improved on it, and then added a handful of incredible features that I didn't know I wanted but now have fallen in love with!---Here's a BRIEF SYNOPSIS about what I LOVE:Solid construction. This is no toy - it's the real deal and it feels great in my hands.The lens is in the center. This keeps your fingers off it and makes it easy to hold during the action. (This is also a bonus for lefties!)The user interface is intuitive. Unlike some other cameras I own, there is nothing buried in the menus.  Plus, nearly everything you need is right on the dial.I love the strap. It's thick, adjustable, and bright red. If you drop this on the ocean floor like I did, you'll be happy for this.The battery compartments have double locks. First you lock it, then you lock the lock. This keeps you from nervously picking it open underwater and keeps your kids from doing it on accident.The screen is big, and I find it's even visible in bright light and underwater through goggles.The lens goes really wide. This is great to add drama to things, but also just to capture a whole-lotta fun in one shot. I get more group action shots on this than I do with any other camera.The camera location tags your pictures with its built-in GPS. This is an awesome combination to Adobe Lightroom. I just import my pics and they're distributed on a world map. It's awesome to see all the adventures we've had this way.The camera shoots fast. At full resolution, you get over 5 frames-per-second, which is the same that I get with my Canon 5d mark III. If you lower the resolution, you can get an incredible 60 FPS! And, if you need more than that, see below!---Let me tell you about some of the NEW STANDOUT FEATURES for me:1. 240 FPSOne of the features I love about the TG-2 is the ability to shoot video at 240 frames-per-second. Yes, you read that right. Just think of all the money you'd save from buying a $120,000 Phantom HD camera!All kidding aside, being able to shoot in this super-slow motion mode is incredibly fun. In fact, the other night my family spent hours making all sorts of videos with this camera. The kids would do crazy dives into the pool, we had watermelon eating contests, we did skateboard tricks, threw water balloons at each other, etc. and after each video was taken, the whole family would come running up to me and the camera and watch in amazement. This kind of fun is what life is all about. We had a great summer evening being together and just having a great time. The movement, facial expressions, impossible poses, and the things that happen too fast to catch in real time, were captivating to say the least.There are two caveats with this feature which I think are important to mention. 1. There is no sound. This is because it would be slow-motion sound and would be too slow to even sound funny. This is why when you see the slow-motion videos on the internet, they're always done with background music. 2. The video resolution makes them tiny. You definitely aren't going to play these on your huge TV, but they're great to watch in a window on your computer.2. Aperture Priority ModeWhen I shoot professionally, I use AV mode on my Canons. The previous TG-1 did not have the ability to set the aperture, but the new one does and it's a welcome addition. Because my shooting style is more fluid and from the hip, I'm ok with letting the camera choose the shutter speed based on the aperture I want and this is doubly so with a camera like this. When I switch over to the A mode, I do it to blur the background and make the subject stand out. Because this camera goes down to f/2, I can get some pretty decent results from it, especially when zoomed all the way in on my subject. For example, when I want to take a poolside pic of my daughter, I can blur the background a bit and diminish the distracting fence and signs in the background.3. Super-Macro modeThe Super-Macro mode is phenomenal. In fact, this is the first camera that can shoot all the way up to a tiny 1 centimeter from the subject! It's literally MICROSCOPIC! In this mode I was able to hold the camera right up to my eyeball, snap a shot, and see every little detail and pigment in my eye. A more practical way I've been using this feature is for the watches and other items I sell on eBay. It really adds value to my listings (and winning bids!) when I'm able to post close-ups of the watch dials to give the buyer confidence in my listing.Another way I've been using this mode is with my children. We've been running around the house (and park, and tide-pools, etc) and photographing everything small and making it BIG. From hermit crabs to rolly-pollies, my kids love getting right on top of something and \"blowing it up!\" Most recently we've been playing a game where they take the camera around the house, shoot an item, and then run back to me and have me guess what it is. It's been great fun and of course I don't have to worry about them breaking the camera.---SHOOTING MODES: (most are the same from the TG1, but there are a few differences)iAUTO - Camera chooses the mode based on the sceneProgram Auto (this is what I use mostly) - Like iAUTO, but allows you to make changes to: flash, macro, self-timer (12 sec, 2 sec), exposure compensation, white balance, ISO, sequential (1 fps, 6 fps at 12mp, 60 fps at 3mp), and photo size (megapixels).Scene mode - Changes modes based on subject. This is a great way to ensure you get the best picture you can without having to rely on auto-mode.The choices are: portrait, beauty, landscape, hand-held starlight, night scene, night portrait, sport, indoor, self-portrait, sunset, fireworks, cuisine, documents, beach & snow, snapshot, wide 1, wide 2, macro, pet mode -cat, pet mode -dog, snow, panorama, backlight HDR.If you shoot a lot, it should be pretty easy to speculate what settings each mode makes. For example, sunset mode bumping up the saturation on reds, purples, yellows; fireworks mode using a longer shutter-speed to get light trails; beauty mode using a softer focus, neutral skin-tones, etc. This being said, I have no idea what the difference would be between cat and dog mode. If you figure this out, post it in the comments!Magic mode - Here you can take Instagram-like pictures in real time, seeing the effect as you shoot. Many of the effects even work for videos as well.Pop art - oversaturated colorsPin hole - vignette, like an old cameraFish eye - simulates a fish-eye lens (really fun!)Line - drawing turns the picture into something like a coloring book pageSoft focus - like old school glamour shotPunk - turns pictures pink and black (actually more fun than you might think)Sparkle - simulates a star filter, which turns any points of light into stars (great for Christmas lights or city lights)Watercolor - mutes the colors, adds line (see `Line' above)Reflection - like a kaleidoscope (my kids favorite)Miniature - simulates a tilt-shift lens. If you haven't heard of this style of photography, Google it. Super fun, and something I use for landscapes when I hike with it.Fragmented - like a shattered mirrorDramatic - processes pictures with a \"grunge\" lookC1 and C2 - These custom modes are incredibly useful. If you find yourself dialing in certain settings for situations you encounter often, you can just assign those settings to one of these 2 modes on the dial. For example, my brother-in-law likes to examine my nephews pitching on the 60fps (3mp) mode so he has assigned these settings to the C1 mode and just remembers that C1 mode is \"Zach's Pitching Mode.\" Now when he takes pictures during a game, he can just flip over to the C1 from iAUTO mode whenever Zach pitches. Super-useful!-----BONUS! Here are some UNDERWATER PHOTO TIPS from my experiences:As far as underwater pictures go, this camera performs wonderfully. Colors are bright and accurate both above and underwater, and the contrast is excellent for an underwater camera as well. This being said, let me give you some tips on getting the best shots.1. Just like with regular photography, 12 noon is the least desirable part of the day to shoot. A good rule of thumb is that the further you get from noon, the better the quality of light. Another way to think of it would be the closer to sunrise/sunset, the better the quality of light will be.2. Even though you are underwater, there are better angles/directions to shoot in. I haven't been able to come up with a rule, but when you get into the pool, test an underwater shot from each direction and you should be able to see which looks best.3. The camera has a coating on its lens designed to keep drips off when you're playing in the water. I can't tell you how many pictures I've missed on other waterproof cameras when there was a drip that obscured the subject of my photo. This being said, here's a tip that has helped me get a 100% success rate in the pool: I just dip the camera in the water and peek at the lens. If there's a drip that has managed to stay on the coated lens, DON'T wipe it with your finger - just blow it off. Because of the coating it'll slide right off---CONCLUSION:As you can see, I'm thrilled with this new addition to my camera line-up. The Olympus Tough line has proved it can take a beating and this new model has taken what I called a *perfect* underwater camera and made it even better.In my group of friends, I'm the guy everyone comes to when they want to buy a camera. When they tell me they want a point-and-shoot, I love it because it's an easy answer: the Olympus TG-2.If you found my review helpful, let me know! I'd be more than happy to answer any questions you have about this camera or any general photography questions as well.", "Date": "August 12, 2013"}, {"Title": "Fast lens, great point & shoot pictures, but video has unwelcome noise", "Author": "jvdg27", "ReviewID": "R14STAXYKLD2DK", "Overall": "3.0", "Content": "PROSFast lens.  Probably the single most defining feature of this camera as compared to other waterproof options available today.Takes pictures immediately when you press down the shutter.  Very responsive.Built very well.  Bigger than some other waterproof cameras, but feels much more sturdy.  I like the trade-off.Looks nice.  Red color is dark, perhaps crimson.  Nicely done.Compartments lock, just like the TG-1, so as to ensure no unwanted openings.Picture quality is excellent for a point and shoot.  Lower light photos are okay.  I shoot most low light with a DSLR, and this doesn't really compare, but it is better than the average point and shoot camera.Flash is quick.Menu/screens are nicely done.  Easy to navigate.  That can't be said for all waterproof point and shoot cameras.  Olympus has done this well.  Viewing screen is pretty clear, too.  I like it.Ability to take it anywhere.  This alone has merit.  But there's not much use in taking a \"lifeproof\" camera places if it can't keep up to some minimum standards for photos.  The 2.0 lens really helps allow light in for low light situations, and it is exceptional for snapping photos right when you want.  Not two or three seconds after you press the shutter.CONSVideo noise.  I bought the TG-1 two separate times.  The first time I thought there might be an issue with the unit I had.  The video was noisy and had a ticking/jack hammer type sound.  Not sure what it was.  I returned it and gave the TG-1 another chance.  Second time--same thing.  Major bummer.  Hoping the TG2 would be better, I bought it the first day it became available.  The TG2 has improved upon the video noise issues, but hasn't eliminated them.  It's like there's a small buzzing sound in the background while you record video all the time, and then there are select moments when there's more noise, probably due to the camera trying to autofocus.  I'm not sure exactly how to describe it other than saying that there are electronic vibration noises when the camera tries to focus.  Sounds kind of like a little mini star wars laser war.  .Zoom in/out during video.  Just avoid it.  The sound is overwhelmingly unwelcome and annoying.  Some cameras have incorporated silent zoom (or what I would refer to as mostly silent zoom) while recording video.  Not this one.  Would have been nice.Other observationsSize.  It's really about the same dimensions as the TG-1.  Was hoping it would be smaller.  Actual dimensions might indicated 0.1 inch smaller in the depth dimension, but I can't notice it.Sensor.  Not sure there's much of a difference between this sensor and the one from the TG-1. It's supposedly a newer sensor, but I am not able to discern a difference in the photos.  Both seem to do fairly well.  I wouldn't worry much about it, but don't expect much of a difference.  There may be some change in the lab or scientific measurements, but real life it appears to be the same.Better than the TG-1, at least from the standpoint of reduced noise during video recording.  But the main issue which made me return the TG-1 is not improved upon enough for me to keep the TG2.  I'll admit I'm very picky.  It may not bother you, but it's noticeable enough for me to return it, find something cheaper (this is close to $400 - really ought to reflect more refinement with the video), and wait for the TG3 or a comparable competitive camera.  Would be nice if Nikon or Canon or Panasonic would come out with an bright/fast lens waterproof camera.The only real downside / achilles heel I see to this camera is the video issues.  If I were just looking to keep it for stills, it would be a home run.", "Date": "February 20, 2013"}, {"Title": "Small upgrade in quality, big upgrade in utility", "Author": "MRN", "ReviewID": "R37CWYKXNJ1QHF", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "I have used a (highly reviewed) 10MP f2.8 Canon SD790 from 2009 for the past few years, and have sought an upgrade due to common issues with such small point-and-shoot cameras (1) effects (vignetting, blurring) from lens aberrations that were especially noticeable in landscape photography (2) fragile construction. There have also been many circumstances when I have not been able to use the camera due to moisture or excessive dust during outdoor activities.(Note: Before discovering the TG series, I was convinced to buy either the Panasonic LX7 or Sony RX100 for sake of their extremely high image quality.)Photo Performance: small but noticeable upgradeAt first glance, the SD790 photos seemed to be better with bolder colors and better definition. But on closer inspection, the difference is only due to a lower average exposure on the SD790, and higher processor contrast. Carefully analyzing small leaves and tree trunks, the TG-2 does show much more detail. On 0% zoom, test photos do show some pixel distortion in the 4 corners of the shot, but zooming in a tiny bit (about 10%) is enough to remove the distortions from your shot. Low light photos give great colors, and the f2.0 lens is way better than most cameras, but the noise level will never be DSLR quality; head to the Sony RX100 or bigger if that is your priority.I have not used the super macro yet, but professional reviews claim it is very good.Add-on Lenses: extra expensive plusThe two extra lenses are probably not quite worth the $110 each, considering that you also need a $20 adapter (I recommend 1 each). They are both small, high quality glass. I have had very satisfying results with the teleconverter, which should be most useful for shots taken from a fixed location (sports, performance, cruise) but is of course not as useful as a normal zoom lens. Because of the heavy lens vignette, the camera must use it's maximum optical zoom (4x) to use the teleconverter. Thus any further zooming uses digital zoom only. Minimum zoom shots are 100% equivalent quality to the best non-teleconverter shots, but at higher zoom.  From that point, further digital zoom still looks nice, but naturally collects noise. If you want a variety of shot composition options, you will have to quickly take the teleconverter off, and switch the camera mode back to normal. This is easy and quick, but not seamless, about 5 seconds.The fisheye lens has a mild fisheye effect, and confers a wider-angle as well. No intelligent thoughts on this one yet.Extra Features: this wins itIf you're going to pay the extra cash for this camera, pay it for the extra features. You can pull this out in ANY situation, at ANY time (rain, snow, boats, dust, rocks, children) without fear of destruction. Seeing how much my SD790 has aged (lost screws, creaking case) and with stories of zoom failure in extended dust exposure, the value of a sealed case (and sealed zoom) is more than underwater novelty. There have been many awesome experiences in the past few years that I was not able to capture because of moisture, dust, etc. Despite that security, my only fear is that the lens glass will be scratched even though it is recessed. The GPS tagging is also a blast to help you relive your adventures in the future.Big picture:If you're looking for a small point and shoot that takes the best possible photos, don't buy this (get something cheaper and smaller).If you're also considering mirrorless or larger cameras for the variable lenses and sensor quality, don't buy this (get something cheaper and larger).This IS a camera for the adventurer/outdoorsman/chronic klutz that is also a discerning photography enthusiast. Without the lenses, this is a camera that you can use in absolutely ANY context without fear of destruction. You will get shots and videos that you could never consider with any other camera. Adding the expensive lenses into the package puts the camera into a strange limbo category that is well above any expensive point-and-shoot camera, but below any cheap mirrorless camera.Personally, for my interests in extended outdoor adventures, quality + low-light photography, and creative composition (teleconverter + fisheye), this is an excellent camera. But I have definitely paid a high premium for that flexibility.P.S. The two main reasons to purchase this new model instead of the TG-1 is (1) aperture priority mode to take advantage of the f2.0 lens (2) improved super macro mode.P.P.S Comparisons with the soon-to-be-available Pentax WG-3 are appropriate with caveats (1) its larger 16MP sensor does not necessarily correlate with better shots; wait for the reviews (2)the WG-3 looks like a toy; I would not bring it to a wedding, etc. (3) the battery life is not as good (4) I see very little information about the new addon lenses.--------UPDATE #1: Lens Adapters + FiltersI have added a rainbowimaging lens adapter with UV protector filter to protect the lens in pocket/etc, and there is no vignetting on the edges of the shot. However, the rainbowimaging adapters have a slightly less secure detent than the OEM products, so I recommend OEM adapters for the lenses.", "Date": "March 9, 2013"}, {"Title": "Noise during recording, not an issue for me", "Author": "Tom", "ReviewID": "R237H90UQ8OON8", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I love this camera.  There is a mechanical humming noise during recording, but this camera was designed with the adventurer in mind.  I purchased the TG-2 instead of the GoPro Hero 3, after much research.I did not buy this camera to record video at a wedding, birthday, holiday, or a picnic.  Although I could, I have other cameras for that.  I strap the TG-2 to my backpack while hiking, mountain biking, rock climbing, and my gear while diving.  The wind noise I record while biking, or the  silence I record while on the peak of a mountain, or the noise underwater, is not important to me, nor is the mechanical noise, the reason why I wanted to record a video is to save the sights and reminisce.  And the video that the TG-2 takes is remarkable under all conditions.  Very high quality considering how rugged it is, and that it can survive the abuse of an adventurer in land and sea.The GPS, manometer, altimeter, barometer, and compass further give the adventurer all the more reason to buy this camera. I'm going to bring this camera on my next flight lesson to compare altimeter accuracy.The pictures are high quality in my opinion. This camera also has aperture priority and a super macro mode, which makes this camera flexible for advanced users.  There is also a high speed setting, that records at 120 or 240 fps with a reduction in video size.  I have some great lighting strike videos, an environment that is not something you would easily be able to pull out most cameras for (in drenching rain or have a high speed video setting).The battery life is also very good, plus is rechargeable via USB.  This means anyone with a portable solar charger can bring this on a long wilderness or backcountry camp/hike and easily save all the memories on a few cheap SD cards... Appalachian Trail anyone?Please understand what you are buying when looking at this camera.  If you want true broadcast quality video and audio with waterproof capabilities, buy a $3,500 camera with a $1000 waterproof enclosure.  That setup may weigh around 5 lbs but you won't have a mechanical hum noise.  If you want high quality pictures, video, and something you can literally throw into your bag and take just about anywhere, the TG2 is perfect.", "Date": "April 11, 2013"}, {"Title": "Telephoto Converter Lens option / miscellaneous", "Author": "M. J. Grace \"Seriousness is not a virtue.\"", "ReviewID": "R3LGXDPX0O8FX8", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "Update: google moron smugmug to get an idea what this camera can and can't do - there is a clicking noise in the videos occasionally and the autofocus struggles in low light but the camera will survive just about anything you can throw at it-----Besides the waterproofing/toughness (I like to kayak) what attracts me to the TG-2 are the fast 2.0 lens speed, the aperture priority mode, the OLED screen, the primarily positive reviews of the TG-1 and most importantly the ability to add the TCON-T01 telephoto converter lens - birds are difficult to photograph with only a 100mm (35mm equivalent) lens so I was eager to see how it all came together.(If you're getting an accessory lens I recommend taking the extra effort to track down Olympus' CLA-T01 adapter instead of buying a third party product as the OEM item includes a lens cover. I have no affiliation with Olympus.)So far the results are exceeding my expectations, particularly the telephoto which allows optical zooming to roughly 170mm (as I understand it the digital zoom gets you around 340mm): even at maximum zoom the image quality to my eyes is good which I presume is largely a function of the fast lens speed. Please see the three customer images I uploaded for examples of what the telephoto lens can do.The camera feels solid in your hands and the buttons seem like they aren't going to wear out anytime soon. I also like the mode dial which allows you to avoid manipulating some menu screens - IMO one of the banes of digital cameras.The  microscopic macro mode gave me new perspective on my right thumbnail which had recently been broken and accordingly trimmed short - see customer image taken with only natural light which reduced depth of field.I tested the video: the microphone recorded clearly the birds chirping nearby and the muted noise from the interstate quite some distance away. Keeping in mind how comparatively quiet it was I could hear the zoom, most noticeably when zooming out and approaching the widest angle position. I reckon if you were recording any kind of noisy environment it would be difficult to hear.I haven't quite bought in to all the gizmos (`magic art filters' etc.) but they're there. The GPS is nifty but I'm concerned it will reduce battery life appreciably although I really don't know how big a deal it is... you can turn it off.It's early on but I think this camera/lens is going to suit my wants very well.", "Date": "February 26, 2013"}, {"Title": "Tough Camera Reboot: Rugged + Great Image Quality! Good all-around performance. Better for photos than video.", "Author": "Terrance S.", "ReviewID": "R323A4MKW4W9RO", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "The Olympus Stylus TG-2 is a waterproof/shockproof action-oriented point-and-shoot camera that packs a ton of features and also manages to take very decent photos. It is an evolutionary improvement over the excellent Olympus Stylus TG-1 which more or less redefined the tough camera genre by combining unsurpassed survivability, long battery life, and good image quality. I used to have a Panasonic Lumix DMC-TS3 and had access to a Fujifilm FinePix XP50, and those cameras were simply outclassed by the TG-1. With the new Stylus TG-2, Olympus is essentially competing against itself.Physically, the TG-2 is very similar to the TG-1: they share the same chassis/battery/accessories but the physical controls have been slightly updated. While it looks like a metal block, the TG-2 is reasonably light and unobtrusive to carry, even in jacket or cargo pockets during all-day excursions. I have big hands, and in my opinion, the overall layout is pretty good. The camera is usable even while wearing thin gloves because the buttons are distinct with good tactile feedback. My only complaint is the placement of the microphone, which is on the top left and prone to getting accidentally covered by stray fingers.The TG-2 carries over the same f/2.0 wide-zoom lens and backside illuminated CMOS sensor but offers many subtle improvements across the board including a deeper underwater rating, 120fps/240fps slow-motion video modes, slightly faster autofocus, aperture priority mode, and somewhat different magic/scene modes. Technical details aside, the TG-2 is a solid take-anywhere photography tool...whether or not you will like it really just boils down to what you expect and what you want to do.As with all other multi-function, jack-of-all-trades devices, the Olympus Stylus TG-2 has a broad range of talents though it makes several compromises along the way. For starters, while the TG-2 is capable of producing fantastic images, this is somewhat with respect to other shockproof/waterproof/crushproof/dustproof/freezeproof cameras. The TG-2's images are well exposed and have great color, but strictly speaking, they are on the soft-side and sometimes exhibit purple fringing and reduced detail. While the TG-2 is easily outperformed by similarly priced traditional cameras, the caveat is that the TG-2 goes where those cameras can't.Another area where the TG-2 makes some compromises is the autofocus system. Compared to the TG-1, the TG-2 feels faster in most scenarios and when it works, it is one of the fastest focusing cameras I've had the pleasuring of using. Unfortunately, this new focusing mechanism is noticeably nosier (it makes rapid ticking noises in operation) and while this isn't an issue for photography, the ticking can be heard in videos shot in quiet environments. Also, for such a fast autofocus, there are some situations where it won't lock on, even if set to single-point focus mode. The alternative is to slowly sweep the entire focal range, and that is what many cameras do, but the TG-2 eschews this.Personally, I am pleased with the Olympus Stylus TG-2 though I believe there is plenty of room for future improvements. Hopefully Olympus can make the autofocus more reliable and add more creative control. I initially bought a tough camera to take pictures in places and situations where I wouldn't dare, and that freedom has grown on me ever since. I also own an Olympus OM-D E-M5 and use it as my \"serious\" camera, and I discovered that unless the situation calls for it (eg. clinical image quality, very low-light situations, specialty work, etc.) I find myself reaching for TG-2 quite often. There's a saying that the best camera in the world is the one that's with you, and with its go-anywhere qualities, long battery life, and good-enough picture quality, chances are that camera is going to be the TG-2.Notes:1) The camera DOES NOT come with a dedicated battery charger. The battery is charged in-camera with one of the waterproof doors open.2) While the TG-2 can be charged using USB, I HIGHLY RECOMMEND using either the stock charger or getting an external battery charger. Quality control for USB chargers is all over the place and all it takes is a bad one to fry your camera!3) This camera is complex enough to warrant a printed manual but Olympus only offers it in electronic format.4) The TG-2 offers Aperture Priority! The lack of manual controls was my biggest gripe with the TG-1 so I'm glad Olympus did something about it, even if is still quite limited. You're only offered 3 choices at any focal length: wide-open, stepped down, and really stepped down. At 25mm, you get your choice of f/2, f/2.8, and f/8. At 100mm, you're at f/4.9, f/6.3, and f/18. While I could see a depth-of-field change between wide-open and stepped down, I couldn't tell the difference between stepped down and stepped down all the way. For example, depth-of-field changes between f/2.0 and f/2.8, but from f/2.8 to f/8 it looks the same despite needing a slower shutter speed to get the correct exposure. Perhaps they're using ND filters to simulate it?5) Microscopic Macro Mode is awesome! (Up to 14x magnification at 1cm)6) The built-in GPS serves primarily to geo-tag photos and is reasonably accurate. It takes a few minutes to lock-on and you won't get information like speed, bearing, etc. The landmark database works internationally! The TG-2 also includes a built-in digital compass and manometer (which is functionally similar to a barometer).7) GPS Log files are recorded in NEMA format. If you press the info button, the camera will jump to the GPS/compass information screen from the off-state. A-GPS is available, though you need to download a tool from Olympus's site and update the camera every couple of weeks.8) Underwater, the camera performs well in automatic mode, though the screen's view angles become quite narrow due to reflections. You pretty much need to be behind the screen while shooting underwater. The waterproof doors on the Olympus are more robust than those on my old DMC-TS3.9) Battery Life is Awesome. You can use it all day and not really worry about the battery dying. If you want to leave the GPS tracking on or have all day/all night excursions, a second battery is still necessary.10) The TG-2's menu is very similar to recent Olympus cameras and it's good because the menus are clear and well organized. My only gripe is the excess visual fluff such as full-color graphics, sliding animations, etc. While these are impressive the first time you see it, they don't really add value and only slow the camera down.11) FLASHLIGHT MODE! From the off-state, press and hold INFO for a few seconds to toggle it on/off.", "Date": "April 2, 2013"}, {"Title": "My favorite new toy", "Author": "New Dad", "ReviewID": "RSSLEGJFF1WY1", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "I bought this camera prior prior to any reviews, but based on the success of the TG-1 and the cool macro feature, I decided to give it a shot.  At $380, this camera is expensive!  Adding in the telephoto lens (TCON-T01) and the required adapter ring, I'm $500 in.  That's the same as a basic DSLR!  Now, I have owned several cameras, including point and shoots, superzooms, waterproof ruggeds, and DSLRs. Of all those, this is now my favorite camera.  Does it take the best pictures and videos?  No, my Canon T2i does.  Does it have the best zoom?  No, my Panasonic ZS3 does.  Is it the most compact rugged camera?  No, my Olympus Stylus S720 SW is.So why is this my new favorite?  It takes very good pictures, there's no shutter lag, it focuses quickly, it has a built in LED light, the flash works amazingling well indoors, it has an attachable telephoto lens, it has reasonable depth of field, it has GPS, it has tons of fun filters, it has an incredible super macro mode, and it's waterproof!  This means I can take this camera on vacation with no worries, or shoot soccer games in the rain and snow.  My daughter can use it without fear of breakage, and its small enough to fit in my pocket.  Yes, my DSLR takes better pictures and video, but I'm not about to take it to Costa Rica and subject it to rain, mud, and potential theft.  And, my DSLR weighs about 3 pounds with the zoom lens.There are some negatives.  In full auto mode, the white balance doesn't always adjust properly indoors, and pictures are a little dark.  So I use program mode and adjust the white balance, exposure compensation, ISO, etc and get great results.  The video is fine visually, but there are some irritating noises (read about this in other reviews).  So what!  I can use this where I can't use my DSLR.  If I'm going to a piano recital or play, I will use my DSLR with an external microphone to capture the best sound.  But if I'm sledding with my daughter, I don't care about a little noise.  Besides, most edited videos (which I tend not to bother with) have music dubbed over the original audio.  Finally, I don't love how the telephoto mounts to the camera.  The mounting ring is made of plastic, and I'm concerned that it will wear out with frequent removal and mounting of the lens.  Time will tell.  One note about the telephoto lens: the camera has to be told that it's got an external lens attached.  To make this quicker, I set up one of the two Custom modes for the telephoto lens.  This allows me to switch back and forth between using the telephoto lens or not, and all I have to do is turn the mode dial a click to switch modes.  Pretty easy, but still a bit of work.I'm rating the camera 4 stars because of the noisy video and inconsistent white balance.  Maybe they will fix these issues with a firmware update, but until then, I will be happily shooting pictures with my favorite new toy.", "Date": "March 20, 2013"}, {"Title": "Like it, would have loved it.", "Author": "Allen", "ReviewID": "R1OB1WZ5BYPYU5", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "Like it... Here are my list of things that would bump it to \"LOVE\".I purchased this camera for a few specific reasons. GPS, f2.0, rough and tumble.First the GPS. You must plug it into your computer to download the current orbital info (every 2 weeks) in order to get any type of a fast lock. This works great, however if you forget, and you're up in the woods, and you want a fast lock for a picture, you're out of luck. Then you're at the mercy of that standard 12.5 minute full GPS signal rotation... I was able to get lock in about 3 to 5 minutes, but it wasn't fast enough for my liking. I'm very used to the GPS in smartphones that cache all that data, and so you get lock in seconds, even in challenging situations.Second the USB cable. It doesn't seem to be any type of cable that I already have several of laying around. It seems to have a standard USB Type A on one end, then some form of a tweaked USB mini-B on the camera side that prevents me from using any one of a dozen cables everyone already owns. This was a big disappointment for me. I use a solar charger on my longer excursions, and have become accustomed to using standardized cables for all my electronics. I now have a cable that I can only use on this camera, that is black, short, and one more thing to lose, and pack with me if I plan on doing an extended trip.Third the start-up time. I haven't used it too much, only on a few hikes in the woods. However I noted that the startup time/function seemed glitchy. At least 3 times when turning on the camera from cold, I would get a screen where I thought I could click a picture, then the screen would go black almost instantly. This threw me off, so I pressed the power again, and then it came up \"normal\". I missed a picture of a small herd of elk in the woods due to this, and so... My nature shots were screwed. I took to hiking with the camera on, just so that I wouldn't miss another shot of 10 elk like that.None of this is a deal breaker for me. I just need to use the camera on a few more hikes, and get to know it better. But I can assure you I'm going to load the GPS data before my trip, and I worry about losing that cable, so I always know where it is.If it was a standard cable, it internally cached orbital data that it learned from the GPS without an external app, and I didn't have a start-up issue a few times. This would be a 5 star camera as far as function. I need to shoot more with it, to evaluate the imaging qualities.", "Date": "June 4, 2013"}, {"Title": "Great for pictures, not for video.", "Author": "Jon M", "ReviewID": "RD4GY46Y81KST", "Overall":

Nice camera, waterproof, etc. A lot of fun. Takes good pictures, nice underwater, has some fun features.For the video though, the camera clicks. If you hold it up to your ear you can audibly hear it. The camera picks it up, so unless you are putting music or something over the video, it is unwatchable. I called Olympus, and there is nothing they can or are willing to do. They were familiar with it, so I'm not the first to call, but nothing they would do.I have uploaded an example of this.So, great camera for pictures, but just not for video.", "Date": "August 29, 2013"}, {"Title": "Great camera unless you take it into the water!", "Author": "Wal92tt", "ReviewID": "R39GAXBUJCZ9ER", "Overall": "1.0", "Content": "We used this camera for 12 days and we we're very satisfied with the quality of the pictures. The Dynamic mode makes great shots! Unfortunately, once we used it in the water, after about 15 minutes in the water, air bubbles came out of the shutter button. The camera was garbage after this. Apparently water had somehow gotten into the camera and it would not work again. Everything was completely sealed which is why this surprised us. The next 2 days were spent trying to dry it out with a hair dryer, charging it and trying to power it on. Both of these attempts only heated up the camera which fogged everything up. The lens is spotted from the inside from all the water now. We were on vacation when this happened and returned it back to Best Buy at day 16. We luckily received store credit since it was 1 day over the return policy. Did we have a lemon? Maybe, but we're not willing to chance it!

Hopefully we'll have more luck with the Pentax.", "Date": "July 31, 2013"}, {"Title": "Great upgrade for active, sport, and underwater photos and video.", "Author": "Henry Wolford", "ReviewID": "R1SYSK4HBAIMB0", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I've owned many Olympus cameras over the years and several of the tough series cameras.  As is the case with all electronics and especially cameras, they have their quirks and limitations.  The first advice I can give is to READ THE OWNER'S MANUAL.For high quality, above water, I stick with the Ultra-Zoom models of Olympus.  They are compact and their big lens provides plenty of light.  The massive zoom range lets me do just about anything I want and I don't have to carry or change out extra lenses.Once you go underwater, or into environments where the camera could get wet, the Tough Series from Olympus does an awesome job.  Just be clear they also have their limits and there are maintenance steps which MUST be followed.  The TG2-IHS is the newest upgrade in the Tough Series and the best so far.  The lens is bigger and faster, allowing for quality photos in a wider range of situations than earlier models.Some of the complaints and low ratings on this page are about video noise and clipping.  This is true with the factory settings and are typical of most compact cameras primarily designed for still shooting.  However, on page 37 of the owner's manual, this is covered by two settings which can be adjusted to reduce wind noise and another which specifically eliminates the \"clipping\" noise.  Once these were set, the audio recorded was just fine.The biggest issue is water protection.  First, realize the standard is \"water resistant\" versus \"waterproof\" and if you want 100% waterproof, nothing beats a specialized underwater housing.  The key to keeping your TG2-IHS dry inside is maintenance of the seals on the doors and following the procedures in the owner's manual.  I will address the Olympus supported techniques and give you a couple which Olympus might not support, but do make a difference.The door seals degrade over time, mostly due to people getting into the door area a hundred times to pull the memory card and run off to print photos, plug the camera into their TV for a quick peak, or do an excessive amount of downloading through the USB.  Limiting the number of times the door is opened and LOCKING the latch, will save a lot on wear.  Olympus also recommends replacing the gasket annually.  Also, if you've been in saltwater, the long rinse/soak in freshwater is necessary to prevent the formation of microscopic salt crystals which wear the gasket and cause leaks.  Do not skip this step.Though Olympus may frown on these ideas, I do a TON of underwater video and photos, so I have learned some tricks which help.  I usually stretch clear plastic wrap over the door areas as an added barrier just before diving.  If I think the seals are a bit weak, a light coating of silicone grease on the seals will add a barrier.  Finally, if you suspect the seal is weak and you still need to shoot, placing some clear plastic wrap under the door before you close it, so the wrap gets between the seal and the door will help.  These are not supported by Olympus but they make a difference.Finally, about the 4X zoom being too limited.  I agree about that to a point.  Above water it is horrible if shooting at a distance, but that is where the Ultra-Zoom excels.  Underwater, long zooms do not work well unless you have tons of light and a huge lens.  For video, 4X is plenty.  Trying to shoot long zoom underwater as video seems like a good idea, however remaining focused on a moving fish is difficult and the resulting background blur as you pan around will make you dizzy.There is a dizzying array of features on this camera and even more options.  Reading the owner's manual and following the instructions will get you the results you desire.  At the same time, placing the camera in Auto or Program will allow the typical \"point and shoot\" user to be happy.  Just don't expect the camera to be in Auto and mind read that you needed to be in Macro or one of the SCN (scene) specialized settings, then blame the camera.", "Date": "June 29, 2013"}, {"Title": "Lots of research yields best result...", "Author": "SiegelPhotography", "ReviewID": "RG1EXS1PBTHHR", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "Love everything about this camera, but the #1 reason is MORE LIGHT.

Fell off on the chair lift, so I am down one. Also bought the extra batteries w/charger kit (a good idea because otherwise you are charging the battery while its in the camera) and the screen preserver in the kit is junk.

However, my wife looked at the pictures and said that it was actually sharper than my Nikon AW100.  For some reason I thought my Nikon was better, but when I opened up dozens of pictures that we took in all types of weather and compared it to this camera, the Nikon had very good colors, but when you zoom in on any of it, there were heavy pixelation.  On this Olympus, I could actually zoom in to my wife's skin and see pores.  She did not find that amusing!As for video, same thing.  The video on this Olympus was ok, but compared to the Nikon, it is definitely sharper than the Nikon.  It seems that the stabilization may not be as good as the Nikon, but I have not used it enough to judge that.The most amazing thing about this camera is the super macro mode.  This is available in photo and in video 1080p mode as well.  I took a picture of a flower at eye level.  Then I switched over to super macro, and even zoomed in to 4x.  I placed the camera literally on the flower (manual say 1 cm!).  I was able to video tape all these insects crawling around inside the flower.  I was shocked!  I took the camera back out, and with the naked eye, could not see anything except a couple of black sand size specks, which I thought was dirt.  NOOOOO, these were the insects that I was videotaping while in macro mode.  Now THAT IS AMAZING!So if you are into macro mode at all, this alone is worth the price of the camera.As to the video noise or zooming noise that are reviewers are saying, I guess I am lucky.  I did not hear anything except for the motor noise that is inherent in any camcorder that I have owned in the past.  AS to zooming noise, yes, I can hear it, but it is the zooming mechanism working.  You are not supposed to be zooming in and out while recording anyway.  Also, what I did was selected microphone on LOW, so may be that's why I don't hear any video noise while recording.UPDATE:  June 25, 2013I have had this a couple months now and took this to Cancun last week.  The pictures and videos are amazing WHEN THE LENS DOES NOT FOG UP.  Comparing this to the Nikon AW100 (which my brother had with him at the same time), this Olympus fogs up significantly more than the Nikon.  I have to aim it at the sun and wait for about 3-4 minutes before the condensation go away.  I wish there was a way to get prevent this because when it works, it is an awesome camera!UPDATE: July 2013One thing I noticed but forgot to mention is that the sound quality is not very good.  Maybe I have a defective unit, but whenever the camera gets wet, the sound just get very muffled until it dries up.  Basically the sound is inaudible like you are covering your ears  or something.", "Date": "March 6, 2013"}, {"Title": "Great Camera", "Author": "Joe Neubauer", "ReviewID": "R6HWVX28T2F0P", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "I've used this camera over the summer, on two trips in the ocean (one beach, one scuba) as well as for several swim team events.  The camera takes great pictures above and below water and has many options for optimizing settings for the specific photographic scene.  It has several underwater modes depending on what you are photographing and there is even some basic capability to set the aperture if you want to get creative.  The camera has a very fast burst mode that allows you to capture fast moving action (make sure you have a high speed SD card).Getting in or out of the water you may need to allow time for the lens to adjust to the temperature change because the lens will fog a little in extremes, but this usually cleared quickly.  You will also need to be aware of water clinging to the outside of the lens if you need to take pictures right after you exit the water.  Shaking the camera usually cleared the lens enough to take photos.I had seen reviews that said the display was hard to see in the bright sunlight; but I did not find this to be a problem, even on very sunny days on the ocean.Under water the camera takes very nice pictures, and captures color very well - examples here [...] flickr. com/photos/jn3/sets/72157635230506370/If you are diving make sure you don't exhale near the camera or it will capture all your bubbles (which you can see in some of the photos)The photos listed below were taken above water, the first one is in ocean using the high speed burst mode (so it has a little more noise)[...] flickr. com/photos/jn3/9528266988/in/set-72157633176317438[...] flickr. com/photos/jn3/9711626499/[...] flickr. com/photos/jn3/9845590966/[...] flickr. com/photos/jn3/9641151192/The camera is a little heavier than other point and shoots, but it also feels a little more more rugged compared to the dive capable cameras I saw on my diving trip.I bought this camera primarily for using in the water and on boy scout excursions where you need something more rugged, but I really like this camera and use it almost as much as my SLR.The only real problem I had with the camera was related to the label on the mode dial.  It came off the first week I was using it in the ocean.  I contacted Olympus and had to send it in to have them replace it (under warranty).  I give Olympus high marks since they not only fixed this but also fixed a scratch on the display.  I was only expecting them to fix the mode dial and wasn't expecting them to do anything with the display since that was my fault and their instructions mention to use caution since the display is not scratch proof.  You can still use the camera without the sticker since the camera will display the mode selection on the display as it changes.", "Date": "October 15, 2013"}, {"Title": "Great Pics In and Out of Water; up to 60'", "Author": "Eddie Chu", "ReviewID": "R429UYEZH8430", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "I bought this at a local store the evening before we left for a scuba holiday after reading various reviews here at Amazon.com and elsewhere.Although an outdoors underwater product, it's a very versatile camera in its own right with a lot more possible adjustments, including limited aperture priority, a rarity for point-and-shoot (P&S;). In addition, there are numerous programs and presets, more than I could have experienced in a week of vacation. As a \"normal\" P&S;, the pictures are great and up to par with the several Canon Elphs that I have owned (and still use) as benchmark.There is a neat panoramic setting that can take up to three overlapping exposures in any one of the four directions. It's not as intuitive as the Sony feature which requires you just pan the camera, but it works well. What I like is it retains high resolution while the Sony panoramic automatically reduces resolution and returns a grainy picture. The Olympus' panoramic remains sharp.Normal flash and natural light pictures all turned out great. I'm not a serious photographer and they look as good as any P&S; pictures that I have taken.I'll focus on the under water performance.There are two underwater settings. One is for around the pool. One is for diving. I can't tell much difference between the two, but I'd say that's a compliment for the preset white balances for these two modes. The idea for presets is to give similar outcomes for different situations, right? So, I use the pool one for snorkeling and the other one for scuba.One caution: If you use the presets, they seem to turn OFF the anti-shake setting. Therefore, the video can come in shaky (as they are taken). If you want to take advantage of the anti-shake setting, set the P mode to underwater and don't bother with the preset, which was what I did and I think the steadier video turned out more enjoyable to watch afterward. However, if you edit your video afterwards, video editing software can steady the video to some extent. The setting may sound confusing as you read this, but it would be clearer if you read this with the camera in you hand.I like the one-touch video button on the back. There is no need to flip any switch between still and video taking. You press the video once to start and again to stop, and you flip between stills and videos without fiddling with anything.When we get to 40' or deeper, the colors are muted and camera does not bring out the brilliant colors of the corals and sea life that my eyes see. I had to use color correction with a photo app on the PC afterwards to add to the contrast. Low light performance is only so-so.Automatic focus underwater works quite well. There were a few blurry shots, especially when in deeper (darker) waters, but overall, most of my shots are well focused. I chased down an eel and a couple of sea turtles and the objects remained nice and sharp--very gratifying.In spite of a few complaints I read about from other reviewers, there was no water leakage problems at all up to 60' (18m). (I went on a few deep dives up to 100'/30m but I didn't want to test my luck and left the camera on the boat). Whenever the camera reaches about 55', a big warning sign comes up on the screen. A couple of times the camera freezes up and would not take pictures. I don't know whether it's a built in preventive feature because of the depth or just a software glitch. I did miss a few nice shots that way.I deduct one point for the short-duration freezes and the so-so low light performance.Overall, I'm happy with the camera and would recommend it to other P&S; photographers who don't want to baby their cameras and want to take it up to 60' under water. Make sure you take the time to learn the features and you will find a right mode or preset for any of your needs. For the price, I think it's just about as much as anyone can expect for a point-and-shoot.", "Date": "July 11, 2013"}, {"Title": "Survived our trip to Costa Rica", "Author": "Scott Dysart", "ReviewID": "R8K4786QJM6FN", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "As advertised-- this camera did everything it was supposed to.

Based on my first impressions of this camera I had mentally started drafting a review based on praising the hardware, but with some criticism of the software and firmware. I even had a great tag line: \"A camera for adventurers who want a few pictures, rather than photographers who want adventures\". That was before the snorkelling trip...For many years now if there's been the prospect of either snorkelling or diving on holiday I've taken a Canon PowerShot S-series or G-series camera with its waterproof housing. I've had at least three generations of that solution, which have been utterly reliable and produced some good results. However they are a bulky solution in these days of reducing baggage allowances, and somewhat slow and clumsy in operation.This year, therefore, I decided to try a different solution, and opted after some deliberation for one of the new \"ultra tough compacts\". While Canon and Panasonic both have a comparable solution, after some deliberation I went for the Olympus TG2, based on a combination of its looks and spec.This is supposedly a very tough piece of kit - waterproof to 15m, drop-proof to 2m, crush-proof to 100kg and with a large operating temperature range. The downside is that this is a market where the competition is intense but based on point for point feature matching, with a focus on improving things like nominal depth protection rather than the photographic features.That meant that even before use in anger there were some compromises: none of the cameras in this class do RAW, even though Canon, for example, support this fully on their smaller high-end compacts like the S95. to make things worse the TG2 also lacks many of the some other fundamental tools to control exposure such as automatic bracketing (despite a very high frame rate which would support it well), or shutter priority.The lack of these features is a complete mystery to me, when these cameras are allegedly designed to be used in conditions where the lighting as well as the environment will be challenging...Early trials did suggested that the camera does have accurate, fast autofocus (which was something I particularly wanted), and makes a decent job of auto exposure in most cases. Picture quality is OK, but the noise levels rise rapidly at ISO 800 and above, the JPEGs have a somewhat \"overprocessed\" look, and there's some noticeable pincushion distortion on underwater shots, even at medium zoom. These are presumably all  the result of the tiny sensor, which is significantly smaller than in compacts like the Canon S95.So, off to Barbados and into the water with the turtles. One immediate observation was that the display is very difficult to use at snorkelling depths (where there may be quite a lot of ambient light from above/behind you), and the tiny font becomes illegible for a user like me with ageing eyes. A \"high contrast\" option on the display, and a large-font \"quick menu\" option (like on all my Canon and Panasonic cameras) would be useful.However, a few minutes into the snorkelling session I noticed a much more serious problem: the camera kept on switching itself off, and the battery level was dropping almost as I watched. I managed to snatch a couple of shots, but the camera was really misbehaving, and I had to give up.Back on the boat the problem was immediately apparent - the camera had sprung a leak presumably through the cover for the USB port, as that had evidence of water inside it. However, instead of being limited just to the port section, the water had spread rapidly through the camera with the result that the lens was misting up and the electrical problems were getting rapidly worse. Although I tried drying the camera out and recharging it, it's now completely dead. Fortunately I had invested in a waterproof SD card, so I managed to rescue a few decent shots, but otherwise it's a write-off.This is an extremely poor design. As you have to charge the battery in camera (using the proprietary USB cable - another peeve), there's no option of just sealing the camera for a complete trip. You would also think that the camera would have some measure of \"double sealing\" so that in the event of a leak into the port or battery/card openings the water wouldn't permeate quickly into the rest of the electronics, but this is clearly not the case.This camera is completely inadequate for its intended use. Fortunately my suppliers (the excellent Wex Photographic) have promised me a full refund.

Now that I'm back & thoroughly tested its daily use for a week, I can say that is is an awesome camera!  We went snorkeling along the coral reefs, sailing, ocean swimming...., and this camera took some beautiful & clear pictures underwater, over water, and on land. The pictures are not perfect like it would be with my DSLR, but pretty close!  I can't say if the waterproof rugged features will still be perfect after a year or more, but after 7 days of daily water submersion for hours each day, it works like new (I followed the directions to soak in over 10 mins. of tap water after each day & let air dry).I even tried videotaping during snorkeling & sailing, and the videos were beautiful.  Of course, this is not a professional camera used by documentaries, so if you are diving deep where there is little light, the images will be dark.  But in decent light, the underwater images are beautiful.  I do agree with some reviews that say you can hear the camera focusing mechanism when you videotape a quiet scene; so I just turned off the microphone during my snorkeling videotaping & the video is sound-free & ready for you to add your own music. This camera is not meant for recording classical symphony music, so it's not fair to compare the audio to a dedicated camcorder.One negative aspect is that the zoom can't zoom very much--just 4X; there is an additional attachable lens that you can buy that allows more zoom, but this cost more money.  This was sometimes limiting, but overall not significant for me.On the plus side, the special preset functions work well to give you the best picture without too much adjustments.  The Macro function is better than my DSLR because you can get within 1 cm of the object.Anyways, if you are looking for a waterproof & rugged camera that captures fun water activities and sceneries, then you will like this camera.

The results of my research were essentially a dead heat between this model and the Lumix TF-5. I bought the Lumix. Because of its remarkably poor image quality, especially in low light, the Lumix was returned within a week and I bought the TG-2.This is an outstanding camera -- for what it is.  And what is seems to be something that many reviewers don't understand.These cameras are essentially ruggedized point-and-shoots. Comparing their image quality to what you get from a full-frame DSLR or a crop-factor DSLR or even a \"bridge camera\"  is ridiculous. For what it is, this camera's IQ is excellent. And the macro mode is superlative.These cameras are not high-end camcorders. Nor is their video as good as what you'll get from a crop-factor DSLR. For what it is, this camera's video output is excellent.I'd like to address two of the more common criticisms of this model in more detail:(1) Poor audio. My model does not produce the constant noise that some users report. But it does pick up  handling noise and lens motor noise. (A tip: If you are constantly zooming in and out, your video is going to look amateurish in the extreme. If you want to get closer to something, use your feet.) Anyone who expects great -- or even good -- audio from a ruggedized point-and-shoot is living in a fool's paradise. It ain't gonna happen.If ambient sound is important, you need to record it on an external device, something like a Zoom H4N Handy Portable Digital Recorder, just like you would if you were shooting video on a DSLR costing a few thousand dollars. When I need ambient sound, I mount the camera and the Zoom on an old, lightweight flash bracket. Works like a charm, and using the flash bracket helps to stabilize the camera.(2) The Olympus CLA-T01 Conversion Lens Adapter for Olympus TG-1 & TG-2 (Red) attaches loosely and falls off easily. I hate to be the bearer of some pretty obvious news, but you're not putting it on correctly. Align the white dots on the camera and the ring. Twist the ring clockwise very firmly until the dot on the ring clicks solidly into place at 9 o'clock. It will not fall off; in fact, significant torque will be required to remove it.If you need a ruggedized camera, I highly recommend the TG-2.", "Date": "February 6, 2014"}, {"Title": "Bigger camera than expected", "Author": "A.

The GPS feature will be super handy for our long hiking vacation coming up soon. The LCD screen is easy to see. It is nice to have a camera that can withstand the variable weather conditions our vacation invariably include.Cons: Olympus-give us a darn lens cap!

My initial impressions were; The camera appears very well built, the image quality is great, pictures in the pool turned out clear and bright, low light shots were good quality, and the color was accurate.The microscope macro is amazing and can pick up amazing detail. I have never seen anything like this in a snapshot camera.  I was able to zoom into a printed letter and see the individual dots that formed the type.The bad is, the panorama setting uses a three-photo stitch (rather than a scrolling picture) and the photo has a lot of ghosting where the pictures come together.  I tried the panorama mode with both short & long distances and found the problem was the same.  Additionally, the lens design does not take great portraits and will not blur out the background without purchasing the telephoto adapter.The TG-2 is packed with features and has a ton of available accessories, which I probably will not purchase or use but it is nice to have the option.  If the camera had WiFi and used a different type of panorama mode I would be 100% sold on it.  Unfortunately, the panorama mode is something I use a lot and I am not satisfied with the feature.  If you don't use panorama or WiFi, the camera is an excellent option.I purchased a Panasonic TS5 for comparison and will return the lesser of the two cameras.*UPDATE*I compared this camera to the Panasonic TS5.  Though the TS5 had a few more features I wanted, I found the picture quality was not as good.  The TS5 takes a nice bright picture but at the expense of picture detail.  Most of the pictures have an overexposed appearance which washes out the fine detail.  Additionally, the Panasonic did not feel good in the hand and I found my finger consistently coveted the flash.I took the Olympus with me this weekend through the Tough Mudder run in Tahoe and it worked very well! I fell on it, rolled through the mud with it, swam with it, it still took great pictures and video but did suffer a couple of scratches on the finish.

Instead, the camera often tries to compromise by altering other internal exposure settings.  Other times the flash goes off and takes a decent picture.  I cannot figure out why.  However, the darker the room, the worse the camera functions, and in serious darkness, the flash never goes off.  It also has great difficulty in focusing in darkened environments, although a user may set the camera for a momentary \"flashlight\" effect for the focuser to use in setting the focus.  My Sony DSC WX150 does a much better job in this environment for approximately half the price--when it's dark (including completely dark), the camera focuses and ignites the flash--a pretty picture is always the result.However, I did not buy the TG-2 for low-light, indoor work.  Although the camera is new and I have not really put it to the test, I plan to use the device in the Grand Canyon.  I expect that it will do just fine in that environment.  I was interested in a durable, waterproof, simple-to-use camera under those conditions.  We'll see how it does there and I'll report back.But I still have to say that the camera was relatively expensive and one would not expect to have to compromise.  When I take this camera along, I would have expected it to work without having to worry about it being so touchy about the light levels in its operating environment.  That's why even if the camera does well in outdoor environments, I'll re-confirm my rating, but I'll never raise it.  If it does poorly, I'll lower the rating further.This is an August 14, 2013 extension of my earlier review:As mentioned elsewhere in the comments, the flash performed much better by slightly zooming in (to 1.1X).  However, the problem did not disappear altogether.  I appreciate everyone's suggestions about this issue.As promised, I have returned from my trip to the Grand Canyon to report on the camera's performance there.  It worked well, but low lighting never came into play as I took all shots during the daytime.  The camera was reliable and focused rapidly, including shots of a fossil from a distance of about four inches.  The camera was exposed to some water, but never completely immersed, so I cannot adequately rate the waterproof claims.  I also took along the fish-eye lens, and it was useful in a place like the Grand Canyon.  However, like any fish-eye, you need to compose your picture carefully to avoid major linear distortions in the images.The video is OK, but the \"Steady-Cam\" feature is not as good as my Sony DSC WX-150.  Other TG-2 users have reported \"camera noises\" during recording, but I did not encounter them.  I did not use video very much and it was not really a major part of the images I took.Battery life for me was excellent.  I was worried that down in the canyon without electricity, I would exhaust the batteries.  I took only 158 pictures and no flash was involved, but I didn't make much of a dent in the first battery (I brought along five!).  YMMV.Bottom line--I like the camera, it's ruggedness, and the photos it takes.  It will be my \"go-to\" system for vacations just because of its overall durability and waterproof capabilities, as well as the available accessories, all in a relatively compact package.  I plan to complete my outfit with the telephoto lens which approximately doubles the zoom, and possibly the waterproof casing (but it costs almost as much as the camera itself).", "Date": "June 28, 2013"}, {"Title": "A Good Camera That Could Have Been Great", "Author": "J.

The camera focused quickly in most situations, took great, vivid shots and was all around a joy to use.  Colors were a little warmer in the photos than real life, but not terribly so.  Underwater pictures were clear and bright, with decent depth.  The \"Auto\" setting worked well for most pictures, providing well focused, properly lighted images.  There are a bunch of other preconfigured settings, night time, underwater, super macro (which was also amazing for flowers and insects), and others for pretty much anything you can think of.  Additionally, the panoramic setting is amazing!  It uses the built in gps to detect how far you've turned the camera, and any change of orientation, and automatically snaps the picture when the camera is turned at the right angle.  It guides you to the right position on screen.  The camera then combines the images together automatically, allowing you to see what it looks like.  It takes some time, to put them togather, but this is the best way to take panoramics I've seen.A couple other notes, it requires the olympus proprietary usb connector, which is a pain, but not the worst.  It's not the most beautiful camera, but looks a lot better than other tought cameras.  We only tested the waterproof to about 10 feet, so I can't judge further, but it was salt water, and there were no problems.At the end of the day, if you're looking for a rugged camera that takes great pictures you'll want to show off, this is the one to go with.  The photo's aren't SLR quality, but they are great quality.  You don't have to worry about breaking the camera, and it wont weigh you down.

The appropriate charger in this case is the $50 Olympus UC-90 USB Battery Charger, which is a USB connection to the battery - you still need the AC/USB device.  Too many parts to carry around and lose!Second, the strap is a flat strap with a wrist loop, but no way to cinch it down tight around your wrist.  This strap is rather useless in water sports or any activity where you don't want the camera to go flying off your wrist.

The TG-2 suffers in comparison to the SW1030 for my needs.  The new strap is difficult to manipulate compared to the old strap.  The focusing mechanism is slower on the TG-2.  The zoom buttons are smaller on the TG-2 and are difficult to operate compared to the old SW1030, plus, when you get the zoom's attention it is slow to react, then overreacts by zooming to quickly in either direction.  The TG-2 has two different colored lens bezels supplied with it.  It appears purely for aesthetics.  The plastic bezels click on and off.  The problem is that they unclick off too easily.

If you are researching P&S; cameras and just want a bit of extra durability, you will probably be unhappy with this camera given what it costs.

If you can use the \"tough\" features this is a solid choice for a camera that is durable and useful under normal conditions as well.ProsAlmost instant onVery fast first shotGreat battery life with USB rechargeDouble locked access doorsEasy to keep clean.  A quick rinse or wipe and it looks new.Screen at first seems mediocre, but stays very clean and smudge + glare free.  Easy to see in bright light too.Feels solid and well made, nice strap setup.  Add a carabiner and you can toss it in your pocket and clip it to a belt loop and go anywhere.Video - It's been a problem for some, but I took a video while on a roller coaster and although I wasn't zooming (I could barely film and hang on) there was very little wind noise and voices were crystal clear.  Focus was excellent.  One of the best videos I've seen from this type of camera.ConsA bit bulky if you are used to small cameras.  Underwater or with gloves on this would not be a con.Follow-up shots are not bad but a bit slower than cameras in this price class (using class 10 cards).Even with the 2.0 lens I found low light shots in auto modes a little disappointing.  Like many P&S;'s it seems easily confused as to lighting indoors and some pictures have that high iso noise effect.  Tough to dial it out even when switching to manual settings.  I think there may be a learning curve with it however.  The number of scenes and modes is overkill but there are some specialty ones that do work.  The night lighting mode took great pictures of the electrical parade at Disney.  Even though I have DSLR's I expect P&S;'s to do a good job even on the auto or scene settings.Price.  Overall image quality in normal outdoor lighting situations is good, but not remarkable.  Comparable to some of the better cameras in the $175-$225 range not $350-$400.Overall this is a solid camera. I've taken it to the beach, in the pool, to the frozen north and to Disney.  I have not taken it down 50' or dropped it or stepped on it.  Assuming it is \"tough\" as advertised,  I think I will enjoy this as a addition camera to take when conditions merit.  Again, I think if you were looking for one camera only, and your need for tough conditions is a nice to have versus any specific need, I'd look elsewhere.  You can almost buy a spare at this price.

He told me that Olympus compacts cameras always have issues. So i completely ignored him and bought it anyway.

So here it goes!!!I've only had it 4 days because the first one out of the box on Christmas day was defective. We discussed getting a different model, but this one has so many good reviews (on many different outlets) we decided to try again, I'm so glad we did! I'm not going to go into the toughness or compact features, they have been talked about at great length in other reviews.First, if you have owned an Olympus digital before, you know how complicated the menu options can be. We had a 3030zoom for about 16 years and it finally died, it took AMAZING pictures even at only 3.3 megapixals because of the lens quality, but the menu options were almost impossible to figure out. We knew  the quality of pictures was probably a no brainer with the TG-2, again, because of Olympus lens quality and I was willing to take on the menu again.To my surprise the menu, though still pretty involved, has a VERY cool feature!! It has a cheater window at the bottom of each option to tell you EXACTLY what that feature does. (you can turn that off if you want, but who would want to? :-})  With the 3030 I always had to refer back to the owners manual which was also daunting. But with the TG-2 I only have to look at the manual occasionally because of the newness yet. So if you are worried about the reputation Olympus has with the menus fear not, they have listened to the consumer about this one!Another really cool feature is that you can make \"folders\" for grouping pictures which is very cool if you are going to be on trips at various locations, you won't have to try and organize once you download to the computer, a lot of the work will already be done for you.The pictures I have taken so far are AMAZINGLY clear and detailed (even in some not so good lighting) and the colors just pop! It has even out done my Cannon EOS Rebel at only 2 more megapixels. I love all of the special effects features, I'm having a lot of fun playing around with them. (it's in the \"magic\" menu) I also took a video of my cats playing, very clear and defined. I like that you can just hit the red button to start recording, no more switching modes to do so.The one and only drawback I have found is that if you zoom during video recording you can hear the motor very clearly in the video itself. So make sure you are zoomed in and out before you start recording. Or a person could possibly cover it with music?

I am well aware of the advances and choice of premium cameras for professional underwater and above water cameras from the likes of professionals like Cathy Church.  And the need for great lighting.  Checking and greasing o rings each dive.  Patience.  Water clarity.  Being very still.  And I am certain that those wanting the most supreme camera on the market will step things up a level...  But for those that just want a really great camera for snorkeling or SCUBA to 50' without a housing or several hundred with a housing, this camera is excellent.  I like it on the underwater mount with a very bright light.  And with a filter as everyone knows the further you go down... The less light and color will show up and particularily red disappears the fastest.  To have better photos adequate lighting and filter for red is imperative.  Else, just take photos in 10-15 ft.  If you want great photos.  This camera takes great photos under and above water just as it is.  But more professional photos with lighting and filter.  Video above water and sound quality is very good.  As is video below water, but sounds there should be dubbed over with music.

On my 2nd trip, after using it underwater for just 1 day, the camera went crazy. It still turns on, it occasionally even takes photos. But none of the menus or zoom work.

I bought it after my Panasonic DMC-ZS3 died from some water splashes from the Flow Rider on a cruise ship. I decided to go with the TG-2 because of the durability, F2.0 lens, and advertised great picture quality. Here's what I've found:(1) A lot of photos lack sharpness - almost like the auto-focus isn't really locking on the subject. I've also tried spot focus and metering without any great improvement. (2) The camera performs poorly with a backlit subject.  I think its because Olympus relies too much on the F2.0 lens in its automatic settings. That's to say, it selects an open lens (close to F2.0) but in iAUTO mode, the flash hardly ever fires, even in low light. This is especially noticeable with back lighting (why doesn't the flash fire???). I have also tried manual settings in P mode - with forced flash and manual back lighted compensation - but, I usually get an almost properly exposed subject with a really washed-out background. On other cameras, I've been able to find settings that pretty consistently work with back light. (3) Overall picture quality out doors in sun is good to very good. However, If your taking a photo of a person with their face as the subject, their face still lacks sharp focus.Bottom Line: So, I would still buy the TG-2, however, with reservations. I would buy it again because I don't want to be on a trip and have my camera konk-out because of a small water splash - like my Panasonic did. But, don't expect the excellent overall results that you would get from a high end non-tough point shoot.My biggest question is - Why doesn't Olympus allow the flash to fire in iAUTO (or more correctly, it ALMOST never flashes in that mode - and rather opens the lens toward F2.0 giving poor depth of field and less than optimum lighting compensation.", "Date": "June 30, 2013"}, {"Title": "Camera met all expectations", "Author": "Zachery McCarty", "ReviewID": "RQ8MWVTLQ2FV4", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "I bought this camera for a snorkeling and diving vacation and it worked perfectly.

It is a little heavy and bulky, but for what I bought it for, it's perfect.  I still use a DSLR as my main travel camera, and I'm sure there are much better point and shoot cameras that would get better picture quality and are lighter and smaller than the TG-2, but if you are looking for a rugged point and shoot with good underwater capability I would highly recommend this.

I have wanted a waterproof camera for years, and so I decided to start reading reviews online...  Many of them pointed to the Tough TG-2 as a 'best-in-class' point and shoot.  I have never liked Olympus' products, so I was a bit leery, but after such across-the-board high marks, I decided to give it a shot.Upon my first time out with the camera, I immediately noticed a couple issues - the first was ergonomic, the other was image quality.Ergonomics - command dial very stiff to turn, especially with wet hands.  The arrow pad is located too close to the command dial and ends up requiring you to almost click with your fingernail instead of fingertip to make selections...  Just kind of put me off.The #1 reason to avoid this camera is POOR IMAGE QUALITY.  With technology being what it is today, you should NOT look at a full sized image, shot at the lowest ISO (100) and see pixelation.  These files are super pixel-y, even at ISO100.  Now granted, I am used to using very nice cameras, but nevertheless, IF YOU CARE ABOUT IMAGE QUALITY and printing, avoid this camera. Trust me.If all you want to do are post snapshots to Facebook, etc, I'm sure this will do the trick, but if you love photography and good images, find another model.Lastly, I had it yesterday in the ocean, third time I have used it.  I started getting fogging inside with everything sealed up properly...  Didn't notice till after I had made many blurry, out-of-focus pictures.  Really disappointed.

Contrast this with the manipulations I need to do with my DSLR and this handy little camera has become my go-to device when not looking to shoot portraits or sports, fast action images.  The one caveat I have - although I've dropped the camera a few times, and the fisheye lens I bought separately (which I love!), I've not been brave enough to take it underwater.I've also bought the telephoto lens, which seems to need to be fully extended to work properly.  One interesting combination I found that works is that I can attach the fisheye lens to the end of the telephoto lens and get some very funky images, though not particularly clear.Let me say this about the \"Magic\" mode on the camera - it's fantastic!  Try and you'll love it.  It allows you to do soft focus, richer hues, mirroring, mosaic and what looks close to HDR.  If you visit my Flickr page - [...] - you'll see some examples of the flexibility of imagery you get with this setting.There's also the SCENE mode, which allows you to adjust between even more optional settings - indoor, landscape, sport, selfie, snow, underwater, panorama, HDR, night, documents, etc.  I've tried the HDR setting and frankly prefer the output using the Magic mode's 11th setting, mentioned above.A drawback regarding the video function - although I find that the video is clear and the audio levels are acceptable, on my Dell PC I find that I cannot replay the videos using Windows Media Player.  There are probably other player software that will work, but this is puzzling that WMP won't play the videos.  Don't know if you'll encounter that problem working on an Apple platform.All in all, though, I think you'll find this camera is as tough as advertised, and provides far more capabilities than realized.", "Date": "May 3, 2014"}, {"Title": "Nice camera until you get it wet", "Author": "Van", "ReviewID": "RFW51VTZTXIA4", "Overall": "3.0", "Content": "I bought this camera for a trip to the Virgin Islands.

Fast lens, good picture quality and comparable or better specs then the rest.  I've only had the camera for a few days but from the test shots I've taken, the pictures are pretty good, and the camera is easy to use.  The pictures aren't as sharp and clear as the ones I get from my DSLR and best lens, but I didn't expect them to be.  They are as good or better than my other point and shoot cameras of a similar price point though.  What I do find troubling, and why I've only given a three star rating is Olympus's quality control.  My first copy of this camera was virtually dead on arrival.  It took two pictures and then died.  The camera would only turn on and off and give me the info screen, but nothing more.  Back to Amazon it went, and Amazon promptly sent me another camera without issue.Camera number 2 arrived, and this time the camera worked.  I went through the setup, numerous on and off cycles, test shots and video clips, and the camera works perfectly.  However, when I opened the CD that came with the camera that contains the camera manual, editing software, and registration info on it, there is a huge crack in the CD that makes it completely unusable. Not catastrophic, but frustrating.  Fortunately all of the software can be obtained from the Olympus web site, but this is completely unacceptable quality control for just about any product, and especially for one that costs as much as these cameras do.  To receive two different copies of the same product and for each one to have a defect in it, will definitely make me think more than twice about buying any other Olympus product.", "Date": "March 17, 2014"}, {"Title": "Great camera for on/in/near water use", "Author": "Bill Gehring", "ReviewID": "RDALOM6L4W4AG", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I wanted a camera to take snorkeling and kayaking on a recent trip to the Galapagos Islands; this camera filled the bill.

My refurb only came with a red one.I wanted a rugged camera to take pictures during a Tough Mudder.  I carried the camera around my neck using a metal lanyard.  It survived all the various mud and water obstacles, including the Artic Enema.  The only obstacle I did not carry this camera on was the Plank.  This camera was submerged under water and dragged through mud.  It survived all of this without a scratch.  I was very happy about the ruggedness of this camera.The camera is a little heavy-- no surprise. Since I was going to be occupied with running and dealing with all the obstacles, I had the camera set to auto and hoped the camera would choose the correcting settings when I had the opportunity to take a picture.  Unfortunately, I was expecting too much.  Some of the pictures had blown highlights or were too dark.  What bothered me the most was that the LCD was pretty much useless in the sunlight.  I found myself just pointing the camera at my friends and hope I would get them in the frame.I admit that a few of the bad pictures were due to the operator, or water/mud on the lens.  However, this is not a cheap camera.  I expected better when the lens was clean and I was able to properly frame a shot.Despite these draw backs, I like this camera.  It is very rugged, and I do realize it is a point and shoot camera.

Among other things, it has a super macro mode with which you can capture things really close.  I like almost everything about this camera so far.  I tested it underwater and it has worked great so far.  Regarding picture quality and other aspects of it, it is great, including video.  At first I didn't hear any noise at all in the video as described by other customers.  After some time I did started to hear the annoying noise.  You can mitigate it a little by lowering the microphone volume.  I also noted that the microphones are located on the top left corner of the camera which is where someone usually puts the fingers when holding the camera.  You need to be careful not to block the microphone when holding the camera.  Some things I don't like about the camera are the following: No lens protection!  This is suppossed to be a tough camera but I am really worried that the lens will get scratched or damaged in some way if hit by something.  If this happens then the camera is useless for me, no matter how tough it is.  I mean, it would have been great if it had some kind of lens protection, at least when turned off.  So I don't feel very confident about this camera being so tough because of this, same with the LCD, although it says the LCD is scratch resistant. Also I consider the camera is a little heavy for its size, and bigger than what I expected, but it is not too big either.  It has a special USB connector for the camera, so you cannot use other cable.  The video noise is a negative also.  The price seemed a little high to me, but I guess it is a high quality camera.

He was booked to do a shark dive and I wanted someone to be able to take pics underwater. I own a Canon DSLR so appreciated that a small point and shoot was  not going to produce the type of image I am used to. When I first saw one of the pics taken while he was out on a fishing boat I said to my son \" I really hope that picture was taken with the new camera as the colour capture is amazing.\" It was and so therefore I was very happy. The one single feature that caused me to buy this camera was the high aperture setting ( for me to get a DSLR lens with a setting like this I would have to spend close to $1000) and the Aperture priority mode. I have some great shots of hubby with the sharks as well as a some great low light pics. Some of the reviews have been really harsh but I think people need to understand this is a small, point and shoot camera not a DSLR. It is packed with features and without reading the manual I was able to work out how to use it. Hubby did not have any problems with it not being watertight and it is now back home with me as dry as they day it was delivered. I ordered it from Amazon and had it delivered to an address in the US when it was on sale. It was around $200 cheaper than I would have been able to get it in Australia if I had been able to find a site or store which sold it! So overall I am very happy. If people are having problems with the quality of their images it may have more to do with the settings than with the camera. Do some reading and find out how to take great shots!

Let me begin by saying that I'm not a professional photographer, but an enthusiast. I have many cameras that were purchased here on Amazon over the last couple of years. (Nikon D5100 and several lenses; Canon G12; Lumix LX-7; Olympus Tough TG-2. These cameras were purchased after many diligent hours of research based on reviews and comparisons found on the internet, as well as the few times I could actually see and feel the cameras in brick and mortor stores around Baltimore, Washington DC and Annapolis.  ... let me say from the start and say that the TG-2 is a great little camera, and thus far, I have only used it for 2 days in my local pool. I have made several videos and took about 25 snaps. The camera has proved itself so far, though I have reservations about the video portions of the camera that were wavy and had some issues on playback on the camera and on my laptop. I will update this review in the next few months.  My main decision for choosing this camera over the competition was the many years Olympus has in making it's waterproof/ weather-resistant cameras and the various first-person reviews I had read. Granted, it's not as guaranteed waterproof as my deep-diving or snorkeling camera combination, (Canon Elph 310HS $200 / Ikelite 6243.31 Underwater Camera Housing $250) but for a small camera with decent features it will serve me well.  Feel free to send me your questions through Amazon.  ** UPDATE - Sept 2nd 2013 **  ..this has proved to be an excellent little camera in and out of bad weather. I have used it primarily at the pool this summer taking some excellent shots of my grand daughter and her friends. For land use the camera takes excellent snaps and is now my carry-everywhere camera. If you are inventative enough and like to play as I do you will enjoy the ART scenes portion, that take some very different snaps.  ... and just to make sure I could keep the lens from getting scratched I recently purchased the Rainbowimaging 40.5mm Conversion Lens Adapter, a Fotodiox 40.5mm Snap-on Lens Cap and the Vivitar Series 3-Piece Multi-Coated HD Pro Filter Set. (this set has a UV filter, a CPL circular polarizing filter and a ND 8 neutral density filter.  Total cost was about $27.00. This set-up now gives me the security of keeping the UV filter on the camera when I'm not shooting underwater and then I can add the CPL or the ND8 on front of the UV filter when shooting pictures at the beach. (Just remember to remove all of the filters before shooting underwater, as I don't think they are water-sealed and water may enter the threaded area and get trapped between them and the camera lens.)  ..so far the only issue I have had with the TG-2 is the lens adapter cover rings that are suppilied with the camera. They do come off very easily. Many people have mentioned losing them on shootings. (I had one come off the camera myself oneday. Now Olympus gives you a black and a red as spares, so keep an eye out when using them on this camera, as they are not on very tight.

Like many have  talked about and even demonstrated, it is annoying and very prominent.  That being said... I really like this camera. I can not say enough about how tough it is and how tough it FEELS. And to bring it underwater, how it feels matters. It is about confidence to use the camera for what it is meant for. The pictures are sharp and crisp. I LOVE the macro mode. I have been playing with that more than any other function. It is pretty sick! Just make sure you turn the LED on when using it. I haven't found a way to keep the light on though. Every time you switch out of macro and go back, you have to turn the LED back on. I wish it was pre-set. Maybe there is a way, but I haven't found it. But no big deal, it takes half a second to turn on. The preset modes(if you get too lazy to put in A-mode or don't know how) are pretty good. Most of them do what are meant for and take good shots for being a pre-set.The only issue I had(this is my experience) with my purchase,  I had to send my first camera back. I am PRIME, and the new one came in two days at no cost, but it was still a tiny snag. I was taking a few pictures and I noticed a spot in the photos. I am familiar with what it was, sensor dust.

I've read plenty of reviews and I'm reasonably happy with most of what I've read about the camera.But anyone doing any research into this camera will come across reviews where people report on some unwelcome noise in video recordings.  If you look on YouTube you should be able to find a few videos taken by the TG-1 that demonstrate the problem.  I haven't found any TG-2 videos that try to reproduce the problem, and reviews that mention the subject seem to indicate that the problem is subdued or non-existent in the TG-2.  Having a relatively short return window I did some quick tests.So was there any noise in my TG-2 videos?  Short answer is yes, there is.  But in my opinion it's not that bad, and probably not anything that will make me return the camera.  There are two types of noise I encounteredZooming - When the camera zooms you can hear the noise of the servo motor.  It's not all that loud, but certainly noticeable.  This may be a side-effect of folded optics in a tough waterproof case as opposed to the extending lens assembly of more conventional point and shoot cameras.  To be honest, what I find worse than the zooming noise is the zooming speed.  It's certainly a tad on the slow side, and I'd like it if the autofocus was a little zippier - it takes a moment or two for the camera to refocus after zooming while doing video recording.Autofocus - In some of the TG-1 video samples I found there was a jackhammer like ticking that could be heard as the autofocus tried to zero in.  In my test videos I was able to reproduce this sound in my TG-2, but honestly it wasn't bad - better than what I had found in TG-1 videos.  It was more noticeable when I was recording in a quiet room, but out in the open with cars and people doing their thing, it didn't seem all that bad.The only other negative point of this camera - it charges and transfers images using a proprietary USB cable.  But I ordered an external charger with two spare batteries to help with that, and the camera supports EyeFi memory cards so if I get one of those later, I should have almost no need for the cable.Those are the only negative points of the camera I could come up with, and in my opinion they are outweighed by the positives - fast lens, aperture priority, high speed video recording, lots of fun effects modes, good image quality for a tough camera - both stills and video.  But then still shots are more important to me than video - if video recording is important to you then maybe the noise thing may be more of a purchase factor.  But in my case it looks like I'll be keeping this camera.", "Date": "April 28, 2013"}, {"Title": "Love this camera!", "Author": "Sean Adams", "ReviewID": "R2JLLSR54DCEH3", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "This camera is awesome.

One, it is a weatherproof and shockproof camera (which does come with limitations I have discovered).  I enjoy hiking and backpacking and wanted a camera that could withstand rain, snow, sand, cold temperatures, and everything else imaginable. This camera puts me at ease...I can throw it in my pocket/pack or hang it around my neck on a lanyard and not worry about it getting scratched up.  It has a sturdy feel to it, which I prefer. It takes wonderful photos of landscapes (the panorama feature is a huge bonus).Number two, the macro abilities are amazing on this camera.  It can get up to 1cm away from an object and take a very detailed shot.  I take photos of plants and flowers, so this is the best feature that it offers to me.  The quality really is sharp and vibrant, but natural.I bought this camera on Amazon because I was given an Amazon gift card.  This is my first experience with Amazon and they have been outstanding.  I dropped the camera (from my hand at a height of 4 feet off the ground) on a greenhouse floor the other day, and, to my surprise, the corner of the camera cracked.  This seems to be a design flaw since the aluminum casing covers only the front and back of the camera.  The corners appear to be made of plastic (and the chance that the camera will fall on these corners seems very high).  The aluminum is very shiny (in the red color at least); at first this troubled me, since it looked very scratch-able...but the aluminum part of the camera does seem quite durable.  Despite the shockproof limitations, I really do love this camera.  I don't intend to use it for underwater purposes, but it serves my needs for a rain and snowproof camera very well.", "Date": "October 20, 2013"}, {"Title": "DO NOT buy from Electronics Basket...ripoff company!", "Author": "A.

I have not tried it under water but feel certain it would do well. Everything else about it is very good. You will read about some background noise when shooting videos and it is caused by using the zoom feature on the camera as the very sensitive microphone picks up the noise when zooming in and out. I don't shoot many videos, but to help that problem I either avoid zooming in when shooting a video and you can also just walk closer to the subject instead of zooming in. It's not a big deal to me, even with the background noise. Again I am pleased that Olympus switched to the SD card instead of the XD cards they used in years past. Two reasons, the SD card is available almost anywhere at a reasonable price, and the next reason is, I use a lot of Trail Cameras and they all use SD cards. You can just pop the SD card from your trail camera into the Olympus camera and view your trail camera photos right there in the field. Very handy feature. The on/off button on this camera is bigger and much easier to turn on and off than some of the older models were. Another feature I like on this camera is that I shoot a lot of self timer photos in my hunting ventures. Once you set this camera on self timer, it stays on self timer till you turn that feature off or turn the camera off. Some of the older Olympus cameras you had to turn the self timer on for each shot you took. That was pretty cumbersome and not so handy. My major use of this camera is for taking photos and this camera takes great sharp clear photos. It is a simple no brainer operating camera. If you are a little bit technology challenged you will find this camera easy to operate. I had trouble showing my videos at first and called the Olympus support group and they were very helpful. I had not downloaded the Olympus set up software on my computer. After I did that everything went smooth. You have to watch your videos on the Olympus software on your computer. The software disc comes free with the camera and the operating manual is on that disc also. You also have to have Quick Time on your computer to use the software and that is available as a free download on line.

Never really dropped far, never in cold weather, and survived multiple snorkling trips before succombing to a dive trip off of Catalina island.

Very impressive.I just got back from a weeklong trip to Kaua'i, where we went snorkeling several times, and this camera produced perfect photos underwater. Remember to set your White Balance to \"underwater\" and this thing just works flawlessly. Set it to Aperture priority, set it to \"action\" focusing mode, put in a big memory card, and snapsnapsnapsnap and then cull the blurred photos later. The battery lasts plenty long for an afternoon of snorkeling with tons of exposures, with the LCD screen on the whole time. Other reviewers have said how their cameras failed somehow, such as letting in water unexpectedly... Mine did not fail, it worked flawlessly and never fogged up or anything. Every time I brought it out of the water, it still looked like it was brand new (remember to follow the instructions and, after taking it in the sea, rinse it with tap water and let it dry before opening it up). It worked underwater just like it worked in the air, without the slightest trouble. It worked so well that my girlfriend, an advanced photographer who has other more advanced/expensive cameras with specialized underwater housings, is planning to get one of these before her next snorkeling trip and use it instead.Next: Camera is decent, but not spectacular, as a happy-snap vacation camera.For all of the other things we did in Kaua'i, including sightseeing and a helicopter trip, the camera worked more or less pretty good. It worked well enough that, although I had brought my big Nikon DSLR along on the trip, I didn't end up using it hardly at all. I wish I could go back in time and tell myself: Don't bother to bring the big kid, the TG-2 will be enough.BUT... for just a plain happy-snap camera I would have been happier with one of the small Canon units. It doesn't zoom as far, doesn't respond in the UI as quickly, and doesn't have a big and bright enough LCD screen. Still... for the compromise that it manages: UNDER F'ING WATER, I think it's pretty amazing. Here's a camera that I just took INTO THE OCEAN and got great photos, and then took it sightseeing and still got pretty good photos. That's an amazing stunt.Another good point: Aperture priority.This is the only happy-snap I know with an aperture priority mode. Considering its size, it's not bad. So for some shots I can just crank open the aperture like I would on a DSLR to let the most light in for certain situations. Kind of impressive. It's doesn't magically give you DSLR quality by a long shot, but, it's not bad for what it is.Now the bad points:- No separate charger.This camera comes with a USB cable and a USB-powering wall puck. In other words, THE CAMERA IS THE CHARGER. This means that you must have the camera plugged into the wall in order to charge its battery. You cannot, for example, buy just a second battery and charge that battery independently while simultaneously using the camera with the first battery. Every other camera I've bought has a separate, independent battery charger which allows me to charge the spare battery back at the hotel while I take the camera on adventures with me. This camera does not. So when you buy this camera, look at the section that says \"customers also bought...\" and find an actual separate independent charger unit in there somewhere. I was glad I did that.- No \"stay-zoomed-while-culling\" mode on the LCD screen.One of the most useful features of many cameras (such as Nikons and Canons that I've either owned or played with) is the stay-zoomed-while-browsing feature. This is the ability to zoom into a photo to see whether it's in focus, and then to look at the next photo in the photoset while staying zoomed in, to compare the focus detail from picture to picture. Imagine this: You take five shots of the same thing, and some of them are in focus and some of them are not. You zoom in to a feature in the picture that you want to be in focus. Most cameras have an option so that you can go back and forth between the photos and see which of those photos is the most in focus, while staying zoomed in the whole time. Then you can cull the blurry ones right there, boom, done, no need to go back to the PC. Whereas with this camera, it's like I'm back in time 15 years and now I have some super-old camera. I have to zoom in, look at the focus, zoom out, go to the next picture, zoom in, look at the focus, zoom out, go to the next picture, etc. Very annoying. While we're at it, some modern cameras will even automatically cull the blurry photos for you, so this one is really behind the times.- Cheap plastic ring on the front is too easy to twist off, easy to lose, lets in sand.There is a plastic ring on the front that allows you to remove it to snap in a zoom lens. Well, that ring practically falls off. It takes only a gentle twist to unsnap it, and once, that very thing happened accidentally just as I was getting out of the car to go snorkeling. Luckily, as I was getting back in the car I saw it on the ground and I could rescue it. But it was a close call, I almost lost it.I thought at that point, \"well, I guess I don't actually need the ring, it's just for looks anyway\". And then I got the camera home, and OMG the amount of sand that I shook out of the gap that the ring covered... Man, there was a ton of sand in there. So, it seems you DO need the ring there when you're snorkeling to keep the sand out of that gap round the lens.- Slow processing speed for HDR photos.This camera has a pretty decent HDR mode! I got some really successful shots with it. But the agony of waiting for the HDR processing after each shot... ew. It takes far too long to process the HDR photos and you can't do anything with the camera while it processes.- HDR photos reduce the resolution.I only realized this after the fact: Even though I had the camera set to 3968x2976, when I did an HDR shot I noticed the resulting photos were 1920x1440. Too bad because the HDR photo results are quite decent.- Terrible in-camera panorama mode.Although it tries to guide you to line up the shots, if you don't get them lined up exactly, the borders between the frames will be terrible blurred messes. Also the camera does not try to straighten the photos out if you don't take them all perfectly lined up to the horizon. And yet it still seems to take forever to process the panoramas, much like it takes forever to process the HDR photos: You're staring at a progress bar for what seems like an eternity.- On screen menus take forever to scroll through.The most-used \"Scene\" modes that I used on this camera were, HDR, Panorama, and Sunset. (I actually really liked the Sunset mode on this camera, made the colors more vibrant.) They put HDR and Panorama next to each other in the menu, but I had to scrollscrollscrollscroll forever to get to \"sunset\". And when photographing a sunset, sometimes you're deliberately popping back and forth between HDR and Sunset for different reasons. So that's a lot of unnecessary scrolling as the precious seconds tick away and the sun slips slowly below the horizon.I know, I know, I should be doing my HDR processing, and my sunset color processing, and my panorama processing, all back at the PC.

As far as people saying it leaked the first time on a dive, etc. Well it is built to be waterproof to fifty feet or so. If you have one speck of dust or one micro fiber from a towel you just threw away your camera. Buy a housing. Treat it like you are building a space shuttle when you put it all together.

It's just not that good. I take a lot of high dynamic range (HDR) photos, and the specs said it comes with an HDR setting. What they don't tell you is that the photos are only 3MP photos. My Samsung Note smartphone takes better photos. Even standard photos are not as good as what my Samsung Note takes.Panaramics on the Stylus are a nightmare. Not matter how straight you keep the horizon, the panoramic photo it stitches together it usually \"bent\" at the ends by about 20-30 degrees. By contrast, my phone takes perfect panoramics.The menus are complicated, and so it takes a while to even dial up the setting you want. When you choose a setting at long last, you are encounted by a stock photo that hovers on the screen far too long. Perhaps there's a way to get rid of this, but do I need so see a photo of a dog blocking the view I want to photograph to know this is the dogs setting?This is supposed to be a \"tough\" camera too, but the first time I wandered into the water (the camera was never deeper than one foot deep), when I returned to shore, the ring around the lens was missing.

I'm not one to dread over photo quality too much.  From my experience, if I wanted a camera with the best quality photos, I would go with a DSLR.  I figure if I was going to buy a point and shoot camera, I would buy one that I can use in situations where I cannot use my phone.While shopping around for a durable waterproof camera, I narrowed it down to goPro or TG-2.  There are a lot of reviews out there that put all the specifications side by side for the two cameras.  I came to the conclusion that goPro would be better for videos and TG-2 would be better for photos, for my purposes.  That's not to detract photo quality from goPro and video quality from TG-2.  I was actually very impressed with the video quality from the few videos I took with it.\"Waterproofness\": I've read some reviews where some people had leaks when they used it water.  I was fighting every fiber of my being to plunge a brand new camera, or any electronics for that matter, into water to test if it could actually operate underwater.  I'm happy to report, at least with the unit I received, that it functions correctly underwater.  I did not get any leaks, and took some great picture of my tube in water.Quick Shots: One thing I was looking in my next camera is having the ability to start up the camera and take a shot fast.  Too many times I've had moments that passed where I'm waiting for my phone or camera to start, only to miss because it took so long.  With TG-2, it felt like it took about a second to start up the camera and another to take a shot.Scratches: One thing that I'm concerned with is how well the lenses hold up to scratches.  Not having the lens close when shutting the camera down worries me.  Being a durable camera, I can only hope it will hold up well.  I was not brave enough to test this by scratching the lens.Dated: This might be a minor complaint, but I felt the camera feels very dated.  Perhaps it's because I haven't own a camera in a while; mostly taking pictures with my phone, but I feels very slow and  laborious to select different modes and using the buttons to navigate.  I like the quickness of touchscreens; using buttons again to navigate the interface makes the camera feel very dated.  This, however, might be the norms with most camera, so it's more of a personal complaint.Noise: I did not think it would bother me this much.  I've read a lot of the other reviews and I was expecting the noise from zooming in and out when filming.  I also read the microphone for the camera was bad.  Knowing all of that, I was ready for the worst, or so I thought.  My main purpose is not to take videos, so I did not think it would disturb me as much as it did.  The sound is very noticeable, extremely so.  Even with all the background noise reduction turned on in the settings, I've found myself having a hard time hearing the voices over the zooming.  I suppose it bothers me so much because of how surprisingly good the video quality is.  Granted, I still believe if you want a device mainly for video, goPro would be better, I was stun by the sharpness of the video the TG-2 took.  Having such amazing video quality only to be plagued by terrible voice deeply irks me.There were other minor little things that I could talk about, but nothing too major.  I would have prefer a longer charging cable with a better adapter.  The one that came with it seems cheaply made and not what I expected.  The GPS is also not the that great, loosing signal most of the time.  The software allows for manually GPS tagging, which amend for the crappy signal, but still, could have been better implemented.  It makes the GPS and by extension, the landmark feature feel like a cheap gimmick.  The battery also did not last too long for me.  With flash, GPS, and most other features on, the battery lasted close to a day for me.  Etc.  There are also a lot of many great little things about the camera.  I like the tapping feature of it, which allow you to tap the sides of the camera to perform different actions.  I found this somewhat makes up for the touch features.Overall, I think this camera is great for what it's designed to do; take picture in somewhat extreme environments.

Get a big SD card and you should do fine.The video button just starts shooting videos like a speed demon.  You won't ever have to worry about missing any kind of shot with this camera.  Do take some time to learn how it's settings affect your shots.I made every effort to get it wet, and it performed well on my fishing trips to the lake.  My daughter's Ecuador trip resulted in many under water shots, but guess what!  She says the side connections door popped open when she slid into the water to chase turtles. She swears she checked it first, but camera drowned.  I sent it back to Olympus with this story, and they replaced it with a refurbished model within a week. I had a red one, they returned a black one, but I love it just the same or better, because the black looks \"tougher\".  The red one looks like a piece of jewelry.That side door DOES pop open, as it is spring loaded, despite the double lock feature.  I bought a neoprene cover, but it has holes for the 2 access doors.  In a separate review, I will state, as here, who needs the access doors 'accessible' during rough play?  I'd like the cover to 'cover' the entire camera, which might assist in preventing this.Overall, I love the camera, and when I get the zoom lens, the rating should go to 5 stars.", "Date": "July 7, 2013"}, {"Title": "Good Product", "Author": "Francisco Rosales Rueda", "ReviewID": "R2C2P288MVJWRZ", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "Haven't been able to try it underwater yet, but its great for taking clinical pictures and some insects too, lol i still haven't figured out why when i take the picture on macro mode and then i wanna zoom in on my PC the picture pixelates faster, but mehhhh good enought for the price, just need to figure out how to get a microscope adapter for this cam", "Date": "July 6, 2013"}, {"Title": "love it", "Author": "Audball", "ReviewID": "R2N4IR6GF19BB3", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I only have two complaints about this camera.

It still works fine.I bought this one because it was a significant improvement over my old 8010.  It was certainly worth it - while it worked.  The pictures were good.  Start up was fast.  Pictures were of fine quality.  The noise on the video is noticeable, but not worse than my old 8010.  I also don't take a lot of video with this camera, and the ones that I do are of my kids playing, and the camera noise isn't noticeable in those videos.My issue is that the build quality of this camera seems to not be even close of the old one.  My old 8010 is very solid.  I also like its cover for the lens.  This one feels like a toy.  And on day three of my vacation, the screen stopped turning on.  It now only displays a greenish haze.  I've tried resetting it, leaving the battery out, etc, but nothing seems to be working.  Also Olympus doesn't have it's troubleshooting / support area up for this camera yet.  I'm  sending it back as being defective, so hopefully I got a bum unit.  Lucky for me, I brought my old 8010 with me so I will just drop my sd card into that unit and continue taking pictures.

First, this will not replace your DSLR (Mine's a Sony A65 and I love it.)  The even though I use class 10 SD cards, the write speed of this camera is much slower than my 24 megapixel DSLR.  Further, you really need to practice the various settings before beginning taking pictures.  The camera has a learning curve.  By this I mean that not all settings allow all features.  For instance, you cannot set the auto to take multiple shots.  This means that when you attempt to capture a sequence off a water slide you have to know to set it to program and then choose one of two setting for multiple shots.  Otherwise, you get take a picture and it displays the picture for couple of seconds before allowing the next shot.However, I do not want to take my DSLR on all outings.  Given this, I can live with the trade-offs.  I'll just keep the camera in Program mode most of the time.Update:I took my grand kids to an even two weeks ago.  Since it was a conference with a children's program, I passed the camera off with the instructions to just let any kid use the camera.  All the children were in 1st through 6th grade.  I was able to upload to the Instagram website for other conference goers to see the children's perspective without worrying if the camera would be ruined.  The kids had fun playing with it and were even able to 'toy' with different modes.  The camera is definitely the right purchase for this year's planned fun.  I don't have to worry about drops, spills, rain, or other issues with young children borrowing my camera.Update:Just got back from Jamaica.  Night shots with the flash were over exposed!  I had to 'step down' the settings and adjust in various programs to get the pictures to look correct.  The camera does great as long as the flash is not needed at night.

The battery charges inside the camera and you must connect the camera to the battery charger via USB cable and then connect the charger to the USB-AC adapter. All are proprietary.

Well, I'm a frequent traveler and as all travelers know, the amount of crap we have haul around to keep our computers, notebooks, cameras, MP3 players, Kindles, phones, etc charged is absurd. The last thing I want in a new camera is three more pieces of auxiliary equipment to pack and track. My other cameras (Canon and Panasonic--this is my first Olympus) have small chargers that plug directly into the power source. Is there a good reason why Olympus can't follow suit? I realize it's a relatively minor matter, but it was enough that I seriously considered returning the camera.1/26/14 update: I bought spare batteries and a plug-in charger, so that problem is solved. However, I finally got around to charging and installing a battery & the camera doesn't function.

I had to send it Oympus, instead, under the warranty. I hope they can repair or replace it for me.

This camera competes with and smashes on the latest Digital SLR cameras.This camera...will fit in your pocket, a DSLR cannot.-can be dropped from 7 feet, good luck with your DSLR.-is water proof, there is no chance your DSLR will hold up to water.-The manufacturers want you to get your DSLR wet because they are designed to break. Thus they'll make a quick thousand off of you when you buy a replacement.-is freeze-proof, very useful if you want to take pictures on a snowy day or leave it in the car overnight on a cold night.-is dust proof, well just watch what happens to your DSLR if you get some saw-dust on there, it probably won't turn on anymore.-is also crush proof, apparently a 220 pound person could stand on this thing and it's fine.My last point and shoot camera was the Canon G10 which easily performed the same way as a DSLR and I'd say this camera takes equal pictures to that, with a little bit less control.The button placement is all correct, and the internal computer is very good.COMPLAINTS:The only complaints I have about this, compared to that, are that it lacks Manual mode and Shutter-Speed priority mode.This won't be your ideal camera to take out and do a long exposure of the stars.It also has C1 and C2 on its wheel style mode selector, that DO NOT SAVE. (Or I have yet to figure out how)Pretty annoying when I want my custom modes to exclude flash and every time I turn the thing on I have to shut off the flash.Normally cameras also have built in option to change the pictures colors (such as sepia, or B&W;), this doesn't have that.I have had difficulty doing ANYTHING with the videos. For some reason Olympus doesn't want you to be able to import them to your computer, or to the internet, you may only view them on the camera or in Olympus Viewer. What the ****? I'm sure there is a way around it but they sure don't make it easy because I have yet to find the proper solution.If you consider yourself a photographer of any caliber, I recommend this to you. You WILL find it replacing your DSLR.Don't catch yourself saying \"I wish I brought my camera.\" This one you can bring with you everywhere.", "Date": "March 7, 2013"}, {"Title": "All Purpose Camera", "Author": "C.
