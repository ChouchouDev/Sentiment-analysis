I mostly use it as a point-and-shoot camera with the Auto mode. The auto focus is fast enough. I had used it to take picture from the window of a running train.  It performed well on the focus and also the shutter speed.  I chose it also because it uses the BSI CMOS sensor, not the FSI CMOS sensor nor the CCR sensor.  It does come out very nice and clear pictures. One more thing that I have to say is the feature of using dry cell batteries.  You do not need to worry about the power source and time to recharge the battery during your trip.  It consumes power very efficiently.  I took more than 300 pictures in 3 trips and still using the first 4 batteries.", "Date": "September 9, 2013"}, {"Title": "Pleasantly surprised!", "Author": "Ron", "ReviewID": "R3R7SGRJLEEX56", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "Though I never owned a Fuji before, I purchased a Fujifilm FinePix AX560 at Wal-Mart  for $69.00 about a year ago, on the advice of the salesgirl. Wasn't disappointed. So I decided to see what Fuji could do in a higher price range. And because this model is so new, I could not find any reviews, anywhere.Well, here's my review: For the price range, this camera is TERRIFIC !Shot to shot time, is almost instantaneous.Color rendition is almost spot-on.I've taken hundreds of photos, and the re-chargeable batteries I originally inserted, are still going strong.Fine details are captured beautifully.There just seems to be \"life\" to the photos.I tried the 30X  zoom, and the pics. were good, but I can't fault the camera, as I didn't use a tripod and my hands tend to be a little shaky.In fact, I took some photo's at a local farm stand today, and e-mailed a few to my sister. Her reply was,\" I don't know what kind of camera you used, but, WOW.\"I guess that says it all.I only wish I could post some of the photo's here.In my opinion, at this price range, worth every penny!", "Date": "October 14, 2013"}, {"Title": "Great Camera", "Author": "KEEROCK LEE", "ReviewID": "R11E8ETHH0A6OZ", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I purchased this camera for my kid's birthday present which I have intended for all the family to use together.This is great camera, of course, zoom 30 x enables you to take any objects in distance without having to carry the heavy telescope lens for dlsi camera.

I was searching the well known brands and a co-worker referred me to Fuji.  She said she had purchased a similar style a couple of years ago and said that the picture quality was excellent.  She also stated that the camera was very user friendly.Before she recommended Fuji it never crossed my mind to purchase that brand.  All my previous cameras have been Canon or Sony.  My most recent was a Sony Cybershot which I liked a lot until it started giving me problems which is the reason I was in the market to purchase a new camera.  I'm so very glad I was opened minded and decided to research the Fujifilm S6800.  It's newly released (March 2013) and the functions were exactly what I was looking for and then some.  I've only had the camera for a little over a week and only taken test shots.  The picture quality is spot on.  The real test comes next week when I go on vacation.  I will do an updated review then.

Some pictures come out as over exposed.

It is much better than what I've suffered through in the past with cameras in the same price range so I do have to give it a thumbs up, but I would expect someone that wanted perfect low light pictures will simply need to come out of pocket for a $400 or $500 camera.

Don't get me wrong, it's a nice camera, however the image quality is not quite what I was expecting or hoping for.  I purchased this b/c I do a lot of genealogy and I wanted a camera that would be able to take good quality document photos b/c quite honestly it's faster than printouts, less wasteful, more easily transferable, and cheaper (yes, I really despise paying $1-$2/printout depending on location).What I have found however is that it just isn't up to that ability.  I have tried and it has unfortunately failed at that task.  Most of the photos come out blurry.  And I've noticed there's a gradient.  Writing is clear at the center of the photo, but as you go further out things get blurrier until the edges are completely unreadable.  So I end up with half I can read and half I can't.The photos/vids it takes are decent.  Not overly high quality, but good enough.

I was happy about the reviews and the price of this camera, which seemed to have met my wants and needs in a camera. The camera does not have an actual eyepiece when taking a photo and the focus was the worse focus I have ever experienced with a camera, extremely out of focus with a low quality being the result. I found myself trying different modes and searching for a way to make it work, even resorting to online forums that spoke furthermore about this product. To my dismay, I ended up returning it and getting a refund for my purchase. The material of the camera felt cheap and plastic, it looks cheap, I wouldn't recommend this camera to anyone.

Its really fast. Auto focus seems OK. But the camera just feels cheap in my hands. Especially compared to my Nikon p510.

As it doesn't have eye-fi SD card control, I can't disable the wifi like in my Nikon so that is always eating at the AA batteries.

Indoors (with window shades open & sunlight coming in) the pictures were very noisy, not even acceptable. Outdoors the pictures were much better with little noise but still choosing a higher iso resulting in slightly more noise than my Samsung Galaxy Note II.
