After trying it out on a skiing trip I was pleased with the fast shooting, the long battery life, true colors and textures.

Love the AA Battery feature...no charger to take along on trips. You can buy backup batteries almost anywhere.  For a AA camera it has a long battery life.  I am using rechargables I bought on Amazon. The complaint about the plastic camera body made me laugh.  My $1200.00 Olympus Mr Bulky is all plastic so is the interior on my $40,000.00 Pickup. So why expect more from a $100.00 camera. The only comlaint is that the SD card is in the same compartment as the AA batteries. Not a deal breaker for me, but kind of inconvenient.  Photos are excellent, sharp bright colors.  I didn't buy this for the video feature however it has better sound quality than my wifes $500.00 camcorder.  I was amazed. Love the telephoto viewfinder feature. If you are looking for an economical, take along camera that does a decent job this is it.", "Date": "May 28, 2013"}, {"Title": "LOVE THIS CAMERA!", "Author": "John Orban", "ReviewID": "R19HUBYYZT7RGF", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I bought four of these (prior version) cameras for school and one for the school auction/dance (auctioned off with 4 hours of my time for photo instruction, etc.).Anyhow - I LOVE these cameras. AA batts so I don't have to worry about whether the camera is charged or not. (I have a PowerShot SX210 with two lithium batts, personally. But for school, recharging batts is no good - the cameras might sit on the shelf for a while and lose charge and I don't want to buy extra $60 batts for them.)So...kids use them, mostly, to shoot videos. Being able to take the SCCard out of the camera and put it into a small SD Card reader is just so easy. Forget about the USB cable. Most laptops now come with SD slots in them so you can pop the card out of the camera and into your laptop - how much easier is that??I think this is an EXCELLENT --> ENTRY LEVEL <-- camera for kids, particularly; but, really, anyone who wants to start learning about photography. Yeah, it lacks a lot of bells and whistles a lot of the other P&S; cameras have, but that's GREAT because there is nothing to distract you from learning how to \"see\" a good photo and learn all about the \"photographer's eye\".I've also felt that it's good not having too much stuff on a device because then you can really learn what you are missing and KNOW what to look for when you're ready to move up to the next level.I think a lot of folks \"overbuy\" in a camera, especially, and then either get frustrated with it because there just is too much to learn or, worse, just don't use the camera.The price is right - the camera is more than capable of taking great photos. I plan to buy some more for the school.", "Date": "March 16, 2013"}, {"Title": "Awesome camera for the money", "Author": "Dan J", "ReviewID": "R37HLDXYNFUCN2", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I was looking for a camera that had the following criteria:Universal AA or AAA batteries (not proprietary Li-ion or other technologies), HD Video recordingLightweight, \"easy to use\" and not that many buttons, and inexpensiveThis camera meets my criteria.(1) Here's a further explanation of the battery issue:The problem with Li-ion batteries is that once a manufacture changes the battery pack and no longer makes the battery it becomes hard to find. Li-ion batteries have a shelf life of about 2 years (from the data of manufacture) & if they haven't been charged in that time frame, they will not last very long. Once they are fully discharged they may not \"recover\". You could end up buying a new battery pack and only getting at best 4-6 shots before needing a recharge.The Canon A1400 uses 2 AA batteries. My preference is two use Sanyo (now Panasonic) Eneloop NiMH (Nickel Metal Hydride) Rechargeable batteries. I have over 5 years of experience using these throughout the household. They can be recharged from 1500 to 1800 times (depends on the series) and can hold up to 90% of their charge for up to a year. I carry two in the camera and two as spares in a compact camera case (Case Logic DBC-302 purchased here on Amazon as an \"add-on\" purchase and therefore discounted).With Alkaline batteries you can take up to 150 (screen on), 200 (ECO mode), or 500 (screen off) still shots (less if you use flash and/or zoom a-lot or playback (review) shots. With NiMH rechargeable, the number of shots increase to 500 (screen on), 600 (ECO mode) or up to 1100 (screen off). In Screen off mode, you use the built-in viewfinder - which is becoming increasingly difficult to find in an \"entry-level\" camera.(2) You can quickly change the default picture size from 16MP (default) to 8MP, 2MP, 0.3MP (VGA) or Widescreen using the \"Func./Set\" button on the back of the camera.(3) The camera includes digital (not optical) image stabilization (IS) which is better than nothing. For still images without a tripod or slow moving scenes, it works fairly well. For fast action scenes, the camera takes 3 shots and then chooses the best one to use. Again for the price you pay it would be hard to find a point and shoot camera that uses optical image stabilization.(4) You can record (make) movies in 720p resolution. This was another reason that I wanted this camera. I have a larger DSLR (Olympus E-620) and 5 lenses to go with it that is great for shooting a lot of different kinds of pictures (close-up, far away or fast action), but it does not have the ability to record (make) a movie. So this camera fills a void and does so at a nice price point. It's a good daily or spur of the moment camera.(5) I wish it came with a printed manual, a USB cable and at least a 1 or 2 GB SD card but it came with none of these items. It does come with a wrist strap and a pair of alkaline batteries. Fortunately, I was able to download the manual and use a 2 GB (class 4) & 16 GB (class 10) SD card that I had laying around at home. It works well with either density or speed.(6) Although it does not come with software, you can download some free software at the Canon website that allows you to import pictures from the camera with a USB cable or through a USB card reader to:  Manage/Print the images, and Edit the pictures as follows:(a) Correct Red-eye,(b) Auto Correct,(c) Adjust color and Brightness,(d) Increase Sharpness,(e) Crop Image,(f) Insert Text,(g) Stitch photos (to create a panoramic photo),(h) Edit Movies, and(i) Extract Multiple images from Movie (this feature alone makes the \"free\" software worthy enough of a download/install.The software works on Windows (from 95 to 8.1), Mac OS 8 to OS X 10.9, and Linux (something for everyone).To get the software, go to the Canon website, click on Support, pick a region of the world and then a country, then \"Consumer & Home office\", then \"Powershot cameras\", then \"Powershot A series\", and finally scroll down & select the \"Powershot A1400\" camera. Once there, you'll be able to download the user manuals, guides and/or brochures as well as the software.On balance this is a great entry level camera with a lot of useful bells and whistles (features). I recommend that you download one or both of the searchable PDF manuals. It takes decent pictures & easily slips into your pocket (but I prefer to use a compact camera case more for protection than anything else). It comes with a wrist strap, a pair of alkaline AA batteries and a 1 year warranty. Its a camera for all ages.Like anything, the more you use the camera in different settings & modes the better you get at using it. The \"auto\" mode is nice when there is plenty of light, it's also a great learning tool as you get to see what the camera chose on your behalf. You can also turn off the digital zoom and rely only on the 5x optical zoom.If you find that you need more flash \"light\" (something that extends the flash range up to 30 feet), look at the Canon HF-DC1 that sells for around $52 here on Amazon. It's triggered by the built-in flash (recall that light travels pretty fast) and can come in handy.As with every camera product, you can spend more money and get something better but at every price point you can make that decision. For me the last criteria is that the camera was inexpensive and this camera also meets that criteria. Good luck with your search & or purchase.UPDATED 04-26-2014This camera uses a 32-bit image processor that has a 4 GB file size limit, so when you are shooting video's (movie) continuously the camera will stop after the 4 GB file size is reached.In HD Quality 1280 x 720p (25 fps - frames per second), the length of the movie is around 27:18.In SD Quality  480 x 640p (30 fps - frames per second), the length of the movie is around 50:10.Note this limit is not just a Canon limit rather most cameras have this limit unless they are using a 64-bit processor. It's generally not an issue with most people, myself included as I generally take video's from 5 seconds to 15-20 minutes.When I try & compose a close up shot, I will sometimes switch to movie mode and make a 3-5 second video clip, then use the free software that you can download and extract stills (photo's) from the video clip & I am bound to find one that I like a lot.This is an awesome camera for the money.UPDATED 05-26-2014I purchased a 2nd A1400 because I like the first one so much and wanted to have a backup.I've used the camera in very low light settings, taking pictures and video clips of \"Disney On Ice\" in a box seat some 100-200 feet away from the skaters. The booth like the arena was dimly lit: wall sconces, step lights and exit signs provide what little light there was for safety reasons. The only other lights were above the skaters where spot/flood lights of varying colors lit up parts of the arena. The camera has a 5.0x optical zoom (shows up in white) and an additional 4x of digital zoom (shows up in blue). I set the camera for 5.0x optical and would take photos that turned out nicely, but for the most part I shot video clips. When shooting video you have no additional optical zoom except for what you initially set the camera with. Any more zoom is digital (which is akin to cropping the image). Still I was able to get very nice video clips. When I got home, I used the free ImageBrowserEX software that you can download from Canon here: www.usa.canon.com/cusa/support/consumer/digital_cameras/powershot_a_series/powershot_a1400#DriversAndSoftware and extracted extracted stills (photos) from the video clips. Incidentally this method works great when trying to take pictures of kids running around. You can extract up to 25 photos per second in HD 1280 x 720p mode, from the video clips and you are bound to find many that you will like.It's best if you can to read the manual to take full advantage of all the bell's and whistles that the camera has to offer. You can find the manual here: gdlp01.c-wss.com/gds/0/0300010040/01/ps-a1400-a2600-cu-en.pdfYou have to supply your own SD card (Class 6 or higher, and densities up to 32 GB). I use a 16 GB Class 10 SD card.You can transfer the photo's to the computer via a standard Type A male USB to Type B male mini USB cable or via the SD card itself. If your computer lacks an SD Card reader, you can use one like this: http://www.amazon.com/IOGEAR-MicroSD-Reader-Writer-GFR204SD/dp/B0046TJG1U/ref=cm_cr_pr_product_to which sells for $5.95 here on Amazon.The recommend case, Case Logic DCB-302 which sells for $5.99 here on Amazon http://www.amazon.com/Case-Logic-DCB-302-Compact-Camera/dp/B003F7DWH8/ref=cm_cr_pr_product_top protects the camera nicely in the main zippered pouch and with the front zippered pouch can store from 4-6 additional batteries, a couple of SD cards and the SD to USB adapter with room for a few more things.I have been using Sanyo Eneloop NiMH rechargeable batteries for more than 5 years and have no complaints. I use a pair in the Canon A1400 camera and carry 4 in the camera case. They recharge in pairs in about 7 hours and come with charger in the 4-pack which sells for under $25 here on Amazon. http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B004SB1TD4/ref=oh_details_o04_s00_i00?ie=UTF8&psc;=1This is an awesome camera and value for the money.", "Date": "February 26, 2014"}, {"Title": "The only point and shot pocket camera with a viewfinder", "Author": "Rob Reppert", "ReviewID": "R3IR24H2WJQO6G", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "Being able to use the view finder and turning off the back screen saves batteries.

It fits in a big pocket, or in a small belt pouch - take your choice. (Since I was traveling in pick-pocket areas, I put it in my pocket and kept my hand in my pocket too.)I am VERY pleased. It comes on almost instantaneously, and it also focuses quickly and shoots fast, recovering in less than a second for the next shot.Film speed is good, defaults to 1600. Not exactly for night photography, but low-light is no problem at all.The viewfinder (thanks Canon) is for me indispensable, since LED screens are so hard to see in daylight (not to mention having to get out my reading glasses). I wish other vendors would add the viewfinder back in, but Canon seems to be the last holdout.Another thing I REALLY like for traveling is the AA batteries. Yeah, you have to buy batteries, but you do not have to carry a charger around (and of course forget to charge your spare battery, as we all will eventually do). This only uses two AA's, and they last a LONG time, maybe 500-1000 (non-flash) photos or thereabouts.Highly recommended.", "Date": "June 2, 2013"}, {"Title": "Terrific little camera", "Author": "P.

Using Lithium batteries, my wife only needed to change batteries once while taking approximately 1500 pictures.  Camera is very lightweight.  It isn't the smallest camera available (due to AAs) but still easy to fit in pocket or small camera bag.The only complaints I have relate to the multi-function button-wheel on the back.  First, the wheel is slightly recessed and it was a bit challenging to make selections with my fingers.  My wife didn't have any problems.  Secondly, we often pressed the flash selection button when pulling the camera out of its case.  This caused several times where we accidentally activated the flash when not needed, then had to wait a few seconds for the recharge before we could take the next picture.Overall, a great little camera.

However, I was able to get a nice night time shot in a well-lit marina by turning off the flash and setting the camera on something solid. There is definitely more noise in the photo, but the exposure came out far better than expected. Zooming in to just about any degree, even in good light, significantly adds to the amount of noticeable noise. In video mode, don't even think of using the zoom. Leave it in the widest angle setting or you'll be disappointed in how much noise there is. If you are shooting video into the general direction of the sun and there is any sort of reflection of the sun, say on the water, you will get horribly obvious and obtrusive vertical bars (about 1/8\" wide on the LCD) streaming through the image that will totally ruin the shot you were after. The sensor obviously can't handle that sort of exposure. My iPhone has handled similar exposure with no problems at all. Also, in video mode, the optical viewfinder does not show the effects of the zoom button. The image remains at the widest setting no matter what you do with the zoom button. If you plan to use the zoom in video mode, you MUST use the LCD on the back of the camera to frame your shot. If you use the optical viewfinder and then zoom in, you'll have absolutely no idea what your are capturing. This camera should basically only be used for general landscape photos in good light, or perhaps for basic indoor snapshots with the flash. I got it for free and will probably give it away and look for something better to use as a point-and-shoot when I don't feel like lugging my Nikon DSLR along.", "Date": "August 16, 2013"}, {"Title": "Last Value Camera with Optical Viewfinder", "Author": "David Jones", "ReviewID": "R1W5RHGVRYMMFP", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "Photos and exposure settings on the Canon A1400 are superior to smartphones.  Having the optical view finder allows for more steady shots; since, my head does not shake as much as my extended arms.

My image quality comparisons at ASA 100 were made using a tripod with both cameras.  Also, how can one beat using light weight 9X-life lithium AA batteries that last for hundreds of photos and image reviews?  Furthermore, when comparing the A1400 to the smartphone, there is a flash which reaches 10 feet or more.  So you should buy one of these before Canon pulls more models from the market.

To be honest they pretty much look the same as my 7 year old camera. However this camera has a setting to take full HD pics which is a major plus. I've seen some people complain about grainy pictures. This is probably because they took it right out of the box and just started snapping pics. There are a few adjustments you need to make on this camera to get good quality photos. First of all, turn the iso setting down to either 100, 200 or 400. This will fix the grainy pictures. The iso setting is jacked way up when you take it out of the box and it makes the pics look like crap. So play around with this camera for 3 or 4 hours before you give up on it. It's not a bad camera at all. You'll just need to test some of the different settings out. This thing has full screen HD video as well.

I was pleasantly surprised when i opened the box and saw that all the buttons and controls were designed in a very simple way. It's like the camera was made for the technologically impaired. It even has a help button with a ? on it. Very simple and easy to understand. Perfect for mom! I only gave 4 stars because it did not come with a memory card or a cable to connect it to the computer.

Sometimes, when you travel near or far, it's nice to know you have a very adequate backup when your main camera might have an accident? My SX260 is very nice (has a sturdy metal case, full hd, 20x zoom, fantastic!)  BUT the A1400 has a CCD sensor while my SX260 uses the CMOS (the CCD type sensor gives you  a better quality picture). Also, the A1400 has a larger 16.1 Megapixel effective image size but the SX260 only has 12.1 megapixels (interesting?). Even the newer SX280 model keeps those same CMOS & 12.1 megapixel sensors?I really love the view finder on the A1400 (on so many occasions, that sun is directly overhead) and unless you have one of those \"TILT LCDs\", it drives me crazy to clearly see what I'm trying to film? And of course, the double AA battery power (for colder areas, you can buy some extra lithium to prevent any freeze-up) is fantastic. You can get double AAs anywhere, plus most of us have the Eneloop rechargeables?This camera is small & lite and will fit in most pockets, especially anything like cargo shorts. The camera gives great still pics & the HD is fine but of course my SX260 is way better in anything with video. Yet, I know my little backup camera will provide me with nice pics & HD vids wherever I am, if my main camera ever stops working properly! Finally, around ($60.) for a nice, new Canon camera, this was a real easy choice for me?-------------------------------------------TIPS:?01 - I use a leftover (rock the frogskins, pacific blue / Oakley nylon sunglass bag/pouch, looks really good!) to cover/protect the camera/lens. Of course, these bags are the micro type & nice if you ever have to wipe some speck of dust/dirt off your lense. For me, the nylon pouch is fine for this small backup and they sell them at any mall.02 - 2 extra slim case, Sandisk 32gb SDHC cards with the camera, easily fit in this bag.03 - Also, Amazon sells these cool \"PowerPax Storacell Slim Line\" AA battery caddies & they work great.  Their orange color will make a nice contrast and they have many other colors available?04 - Another nice thing about this camera is that the insides, actually have markings for the proper way to face your memory card & batteries. My SX260 doesn't, so if I haven't used it for awhile (markings would be helpful?). The A1400 can also use the higher capacity SDXC, eXtra capacity memory card. For me, this newer SDXC card is great, 64 or 128GB, you can movie forever. Yet, my old VISTA system isn't fond of it, I have to use one of those USB computer cords to download (AMAZON, sells an A1400 cord for around $6.00). It immediately loads the (JPEC & MOV), no problem. Then, I'll double-click the \"MOV\" and Apples Quicktime will convert, I'll login to Utube where the movie file is converted to an \"MP4\" format, so easier to manage!05 - Lastly, sometimes you might be taking pics around water (a boat ride under the Golden Gate or the surf around some rocky beach - lots of spray), nevermind it might be one of those drizzle days? If your just taking tourist or web shots, why risk getting moisture on the lens or in-between the zoom mechanism of your best camera, use the A1400 (16.1 megapixels) ain't bad and I'm thinking of buying another (just for this reason alone?).-------------------------------------------SX280:1080p/60p Full HD videoWith the camera's advanced DIGIC 6 Image Processor enabling \"MP4\" format recording, the PowerShot SX280 HS lets you shoot video at a selectable frame rate of 60 fps or 30 fps. 1080p/60p Full HD video is extraordinarily smooth and rich in playback, ensuring that your important memories and creative film clips look their absolute best. Video recorded at 30 fps has also been improved through the combination of the DIGIC 6 Image Processor and Fine Movie Detail Processing, with reduced noise and high resolution.-------------------------------------------", "Date": "December 29, 2013"}, {"Title": "Disappointing", "Author": "Patrick Swerkstrom", "ReviewID": "RP0VRFSPFY2O8", "Overall": "2.0", "Content": "Canon is gradually eliminating all of the control features that have made their point and shoot cameras my first choice.

The cover for it feels like it can snap off at any time. The batteries and flashcard slot are in the same area and whenever one wants to take out the flashcard, the batteries seem to want to pop out. You have to be really careful when closing the slot, as it is flimsy and the hinge is not solid at all and the batteries push out a little bit when you open it, so I can see how this could break off if you aren't very careful with it.. The usb port worked for a while, so I didn't have to take the flashcard out to transfer pictures, but now it doesn't seem to work. The covering for the usb port also feels like it can snap off if not treated gently. The camera also didn't come with a usb cable, so you'll have to buy one unless you want to deal with the flashcard/battery slot issue all the time. For a camera that is advertised as 16 MP the picture quality is terrible. My really old 2.4 MP camera takes higher quality shots, though this may be due to the optics used.

The lens covers and mechanism that opens and closes the lens have been the point of breakage on both previous cameras.I prefer Powershots mainly because I'm now pretty familiar with using them.  I like the optical view finder, because I have trouble seeing the digital screen that most cameras provide as the only way to frame the shot.  If you are not over 45 yet, you will understand that remark later in life.The camera has a large bundle of features, most of which I've never used.  Once I've configured it, I don't like to mess around with settings in the field, and this camera does the basics without needing any more attention.I think these are a good value for people needing high quality snapshots of action events.  There is a frustrating delay between pushing the shutter button and capturing the shot, which gets worse as the batteries wear out and when the flash is needed.  However, this has been consistently observed on other brands of camera as well.I take ALOT of pictures, so I prefer the AA batteries used in this camera, which can be replaced in the field.  2 AA batteries will cover me for about 200 photos, which is plenty good for one event.  I carry a couple spare sets of AA's in the camera case, and consider myself ready for anything.  The camera is compact and its case fits comfortably on my belt, or in some cases hooked to a belt loop with a mini-snaplink.", "Date": "June 15, 2013"}, {"Title": "Flash has to charge between shots", "Author": "StoicPlatypus", "ReviewID": "R1YU43USYEK67J", "Overall": "3.0", "Content": "Disclaimer: I purchased my camera through Kmart.I bought the PowerShot A1400 because I wanted a simple point and shoot camera.

It's a delay of about 2-3 seconds but it's just enough to interrupt shooting, especially if there's a lot of activity you're trying to capture.  So that's a big drawback for me.It does take nice quality photos.On the pros, it's very light (plastic case), uses a standard SD cards but also has an A/V output in case you don't have a card reader handy, and I like the optical zoom.  I think it also takes video.

In this case different from the previous Canon A series that I own.  I finally found one - the fifth in my collection of USB cables. It would not hurt to include a \"starter\" memory card, for anyone who does not have any.NOW, WHY THE HELL can't Canon include a hardcopy manual (small) and a cable (also small) with the camera?Seems like they are behaving like Apple.

Indoor quality is mediocre and the video zoom is digital only, so your picture starts to look like an early Nintendo style scene as you zoom in on your subject.However, if you just want an inexpensive camera to take outdoor / well lit pictures and you aren't doing anything fancy, this one will work just fine. I just got back from a vacation during which I shot over 250 pictures on one set of batteries which are still in the camera. The eco setting turns off the screen on the back so you just use the viewfinder, and I love having a viewfinder on a point and shoot.If I had one serious problem, it would be that the actual picture taken is about 10-15% larger than what you see in the viewfinder, so you have to guess when you compose your picture, then review if you really want it right.Overall, this is a fine everyday carry camera that does its job with a minimum of fuss and expense.

If you extend it all the way out to 20x (max), the photos are very grainy and have some color separation. The display makes everything look pixelated; the photos look better on the computer than they do on your LCD. As with every camera I've owned, the flash drains the living essence from the batteries in about 5 or 6 shots. The recovery time is slow. If you want to take pictures of scenery or buildings or statues, this camera is probably worth your money.

I could have gotten the cheaper A2500 model but I stuck with this one because of the design which has a better hand  grip and the viewfinder unlike the flat a2500 which easily slip out of one's hands. Also feature wise , there isn't much difference between the a2500 and a1400 Picture quality is good for the camera but it does struggle in low light settings. it was also quite surprisingly small and can fit in a chest pocket. video recording quality is good at 720p HD recording  with excellent audio recording and playback. it is relatively easy to setup and can just leave it on auto to do it own thing. There are so many settings to toy with ,experiment and configure to get the desired effect. All in all ,I am enjoying my new camera and hope it stay functional.

Now to change modes and go through the menus you must negotiate a confusing, complicated relationship between two buttons which I have yet to master consistently.  They eliminated the dial on top because it was easy to accidentally change modes, but I had long since learn to check it so for me it was an unnecessary and unwelcome 'fix.'  The viewfinder to me is essential for composing shots and getting hard to find. I keep the display turned off and the batteries last forever.

Digital cameras are so affordable now that there is no reason not to have a decent camera camera with you when you are on vacation or doing something with the kids.I bought this camera for my adult daughter (35 years old, married and with two children) for Christmas when they were all visiting me.  They shot over a hundred photos when they visited the San Antonio Sea World; the River Walk and several other local attractions.  The photos were far superior to cell phone pics due to the camera's zoom lens, it's better resolution and the fact that it has a viewfinder, which I think is much better for photographic composition.Among the features that I liked about this camera is that it uses AA batteries instead of a proprietary rechargeable battery.  This can be very helpful for the occasional photographer, especially when they are traveling.

It costs about a quarter of the price that I paid for my camcorder back in 2008, which only took 8 megapixel pictures.  The thinness of this camera is ideal, which makes it easy to take this camera with you on the go.  The videos I have uploaded to YouTube do not have the static noise my old camera made, so this is a plus.  I also liked that it came with batteries, which gives me a bit of time before I go out and buy rechargeable AA batteries.  I highly recommend purchasing rechargeable batteries because this will save you money in the long run.The Cons:One reviewer said you can take the memory card out of the camera and stick it in your computer to upload the pictures, but I have several reservations about this. Plugging a USB cord into the camera to upload the pictures is actually easier than opening up the camera to pull out the memory card, and then opening the slot to stick it in the computer. The memory card made my computer freeze up as the pictures were uploading, which might be because my laptop is from 2009, but it still was a hassle. The camera really should have came with a USB connection cord, but thankfully I have one.  People who are not as tech savvy will have a difficulty with this issue, and I would never make the assumption as a manufacturer everyone can figure out how to upload the pictures without a manual, which brings me to the next issue.  Its seems a little on the cheap side not to include a manual, and to tell the user to go download it from the manufacturer's website.  I have not done that because it is an extra step, and these directions are assuming that everyone who purchases this camera has an Internet connection.  So people might have to go to a library or a cafe to use the WiFi, and do they want to spend the time to download the manual?  I was able to figure out the basic functions of the camera without doing that, but if it means raising the price of the camera by a few dollars to include a USB cord and manual, I actually think it might be helpful.", "Date": "February 5, 2014"}, {"Title": "Poor picture", "Author": "Jamie M Boyd", "ReviewID": "R3N87MVTV08XFP", "Overall": "2.0", "Content": "Bought this for my wife (she loves pictures).She was VERY dissatisfied with it and had to return.Has pore picture quality and flash is SLOW.DID NOT met expectations from other reviews.", "Date": "December 29, 2013"}, {"Title": "Love it", "Author": "Amazon Customer", "ReviewID": "R1B853KF0HIRZT", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "I just love my new camera.

The use of standard batteries is also a big plus when traveling and not always having access to a power point to recharge a rechargeable internal battery.

It may be great and I intend to get back with more comments on how the camera performs. This is about what to expect.I got a great price from Amazon and have absolutely no complaints in that regard. I bought this model because I needed a camera with more pixels than the one I already own, an eight megapixel Canon A590. This A590 camera has been outstanding. Ironically, it now sells for more than three times what I purchased it for. This seems unique! The only reason I can make is that Canon stopped making the model and there is still demand. My hope is that the A1400 serves equally well.Regardless of what reviewers say concerning how easy a digital camera is to use, I think there are so many features that it is imperative to have a print manual on hand, particularly at the outset. The Canon A590 came with one. That was NOT the case with the A1400. Although a manual was not listed as coming with the camera, it was my mistake to think of it as pro forma. To get a .PDF version, a Canon Web address was given but was useless since no connection could be made. At one point it was listed as a danger to my computer!I did a search for the A1400 manual in .PDF, finding one through Ask.com. I downloaded it (120+ pages), but in so doing I omitted to check a box. This near fatal flaw led to my home page getting hi-jacked by Ask. This is a common problem as I discovered and no easy thing to correct. Firefox has a whole load of complaints with this same lament, along with myriad suggestions to get rid of hated Ask.com ... which may or may not work. I found one on YouTube and it did work; all kinds of wasted time and aggravation.The .PDF manual is for TWO cameras not one. How cheap can Canon get?! Once downloaded it is easy to read, no better or worse than others. NO PRINT version can be obtained. In my view this is a major omission. In parallel, I recently upgraded my cell phone. The manual for it is 179+ pages. You have to go through a few hoops to get a print version, but I did get one. My son-in-law says all companies are going the non-print route. If so, it is hateful in my opinion. Canon could get tons of PR goodwill if a print manual was in the offing, a possibly big advantage over the competition; even if the manual is for two, three or four cameras.I don't agree with reviewers who say this camera is \"easy to use.\" All kinds of signs and symbols come up which are different than the A590 and, for all that, may make this new model better. However, it's a waste of time and aggravating to fiddle around and have no resort other than a computer.On first impressions, I like the way it looks and feels in my hands, and especially the fact that it uses AA batteries. Unless there is no consumer choice in the matter, I'd never buy a camera that uses litheum batteries. The size of the LCD screen on the A1400 is the nearly identical to the A590, with maybe the new one being a tad brighter. Too much is made of the LCD screen. I have a friend whose camera has a dynamite LCD screen, the best I've seen to date, but the camera's actual pictures are so-so.I will get back later about how this camera performs, perhaps with a comparison to the older Canon.", "Date": "September 9, 2013"}, {"Title": "You Get What You Pay For", "Author": "Jennifer M. Coradi", "ReviewID": "RPHPWEUWA2KBL", "Overall": "2.0", "Content": "Having owned (and still owning) a number of Canon \"pocket\" type cameras (all the way back to the A700 and similar models), I expected this to be a decent pocket (literally, this time) shooter.  Sadly, I am not terribly happy with it, the only concession being it was at a giveaway price ($60).The only redeeming features (note I did not say \"qualities\") aside from the price are the optical viewfinder (yes, you can acually LOOK through the camera to set up a shot) and it's use of off-the-shelf batteries (AA).  Okay, the screen is a good size for a pocket cam, but that's about where it ends.Pictures are not great, but will do as long as you have plenty of light.  Make a note:  More megapixels DOES NOT necessarily mean higher quality photos!  Nothing is truer than with this camera.  I would take one of my old, clunky, \"low\" megapixel Canons over a dozen of this model any day.  But thats not as much an issue as USING this thing.Finding settings in the annoying on-screen menu takes forever, as opposed to past models with wheels or buttons for critical functions that you want to access and use quickly.  If you're under, say, 25 and don't mind an Xbox controller-like experience to get to the functions you want -- scrolling and selecting and all the other fun things that go along with navigating menus -- maybe you'll have a ball putting this to use.If you just want something to set on \"auto\" and shoot away with reckless abandon, or need something you can put at risk of getting broken, lost, or stolen, then pick one of these up as either a backup or just basic snapshots (beach vacations come to mind).  Beyond that, spend some more money and get something better.  Whether or not that's a Canon, I cannot say, as the only Canon I have gotten lately is an SLR which is fine.

What's even better, it's more than just a viewfinder: I can go into `live' mode and see exactly how the scene will be recorded instead of just on the digital display screen.PICTURE QUALITY is NOT the absolute best. Unless there is plenty of light, the pictures tend to be a little `noisy' with light artifacts showing up. If I was using this camera as a regular point & shoot I would be very annoyed. A regular Smartphone takes much clearer and better photos under these circumstances.BATTERY LIFE is good. The two AA batteries seem to last longer than in previous PowerShot versions and this is a big improvement. For instance, the A1100 uses batteries at twice the rate compared to this A1400. The newer versions of this camera (A2500) use a proprietary rechargeable battery but it's much easier for me to pack two spare AA batteries than buy and keep charged a spare A2500 proprietary rechargeable.FLASH RECOVERY TIME is pretty quick at about 1.5 seconds and has posed no problems for me. I don't expect the recovery time to be as fast as a full fledged DSLR, and the time really is acceptable.SIZE perfect for a small hand-held and it easily fits into a shirt pocket with room to spare and the weight is incredibly light.There are two BIG drawbacks to this camera:- First, the 300 page user manual is available on-line for download only. No printed copy is available unless you print it yourself. I cannot fathom why Canon would issue a manual this large and why they would not make a concise printed copy available.- All the shooting modes and selectable settings are not easily available or intuitive. For some reason Canon has done away with simple selections on a knob and buried them in the software where you have to scroll through menus and make multiple selections to find them. This is not good.Generally it really fits my needs for a very small, lightweight camera to document animal tracks and make short visual recordings of wildlife.

No, it's not something a National Geographic photographer would rely on full time, but it comes in very handy when dimensions and weight are important. Photos come out fine in the auto mode, although its functions can be easily customized for a variety of lighting situations. I particularly like the fact that it has a viewfinder since I'm most used to shooting that way. I also like that the display at the back can be turned off when using just the viewfinder. Don't know yet how much of a battery pirate it is; it takes 2 alkaline AA which are easy to install. Unfortunately, though, there is no battery level display, so keep a spare set close by. Supposedly, though, an on-screen icon or message indicates when barrereis are nearly depleted. Overall, the A1400 is pretty user-friendly. I probably will purchase a waterproof case for when I take it kayaking. One major complaint: Included instructions are woefully incomplete. I had to go to Canon's website to find a comprehensive manual, which I downloaded -- took a lot of time, ;ink and 123 sheets of paper. Bummer!!! At purchase I also was led to believe a USB cable was included. It was not. Amazon, however, sold me one and did not charge for shipping it. Owners also need to purchase a memory card. I got a Transcend 16GB SDHC Flash care and am pleased with it so far. I also bought a Case Logic DBC-302 soft case for added protection when the camera is not in use.

It was cheap and its quality reflected that.  Would have bought a more expensive one but optical viewers are scarce - and LCD are a joke if you are off your couch!!!!  But the big nag I have is that nowhere on the Alcatraz type packaging does it say that one needs a memory card.  When I drove back 50km and complained to the salesmen he said such little beauties have not come with cameras since 2009 - and I am meant to know that?  But in the specifications it gives memory cards but does not say one does not come in the box.  Having solved that problem I had to return AGAIN to the store because there was no USB cable in the box.  Admittedly it did say it had a USB port but other items nearly always come with what you need to use.  So why supply batteries which are obtainable virtually anywhere when memory & cables are not so easy to buy at ones local convenience store.  So the phrase \"use it out of the box\" can not be applied to his little glob of frustration. Next time I buy a Canon I will get the salesman to demonstrate it working before my very eyes. The camera (not Canon) I bought for my daughter had everything included.  By the way I would love to get another S200 - so Canon do you have any languishing in your back shelves in the stock room ??This added a little later!  I tried to get a \"USB\" cable.  The nearest Source people did not have one, the Japan Camera people did not have one.  So I returned to Walmart assuming that if they sold the A1400 to me they would have the cable - but NO.

Let me use my usual disclaimer, in the interest of fairness, and admit that I think many cameras by reputable makers (and there are many) deliver what they promise. It is more about what camera traits you are looking for. So, I would suggest to anyone looking to buy one to google 'camera trait search' and get the lay of the land.The A1400 is a fixed lens camera (point and shoot, some would say), with 16 resolution (megapixels), and a x5 zoom. The sensor size is 1/2.3 inch CCD-type, which is standard for cameras of its class.It has a viewfinder, which most in its class don't. The ISO rating, which is the gauge for how well it does in low light, is 1600. That rating is lower than many others, but it is sufficient for most purposes. The video is a Full HD- that is 1980x1080 resolution. It does not have a hot shoe for an external flash option. That is not unexpected for its size and category. The LCD screen is a 230,000 resolution. The camera does not do RAW processing but you would need only if you did not want to be limited by JPEG type storage. The weight of the camera is a convenient 135 grams.Overall, nice, fun camera. Having been into photography for a while, I do stress though that you do a camera trait search.

It can take pictures in many different situations.  The autofocus and autoexposure features are sophisticated and make snapshots easy.  It has a viewfinder: if you're shooting in bright daylight the viewfinder is a huge benefit.There are some things you can't do.  For instance you can't set the aperture size to adjust the depth of field.  And you can't set the shutter speed to adjust for whether the subject is moving.  Instead, Canon has given us some low-value features: super-vivid colors, poster-effect, fish-eye, miniature model, toy camera (vignetting), and monochrome.  These effects can be managed better by editing the pictures on a computer--that is, assuming you'd want them.Some of the advanced features require more dexterity than I have.  You have to hold the shutter button in the half-down position while you press some other button and then push the shutter button down the rest of the way while you're aiming the camera.  Also, you have to remember which button has which effect.  Or make a crib sheet to carry with you.  It makes me wonder if they field tested this thing.What's annoying is that it will stop taking pictures and notify you that the batteries are low when they still have a lot of charge in them.  I had the same problem with another Canon point-and-shoot so maybe it's just something about Canons.  So you need to carry a spare pair of batteries.  After the batteries have a few hours of rest they'll be good to go for a while.  When they just don't work anymore you can still use them in other gadgets till they really are used up.  Rechargeable batteries don't work because they don't charge up to the same voltage as alkaline batteries.It's handy because of its compactness.  You can carry it any time you're out and about: chances are you'll get an interesting picture or two.

Portraits, still life and macro pics are superb, crisp, and the colors are very vivid. The auto program is wonderful and seasoned photographers shouldn't shy away from it. The quality of pictures excel over my older sx130, but the zoom isn't nearly as good. Some were complaining of depth of field, although it won't be as deep as the pro cameras, it can be achieved somewhat in macro or portrait mode.

The telephoto produces good, crisp images. Learning how to obtain the correct focus took some patience. My needs are simple, so I haven't used all of the features available. I'm not sure how long the batteries will last. Perhaps I should carry a spare pair as a backup. Practice was required before I successfully discovered how to view recorded photos and to transfer them to my computer. The primary reason for purchasing this model was my frustration with the lack of a viewfinder on my Panasonic Lumix. The dials and buttons on the Lumix are more easily disturbed when carried in a pocket. The Lumix is also much heavier. The pictures obtained on both cameras are about the same in quality. I do like the rechargeable battery in the Lumix.", "Date": "September 25, 2013"}, {"Title": "great pics - bought it for my husband and he loves it.  We took it to Sweden and Norway and Iceland.
