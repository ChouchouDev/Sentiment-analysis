I bought it a week before thanksgiving when there's a discount, so the price is fairly good. Though it's not a professional camera, it's still a wonderful choice for non-pros to take nice pics, the color of these pics are pretty and the quality very good as well. I would suggest first learners to purchase this camera and it definitely won't disappoint you!I've carried this camera for a short trip to NY city and  taken several hundreds of pics. one suggestions is to get two memory cards and another battery for this camera. Then your trip will be definitely a recordable one :)", "Date": "December 23, 2013"}, {"Title": "Best little big thing ever!!", "Author": "Hb", "ReviewID": "R1XOOOHLQ4KAXM", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "Great on every level. Would recommend the viewfinder if you will be taking lots of sun outdoor shots.
