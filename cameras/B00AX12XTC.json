{"Reviews": [{"Title": "Why I 'jumped ship' from Canon PowerShot series to this Fujifilm S8200", "Author": "NLee the Engineer", "ReviewID": "R3TUC6A600IZEW", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I have been a loyal Canon shooter since the days of film SLRs over 20 years ago. In the past decade I have bought two Canon 'super zoom' cameras: the original PowerShot S1 in 2004 and the PowerShot S5 in 2008. Lately I'm itchy to get another super-zoom camera to replace the S5, because its 12x zoom no longer considered 'super' by today's standard. Naturally my first choice is another Canon PowerShot camera, either the PowerShot SX50 or the PowerShot SX500. After comparison, however, I decided to 'jump ship' and go with this Fujifilm FinePix S8200 instead. Here are my reasons why:- The Fujifilm S8200 is powered by four AA batteries. I prefer this design because I can use a set of Sanyo eneloop Pre-Charged Rechargeable Batteries in it, and keep another set as backup. In case of emergency, I can even use disposable alkaline batteries to power the camera. Early models in the Canon PowerShot Pro series (S1 to S10) were all powered by AA batteries. But latest models are using proprietary lithium-ion rechargeable battery packs. That means I have to buy another battery pack as backup, and also need to bring yet another dedicated battery charger for my trips.- The Canon SX500 (which is priced similarly) has a big disadvantage in that it is missing the EVF (electronic view finder). Using EVF on the S8200 makes it easier to shoot under bright sunlight, and it helps to hold the camera steady when shooting at super zoom.- The Canon SX50 has an EVF and offers a longer zoom range (50X vs. 40x). But it is also priced 50% more than the Fujifilm S8200.After playing with the S8200 for a few days, I'm very happy with my choice. For shooting under daylight, the image quality is good enough for most situations. Of course, the image quality at low-light cannot compare to that of a digital SLR camera, such as my Canon EOS Rebel T1i. This is to be expected given the tiny image sensor used in a camera this size (It's the law of physics: smaller sensor pixel area means worse signal-to-noise ratio). For low-light situation, I prefer to fix the ISO at 1600, and save in 'Small' (4MP) image size.Some other observations:- The zoom lens of the S8200 is physically much longer than that of the S5. See the pictures I uploaded to 'Customer Images' section for size comparison.- The S8200's lens makes louder noise than the S5 while zooming (the latter advertises \"UltraSonic\" on the lens)- The focusing is NOT maintained while zooming. This is the same problem I have with S5. In contrast, my Canon EF-S 17-85mm Image Stabilized USM SLR Lens does maintain focusing while zooming, but that lens is 2x the price of this camera.- The image stabilization mechanism works quite well. Note that both Canon and Fujifilm cameras use optical image stabilization which works equally well across zoom range. Other cameras (such as the Olympus SP-800UZ) that use 'sensor-shift' mechanism do not work well at high zoom.I have no problems migrating from my old Canon S5 to the new Fujifilm S8200. Most of the controls are either identical, or very simple to figure out. Basically I just pick up the new camera, set it to 'P' (programmed auto) and started shooting. On the other hand, there are still a lot of new features on the S8200 that I have yet to take advantage of. For examples:- Rapid shot of 10 frames in one second- Automatically capture 360-degree panorama- Shoot video in high-speed to playback in slow-motion, and so on.So maybe one of these days, I'll actually get around to reading the user manual...", "Date": "July 7, 2013"}, {"Title": "Awesome features!", "Author": "Karen Ford", "ReviewID": "R2DDLEH4AH0GU4", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "This is my third Fuji camera, and I love the brand.  This particular camera is loaded with lots of features, from special filters to a 40xzoom.  And as always, Fuji cameras are user friendly.  I especially love the double zoom switch, one on top of the camera and a rocker style switch on the lens barrel, so you can use it right or left handed.  The picture quality is awesome, and the menu is easy to navigate.  I'm an advanced amatuer photographer, having over 40 years of experience with film and digital, and I have to say this is one of my favorite cameras.", "Date": "May 10, 2013"}, {"Title": "Fuji S8200 and the Nikon P520", "Author": "D. Baxley", "ReviewID": "R3MANKHUWBWD5T", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "July 31, 2013I am trying out a Fuji 8200 and a Nikon p520 -- the Nikon's nearest competitor would be the Canon SX50 and both of these cameras are twice the money of the Fuji S8200 -- And guess what?  I think the Fuji S8200 can compete right along of them.  I am not a pro, far from it, but I am a consumer, sometime beach visitor, family reunion, grandpa, etc. kind of guy using a camera for the occasional sunset and kids running around -- yeah, close up facials too.  Anyway, in the hands of a novice like me the Fuji is the big winner.  I know, I know, the true camera buffs will be throwing fruit at me, but it is the real world I live in and I do not have the fancy equipment to test these thing, only my own physical attributes, as weak as they are, help me make the choices I make.  Look at it like this - how many times have you research, and research then bought the recommended product with Consumers Report's stamp of approval only to have the very same 5 star product fail you?  Never?  Then you are not a true consumer.  The rest of you know of what I speak.  Okay, so here are my reasons and my findings, minus the expert opinion - and often it is just an opinion.The Bad (cons) first:The Video Zoom can be tricky.  The image will break up as it tries to keep up with you moving (me) the camera wildly around form one subject or animal to another.  Stable shooting, leaning on top of a post, or car hood (how has time to set up a clunky tripod?  The images once stable are great.  Also, the zoom motor is recorded - definitely do not like that, it is noisy and hard to ignore.  Solution - do your zooming before you record.  I know it is fun to zoom in and out, but save your batteries.  Guess what?  The Nikon zoom is a wonder.  It is quiet as can be and will not appear on the sound track of your videos.  It also seems to handle the fast movements and focusing better.  My next biggest gripe for the Fuji is the tiny viewfinder, not as big a dime, and the image is so hard to frame and you feel like you are guessing a lot, but the pics once upload look great - update, after 3 days:  Later this announce dissipated as I became more accustomed to the viewing images through it and framing the shot I wanted, still, couldn't it be a little bigger?  The Nikon P520 and the Canon SX50 the same is true -- tiny viewfinders and I found the Nikon the most irritating for some reason and it made the Fuji seem better, but I have no reason why, they seem to be the same size.  Images coming out of the Nikon were crisp (sharp) but the colors seemed washed out a bit, the greens not so green and dry grasses (shooting some Elk in a Field) nearly invisible or faded out.  The Fuji seemed to burst with color, you could see the individual strands of grass and the various shades of green just popped off the screen of my Laptop.  I tried different settings but a pro would have to explain this to me, I could not see the reason why the much more expensive Nikon appeared to be weaker in this area - after all, it is the pictures we are after, right.  Perhaps, on some kind of photo analyzer the Nikon would prove to be the more accurate photo but when you put the two, same shots, together, under the exact same conditions of the exact same Elk - well, what can I say, the Fuji S8200 creamed the Nikon in my eyes.  The Fuji seemed easier to navigate the outer buttons and menu control, being slightly larger on the Fuji, except for the record button -- the placement is fine on the Fuji and I have gotten used to it,  but I found myself searching for it in my mad panic to get something on video -- the Nikon, however, has the record button is in a sweet spot and easy on easy off in such a natural position you have to love it.  The Fuji is a bit bigger than the Nikon and this would explain the somewhat larger control buttons. The sx50 Cannon falls somewhere in between, for size.  I have never used the canon, only played with it at the display table.The on-off switch of the Fuji is a simple pull (slide) button, easy to find and use.  The Nikon has a sunken push button that might give you problems is you are wearing gloves, but it has a neat feature, when it is on and LED light that lights up around the button so you can see if it is on or off.In the beginning I honestly tried to keep talking myself into the Nikon because of all the positives the pro photo picture takers give it.  After all, more money means better, tight?  Plus, I do like the compact, smaller feeling of the Nikon. But in practical, side by side use, by a grandpa novice the Fuji wins and I find myself grabbing for the Fuji first.From What I can See:Fuji S8200 - faster start up, really quick compared to the Nikon\\Zoom seem fasterShoots just as good in low light --Shoot HDR - for improved picture definition --Shoots 3D pictures -The camera bag with the Nikon is practically useless - maybe just for storing the cameraThe camera bag that comes with the Fuji is practical and useful - the camera can be carried in a ready to retrieve and shoot, it has a good cover flap with Velcro fastener for quick closure and retrieval, also enough storage for extra batteries and SD cards.  I guess the Nikon, in being smaller, they were thinking smaller?I found the design excellent and after a couple of days of shooting on the beach and off the pier at New, Port Oregon, I am falling in love with this camera - Fuji S8200, that is.  It has the coolest Panoramic feature that I have never seen before.  First the Panoramic setting is right on top of the camera on the selector wheel, just click and shoot.  Set the selector on Panoramic and press the snap button and release and begin panning around in a circle - it does it automatically.  You can do a 120 degree shot or a 180, or 360, very nice.Pricing:  Either the Nikon and Canon are way over priced or there is something terribly wrong with the Fuji and I just have not found it yet -- maybe the lens will fall out after a 1000 pictures?  Maybe, however, it is the Fuji that is fairly priced and it is Nikon and Canon that are trying to --- make money?  Fine, I'm not against making money, but one camera is $230 and the other two are $400 plus?Battery Powered:  The Fuji uses AA batteries as its power source and if you spend $9 at Bi-Mart, or Wal-Mart you can get a charger and four Nimh batteries that the manual says will shoot 500 pics -- every bit as good as the Nikon Lithium-ion battery pack -- but if you spent the extra dough and get a charge with the Lithium recharge batters the manual says it jumps to 700 pics which beats both the Nikon and the Canon in power savings.  UPDATE:  I bought a RayOvac NiMh recharge kit, came with four batteries too, for the $9 I had mentioned before.  After trying them out, well, the low battery light keeps coming on after a few shots, but I have ignored this for the past couple of days shooting.  It seems the after a few shots and some video the batter low signal comes on.  I shut the camera off and a few minutes later it seems to recover and I continue shooting.  Two days not and I am on the same batteries, and I have shot at least 200 pictures and 6 or more videos and zoom, zoom, zoom - the low battery light still comes on after a few shot but keeps recovering.  I think it may be due to the capacity of these cheap batteries may be lower than what is actually required.  But, they are working.  I am scouting out Amazon and have found some Lithium Batteries and Charger I will order with at least 2800 mh - Amazon, here I come again, no shipping charges, you have to love it.  I think the NiMh I have may only be 1,100 or 1,400 mh and look as I might I cannot find anywhere on these RayoVacs the mh levels - some kind of trade secret, I guess, or they are just embarrassed to say - but, after two days of low battery warnings I am still taking pictures.The Manual: The manual that come with this Fuji is excellent.  The Starter mini manual is definitely a Quick Starter - the real manual is on the disk and is about 130 pages.  It is loaded with info about this camera and its features.  Funny thing, about the Software, another reviewer said they did not like the fact you had to use their software to access you images?  This was coming from someone passing themselves off as semi-pro photographer, too?  This is not true at all, and I think most of us having used or not used the manufactures software know this.  The Images can be load straight from the SD card to your PC or Laptop and you can use any photo software you want.  You are not restricted as the other review suggested.  I have owned 6 digital cameras and have not like the photo software that came with any of them.  In fact I hardly ever use any of the photo software at all.  Film correcting, for me, takes place on the spot, retouching is old hat and most cameras, like this Fuji will do on the spot editing, even cropping and red eye.  If you want more then go for the DSLR type of camera.  I hear the Nikons are really good - I did try out the Nikon P3000, but I wanted more lens ($200+) and a macro lens, and a bag of filters and --- well, you get the idea.  I have all of this in the Fuji as does the Nikon and Canon SX50.After several days of use:The Fuji S8200 has a neat feature - located on top of the camera is a round, selector dial, and on this dial is something called the SRAuto, also where the Panoramic selection is on the same dial.  The SRauto setting selects the shooting situation for you - do not confuse this with Auto, which is good for us novices, too, but this setting goes a step further and actually moves to the setting for the condition you are shooting automatically.  For example, a bee lands on a flower and you hustle to get set up in Macro for a close up - bee flies off - with a DSLR you have to crack out another lens - with the Nikon and Canon you have to find the Macro setting - with the Fuji you just zoom in or move in and take the picture.  With the SRAuto set, you are automatically set into the macro mode just by going for the shot, incredible - not absolutely perfect, but close and more often than not.  Does it work?  You bet it works.  How do they do it?  Beats me, but it does work.  You are taking pictures of flowers and you look up and realize how beautiful the mountains are, you point the camera at the mountains and it automatically reset to the settings for shooting distant mountains.This camera also has a \"Features select\" call the Adv setting on the selector wheel, and from this setting you can go crazy.  Super Low Light shooting, 3D pictures and a whole range of other types of shots.I have only begun to explore what this camera will do.  If, however, you want to be the total master over your domain (God's creation, really), and you thirst for full creative license, then go buy a Nikon 7000, for over a $1,200 (on Sale), or maybe a Nikon 5100, then buy some expensive lenses to switch in and out for the particular purpose you are looking for.  I would advise the pro photographer to get one of these cameras to shoot pictures with while their assistant is setting up their Pro camera for that once in a life time shot.  Oh, look, a butterfly, look at that bird and those clouds, and that lizard on a rock - hey, assistant, have you finished setting me up yet?As for me, grandpa shooting snotty nosed little grand kids, the occasional sunset, and playing like the pro photographer and getting some really great shots, this camera might be the one for you it is turning out fine for me.  I have set the Nikon aside and will return it, as per the return policy Cost Co offers, with no hard feeling - I bought the Fuji at Cost Co also and see the price at Amazon to be compatible with them.  If, however, you want the Nikon then by all means, buy from Amazon and save nearly $80.I promise to update this review if the Lens falls out, or some other event, proving you pay for what you get.  So far this Fuji S8200 is proving to be a reliable and well built camera with fantastic features and abilities beyond the norm.  Love it.  Okay, Fuji, where is my check?  Only kidding, I really am a retired retail clerk and grandpa with real world experience.UPDATE - 09/10/2013:  After taking many hundreds of wedding pictures -- we traveled to Bend Oregon to attend two weddings.  This camera preformed as expected -- great.  Still, while the view finder was a life saver in the bright, high desert sun, if you know Bend in the summer, the view finder was a real pain.  Really small and hard to see through.  I felt like I was guessing a lot but it did help get me on the shot I wanted but I could not tell if it was going to be a great shot, a clear shot, until I could review it later.  This has become such and issue with me, because I wear glasses, that I coughed real hard and upgraded to a Canon Rebel T3i, which I love -- then I better love it at twice the price of the Fuji.  The Zoom of the Fuji was so great I had to then buy another lens for the Canon so I could enjoy the same kind of power.  It helped that I found this Canon marked down, for some reason.  Wal-Mart apparently did not want to carry this camera anymore and marked it down to $450, which is strange, as my home store Wal-Mart still sells this camera for $699.  This Canon came with the 18-55mm lens and works great and is about equal to a 3-4x zoom.  I went on line and found the 75-300mm canon lens for $100 and just got it the other day, and love it.  I have nothing bad to say about the Canon Rebel T3i -- the view finder is marvelous (think Billy Crystal), just marvelous my dear.  What a nice camera, pretty easy to use and under stand.  Still, the Fuji was only $240, and believe me, it is a lot of camera for the money and the pictures?  Well, I have everyone from the weddings requesting copies and I see some of them showing up online -- everyone was taking pictures, mostly with phone cams.  I only wish I had had this Canon then.

So, I purchased the Fujifilm Finepix S8200 and did side by side (picture/picture and video by video) comparisons.I think you should know I wanted the Fujifilm to win, it's just so much more fun to use....it has a programmable mode dial, fast picture shooting is a little quicker than the Nikon's, easier to do 360 images, view finder (although a little cheap) is a nice plus, 40x zoom, feels better in your hand etc..Image, Video- The Nikon was the clear winner for image and video quality no matter what the ISO/light, by leaps, pictures are clear, video quality and frame rate are excellent and on par with a dedicated video cam.  In both comparisons the Fujifilm had more noise and colors were either washed out or too dark (I tried adjusting the settings and the gains were minimal).Audio - Nikon wins.  The audio from the Nikon is clear and audio capture/output is on par with a video cam.Low light (no flash) - In low light there was no comparison, the Nikon's ability to brighten and color with significantly less noise than the Fujifilm is borderline amazing.  I took a photo of my dog at the entrance of our apartment at night with only ambient light behind me, the Nikon produced detail I couldn't see with the naked eye and Fujifilm could even render the my dog.Low Light (w flash) - The Nikon wins.  Pictures are quick to take, the Flash is accurate, colors are rich.  The Fujifilm does a good job but when compared to the Nikon, the images look washed out and grainy.Image Stabilization - Nikon wins.  Both set to 30x zoom and the Nikon made taking photos a breeze while the Fujifilm required significantly more concentration for a steady hand.30x Zoom v 40x Zoom - This is deceptive because one would think at full zoom you would see more detail from the Fujifilm, not the case.  When both cameras were set to 30x zoom, the Nikon was the clear winner, it's shots are significantly clearer with better colors.  I did a 40x and 30x zoom comparison whereby I increased the Nikon's captured image to match the scale of the Fujifilm's captured image at 40x.  Results: Fujifilm's 40x could not better Nikon's 30x for detail...big surprise.SD write speed - Both are fast in good light.  In low light the Fuji is a little quicker but the image capture is not the same quality.Battery Life - Both have excellent battery life. For the Nikon, I finally ran out of juice after 400 or so images and 12 mins of video.Bottom line Nikon Coolpix L820 - The Nikon is just a very good camera in all respects and excellent value.Bottom Line Fujifilm FP S8200 - The Fujifilm S8200 is OK.  It came close to matching the Nikon's image quality when outdoors in bright conditions.  Ultimately, you get a little more than what you pay for.I'm glad I compared the two and now totally OK with not having a view finder. ; )", "Date": "September 11, 2013"}, {"Title": "s8500 camera", "Author": "Paul Oman", "ReviewID": "R2O6QDI4XZYXO4", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "This camera replaces an old finePix s5100 I've had and enjoyed for years. I am very happy with this new camera. It feels good and appears to be as well built as my s5100 which had a 10x zoom.A bit disappointed in the 46X zoom, which was a main reason for the purchase. Zooms are pretty cool up to about 10 or 15X but then the image only seems to 'enlarge' a small amount for all that extra zoom. But is nice is the other end, without the zoom (equals a 24mm lens) which is sort of wide angle. I like that!There are 10 shooting modes with different options in each. The most simple is a easy point and shoot mode.There are 2 zoom buttons. You can set one to work faster or slower than the primary zoom. It is nice to slowly zoom in.What help convince to buy another finepix camera is that they use 4 AA batteries - easy and cheap to find and buy and carry a spare set. No need to recharge some funny battery that probably will not recharge in a few years - or might not even be available. Also I like looking through a view finder rather than a screen. Maybe I'm just old, or my vision isn't that good, but having both options is a must have.For me the $300 cost was a lot of money, but I see similar cameras selling for $600 or $800 and I don;t really see what all that extra money buys - maybe just a classic camera brand name.After setting all my personal options etc. I found pictures turn out to be about 7.5 megs and that my 32g memory card can take about 2000-2500 pictures.

Every camera I have owned had its strengths, its weaknesses, and its places that improve with a learning curve. The FinePix S8200 is no exception.The fast menu displays and easily pushed navigation are sure to be assets once I figure out the basic layout of my new camera. But for now, I am lost. I cannot read and understand what is going on before the screen changes. Here are my other pros and cons:Pros:* I got some nice shots with good color and detail!* The bigger size is not as awkward / heavy as I was afraid it would be.* You can leave the lens-cap on when you are not taking pictures. (to review / set the menus)* No bright/blinding autofocus light. With my previous cameras, a bright autofocus light made it hard to sneak pictures of kids and pets just being themselves. And family members with sensitive eyes would complain, even if I turned off the flash.Cons:* Lighting - Pictures taken in low light come out much darker than I expected. Pictures taken in bright light are more washed out than expected. And the sunset picture I took ... I have no idea how the sky showed so dark!* Focus - Pictures taken indoors with auto and party setting did not come out as clear as I expected. Hopefully this will get better as I learn to work with the camera.* Colors - Regular shots do not have as much contrast as I am used to. The pop color doesn't look right. And the partial color under advanced filters is buggy. I took a picture set to show red of my daughter holding a large red heart. EVERYTHING showed up gray. Took another picture of some pink liquid (still set on red) and about half of it showed as pink/red. Took another (yellow) of my daughter in karate class. Her yellow hair tie and yellow belt were highlighted, but so was a portion of her brown hair.* Doesn't have all the fun/easily accessible features as I am used to.* I don't like the 1080 interlaced video. I prefer 1080p for crisper views when I click pause. Works fine at 720p.Overall, I still give this camera a 4-star rating. I think it will be excellent when used in the right conditions.

This camera is great if you are taking pictures outside or in medium to high light.The camera lacks good quality low light abilities. The camera fails at low light tests. The pictures have so much noise in them that even using professional programs in Photoshop (like noise ninja) don't help that much. The ISO needed to be turned down to 100 to even get a fair picture inside (the camera should only have to be set to 800-1600 to take a good low light picture). And if you turn the ISO down to 100 then your going to need a tripod to stay sill for 1.5 sec or your picture will become blurry. It is impossible to hold the camera still for that long with out a tripod. I have a $100 Sony point to shoot that takes better pictures inside then this camera. This camera looks like someone took the picture with a smartphone when in low light..... The build quality is great and the viewfinder is not 1/2 bad. The screen is also not that bad, but you should really only use the view finder so that you can save some battery.I would recommend this camera as still the best Bridge SLR out there for under $300. But if you can save up some cash, I would recommend the SONY DSC-HX200VB, or another high end Bridge SLR.--------------------------Update 8/12/13I gave the camera one more star (4/5)After using it some more, I compared the pictures to other bridge SLRs in this price range and found that it was one of the best IN ITS PRICE RANGE. I would still recommend getting a higher end Bridge SLR or even a normal SLR if you can afford it. But if you don't want to spend more then $300 then this is the camera for you.

There are 3 versions of this model; s8500 (Europe), s8200 (USA) and s8300 (the rest of the world??) with minor differences in zoom power. The camera feels very good in both hands, it is ergonomic, for super sharp pictures (maximum pixels) above X20 one needs a tripod or a 'bean bag' but there seems to be image stabilization in lesser pixel modes (sporting events) so that action shots are sharp. The macro feature is fantastic and the camera comes with several \"artistic\" modes [soft focus, vignette, diorama, etc.].

This camera is great for an Amateur photographer. This would not be for a experienced photographer. If this purchase is for a family camera anyone can use this camera. A more advanced shooter than an aim and shoot to using manual settings for a more advance Aim and shoot features. You must read the manual play with the settings to take pictures to get to know this camera. The way you change your ISO settings in the camera for a particular shot does take great pictures. My husband does not get into picture taking and I can set it to the automatic setting for him and he can take great pictures with it. I am more advanced than Aim and shoot photographer for enjoying leisure photos of places I go. Love this camera for the size and not bulky  or heavy. Fits in small hands well. The best part I love is have great zoom capabilities and no camera lenses to lug around. This camera has a setting that you set for the 3 different types of batteries you can use in this camera. You can use an expensive photo battery, 4 Lithium batteries or 4 Alkaline batteries in this camera. I found the most affordable and easy accessible batteries and last a long time is Energizer Ultimate Lithium batteries in this camera. When set the type of battery you have in the camera makes the camera have excellent battery life. Most cameras I have seen don't have that feature and battery usage is a very important feature in a camera. That is why I chose this camera over Cannon was the battery life reviews. This camera has excellent reviews on battery life. I am very pleased with this camera and have no regrets with this purchase. To get the best quality pictures with this camera you must take pictures play with the camera to learn all that it can do. You will not be happy if you just use the basic features to get the best potential and great snapshots with this camera. It took me a few times out to find a great setting for exposure, shutter settings etc. in the camera for my own liking. Make sure you play with the camera and you will be an excellent picture taker and pleased with this camera and what it can do in a compact camera all in one. Make sure you fill out the registration card with Fugi for excellent warranty experience. And lastly this camera does not have WiFi uploading to facebook technology. Which actually you can do just as well uploading to your special website using the USB card reader for easy transfer of photos to save them to your special hard drive or special online storage of your photos. Why do you need a special camera to do Wifi when most people have cell phones to do that? Better security when you have more control how you upload your photos. I would rather spent less money for a camera that takes great photos than paying for a feature to do Wifi technology. Simpler the better for a camera that takes great pictures. One thing with this camera it would not be good for the beach getting sand in it. Highly recommend getting a small affordable water camera for the beach snapshots.", "Date": "November 14, 2013"}, {"Title": "Best camera ever!", "Author": "Thomas Shumadine", "ReviewID": "ROV9PV09FRN4J", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I have had 3 other ultra zoom digital cameras and this is by far the best.

I really like the long zoom and the pictures are really nice as well.  This is not an SLR but it also doesn't have an SLR+equivalent lens price.  However, that does not mean it doesn't take nice pictures.

its just my opinion)- and a neck strap (this one is actually very sturdy)EXTERIOR:Ok let start this review saying that this camera feels, weight as much, and looks like a DSLR even my friends tryed to remove the lenses once, so Funny:), its built quality  is good, it feels really good in your hand, it has leather covers to rest your fingers of your right hand, and the plastic band around the lens is used to be rested on your left hand (for long range-zoom shots) please note that the band has no useful purpose other than stetic or to give a better camera grip, (is not a manual zoom or anything like that)BUTTONS:Very well thought buttons, they are so easy to remember even when looking inside the EVF (Electronic view finder) i configured the right zoom button to be fast and the left side lever on the lens to be a slow steady zooming button.the FN button or up button of the camera is a custom button it comes customized as an ISO button, and i left it that way.there are 3 buttons that are specifically designed for: 1 rapid shot modes, 2 white  balance, and 3 camera recording (this last one let you record in almost every mode your have selected using your preferences, and you can still take some photos)and finally theres a flash pop up button used for logic reasonsAll other buttons are standard on almost all cameras so i wont make you lose time reading about them.INTERFACE:If you have used a sony camera the menus will look ugly, you can select some colors, i went with black, but they are still usefull so i dont mind you can scroll using the analog buttons and a scrolling ring.SCREEN AND EFV:Not really the strong side of the camera, the colors look ok and the resolution is decent, the LCD has a sun mode to increase brightness but it is still limited, that is when the EVF comes to live and you notice it has a very low resolution but still good to take some good shoots, (remember to calibrate it before use otherwise you will see everything blurry) and this is ponit in favor to this camera for the price few bridge camera feature a EVF.ZOOM:this is the strongest side of the camera along with its features, almost no loss in quality but with less contrast and bright in the pictures when using it at maximun, the zoom is nice and good, its like using mi old telescope but clearer and with a more steadier movement (thanks to the camera systems) but still, it is highly recomended to use a tripod for max zoom shots.PICTURE QUALITY:Its Decent-good ive seen better and worse its like a canon sx 510h 12mp picture enlarged to 16mp but with less contranst (the two cameras use the same sensor size), super macros (1cm) are unique and impressive, long range pictures are good, wide angle pictures are good at ISO 100  and in fine settings, try to never use ISO above 3200, you have been warned.there is no RAW format to be selected keep that in mind. fine format uses about 7mb each picture, and normal format jpeg uses 5mb each picture. if you want some example pics or a more in deep review go here: [...]in my personal use i have purchased the camera with a HCSD class 10 of 32GB that gives you around 4000 pics in fine setting or 7000 pics in normal settings in 16mp and 2 rounds of eneloop batteries (4 batteries each) that will last you 600 pics each.VIDEO QUALITY: (IMPORTANT IT IS GOOD)there are so many reviews that have negative scores about this feature just for the zoom noise, there was a mayor point in favor (1080p\\60fps) and in con (noisy zoom when recording video)in my experience with this camera i can tell you this 3 things that will help you a lot in videos: 1.- The video quality and speed is awesome the stereo sound is good, 2.- if you dont want to hear the zoom, just change the settings from optical to digital zoom and it IS SOLVED (IT IS THAT EASY), and 3.- important you can only film in full HD clips of max 30 minutes it doesnt matter your memory card capacity.and lets not even mention the high speed video at 320p look terrible but still a feature to be playing with.FEATURES3d shots .- you are supposed to take 2 pictures of the same object in different positions, it can only view them on 3d certified devices (not this camera) i ve never tried it so no comments hereburst mode.- up to 10 fps in 16mp and only 3 in max quality settings, and 30fps or more in 3mp.auto advanced mode.- automatically select the best scene in 6 modes, kinda usefull for macros and portrait.some filters: toy camera, and othersMY FINAL CONCLUSION:this camera is a steal if you compare the price i got mine on amazon for about 185 USD, even the canon sx510h or nikon have a better image quality (a friend of mine have one) but does not come so well feature packed as this one for the price. best features: zoom and price (for the price everything looks good)so i recomend it****\u00b0 4,5 stars :)hope to help you! i will update if i experience any problem with the camera, 1st month, so far working fine, i will test it on an trip to galapagos islands.Some Tips:Buy this camera with:- A tripod (i got the pedco ultrapod 2 with velcro)- 2 kits of 4 AA rechargable batteries (i got eneloop with charger)- a 32 gb SD Class 10 (i got trascend for the price)- and a case for all, i got a case logic compact system/hybrid camera case, and believe it or not it is smaller than i thougth and still i can carry all the accesories i had mentioned before, 8 AA batteries, charger, tripod, camera, with no problems but there is no space for more items and the tripod legs are outside the case but i can live with that :)and i am sorry for my english i am not from an english speaking country so i tried my best to give some information to you.", "Date": "May 6, 2014"}, {"Title": "Simply Terrific!!!", "Author": "Grandpa", "ReviewID": "R2VUWDTO2YZP3C", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I decided it was time for a new camera.  I had three fundamental requirements going in:  1) viewfinder, 2) AA batteries, and 3) long zoom.  I spent quite a bit of time reading reviews, contemplating, and comparing cameras.  When it came down to it, there was no other option.  The Fujifilm S8400W  was the camera for me.  So, I ordered it.  My old camera is a viewfinder Fujifilm with AA batteries and I had a great experience with it, so I was comfortable with the decision.The camera came today, and my wife and I spent two hours taking photos around the neighborhood.  I'm in awe.  I was able to take handheld photos at full zoom with no visible shake.  I timed the camera from off to \"ready to take that shot\".  It was fast ... more than fast enough for me at less than two seconds.  I tried a wide variety of settings and options.  It was easy to change settings.  I took about 300 shots, including some full-HD videos, and my rechargeable AA batteries were still going strong.Although I prefer a viewfinder, my wife prefers using the LCD screen.  She was pleased that it was bright enough to be useful in the bright Florida sun, unlike her old camera's display.  She found the camera easy to use and is pleased as well.I then spent some time playing with my Android tablet.  Accessing photos on the camera from my tablet via WiFi using Fujifilm's Android Apps very simple.  Very simple and very logical.  Intuitive even.  That will be a real asset when we are on travel, as a 10\" tablet screen is much better than the camera's  3\" display for reviewing the day's photos.Setting up the application for wireless backup on my PC was not nearly as easy.  I blame the directions provided by Fujifilm  rather than the software itself.  After I finally figured out what Fujifilm was trying to say, it wasn't all that difficult to set up, and works flawlessly.Bottom line:  This is simply a terrific camera.  It takes great shots, is very flexible, and the image stabilization works extremely well.  The camera is solidly built, perhaps even better than my old Fujifilm that I was so happy with.There is a firmware upgrade available at the  Fujifilm website that I will be installing tomorrow.  It is supposed to make image stabilization even better.Two week update:  I love the camera.  We took quite a few photos of nesting birds with it from a boat and many of the shots  were at full zoom. I'm still amazed I can do that, hand held, and get well-focused pictures.  Also, I updated the firmware; it was quite easy to do and Fujifilm's directions were very clear.I have had some problems using the \"PC Autosave\" cabability, which transfers photos from the camera to your PC (in my case, Windows 8.1) using WiFi.  It ultimately works, but have had a few sniggling problems that I have contacted Fujifilm about.  I suspect it's a Windows 8.1 problem.", "Date": "March 20, 2014"}, {"Title": "Fujifilm FinePix S8200", "Author": "C. Parks", "ReviewID": "RZZOIWET5B6RZ", "Overall": "2.0", "Content": "First Review - TWO STARs....I purchased this camera for a few main reasons; I've had Fuji FinePix cameras for many years and liked them all; many cameras have good reputations but not many have viewfinders; an electronic view finder/LCD screen setup is an absolute must for me; I am familiar with how Fuji FinePixs  operate ( I don't care much for change, probably an age thing) .Ist observations out of the box:  It appears to be well made, as are the other FinePixs I have had. At set-up it is very noticeable that it is a much heavier camera than the two most recent Fujis I have owned. According to my (old) Acculab gram scale the S5000 weighs 478 grams (1 lb. 0.8 ounces) and the 3800 is only 412 grams (14.5 ounces), whereas the S8200 comes in at 705 grams (1 lb. 8.8 ounces)! All the weighing was done with carrying straps attached as well as batteries and memory card inserted.2nd - The zoom is very LOUD! It scared off the birds I tried focus in on to photograph! Oh no! This is not good - definitely not acceptable!3rd - Though the LCD screen is viewable, nothing is recognizable when sighting through the EVF.  It is like looking through a fog-bank. Bummer!! Guessing on what the subject is, isn't acceptable either!Because of this request in the information packet: PLEASe DO NOT RETURN THIS PRODUCT TO YOUR PLACE OF PURCHASE BEFORE CONTACTING FUJIFILM, I have not yet returned it. I will reserve final thoughts on this product for now. Tomorrow I will talk to them and will add to the review or adjust the rating.UPDATE 12/11/13: Contacted Fuji today and the very nice man told me he was, \"Sorry about the product. There is nothing I can do for you\", which is what I expected.

My wife started taking my Lumix point and shoot  away from me on trips. When we realized she had a great eye and needed a better camera of her own, we did some research and came up with this little number. The Finepix S8300  is what they call a Bridge Camera. Its a Point and shoot with the soul of a DSLR. It has an incredible zoom, great lens sharpness, fantastic extra features like black and white with one selective color (red, green blue, yellow purple and orange) panorama and 3D! Shoots great HD video and up to 480 frames per second for great super slo mo video - although at that rate there is no audio and it is at 320x120 resolution. It is light, takes AA batteries (which I would buy rechargeables if I were you),but its good for up to 500 shots on one charge. The f stop range is only 2.9 to 6.5 which is a little limited, but is ok for hobbyists - if you are a pro you would be looking to spend more than the >$225 area anyway. Tons of features for such a small cam and low price. I used Snapsort.com to compare this to other Fuji and SONY, Nikon and Cannon. Although the popularity and fixed lens brought its score down, for the price, extra features, focal length and video formats its clear that the Fuji would be the best choice for me. There are a few differences in the finepix S8000 series cameras, and a bigger difference between their other S#### cams.

This camera is no exception. It has a ton of added features, including Wifi. One of the setting I like is to put the camera in P mode and use the Auto(xxxx) setting where xxx is 400,800,1600,3200. Doing this limits the top end ISO setting it will use. It is nice if you want to force it to use a lower ISO while not limiting you, if the camera thinks it can go lower. The pictures in general were good but anything above ISO400 showed some some noise, which was a bit disappointing(this is where the Auto(400) comes in handy). The focusing was ok, but it did have some issues at times, when zoomed in.The Wifi worked well and it handled Wifi Access points properly(unlike the Canon SX510). The one issue I had tho was using the phone app to browse stuff on the camera. Every time I tried to use this mode, it wouldn't connect. Otherwise it was great.The main issue I had was recording movies. If you didn't zoom, they came out fine, although you had to be careful to let it refocus at times. The sound was weak tho. I felt like it should be picking up more sound than it was. The real issue was when you used the zoom while recording. I got a serious motor noise that was loud enough to completely overrun any normal audio I happened to be recording. I saw a few people mention this, but I'm surprised more haven't, as it is extremely annoying and really puts a damper on recording movies.I really wanted to like this thing but the motor noise/weak sound on movies(which I use on occasion) and added noise at the higher ISOs I think is just too much for me.", "Date": "February 18, 2014"}, {"Title": "Great for wanna be professionals", "Author": "DavidA", "ReviewID": "RNYAVS4UIWFBW", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "With a 42x zoom lens and other options, this is a great product for people serious about their photography.

Let's start with the fact that I am no longer in my teens or twenties (far from it!). I was accustomed to using my 35mm Canon when the digital age hit the marketplace. I started using the point-and-shoot digital cameras that I could put in my purse or pocket. In the course of a few years I moved from a Kodak, to a Nikon, to a Canon digital, each getting a little better picture for me. I could carry them in my pocket but my pictures just weren't as clear or good as I had hoped. I've wanted to go DSLR, but those cameras were WAY out of my price range, so I did the best I could with my little digitals. A few months ago, my husband heard me say that my nephew was getting better pictures on his cell phone than I was getting with my cameras.That began our search for a good camera that was reasonably priced. My research led me to the Fujifilm cameras. I was thinking of the S4200, (largely due to a price-quality comparison) but when we went shopping, my husband, knowing my love of photography, kept moving me up the line to the s8200. It was almost double what I had wanted to pay, but the camea was impressive. Once I made up my mind, the stores where we were shopping were out of the s8200s. Amazon came to the rescue.So .... what do I like? The camera is smarter than I am. Its point-and-shoot settings let me take good-to-great pictures while I am learning to use the many settings & features as I go along.I used to do some professional photography when I was younger, so this camera \"feels\" like a camera. It has a 3-inch LCD monitor & an electronic viewfinder that I can use to stop the glare that makes it almost impossible to frame my pictures in the older digital cameras. This is not a little rectangular box; this is a camera. There is a comfortable handgrip I can use to balance my pictures. Its image stabilization feature is helpful. My hands aren't as steady as they used to be. The 8200 tries hard to give me the best possible picture, sometimes in spite of my efforts. ;-). There is significant adjustability that allows me to choose shutter or aperture priority so I can be as creative as I wish if the situation calls for it -- or I can choose one of two automatic point-and-shoot settings if I am just snapping pictures. The dials, buttons, knobs & menus are easy to use.  The scene position modes allow you to select SR Auto (scene recognition helps me frame the scene & automatically chooses the ideal settings), Auto (for ordinary snapshots),  Advanced mode (lots of flexibility with this one), Custom (accepts user preferences), Aperture priority (sets the aperture), Shutter priority (sets the shutter speed), Scene positions (helps me match the scene with the settings I have chossen), Program AE (allows me to use settings other than the aperture & shutter priorities), and motion panorama (allows me to sweep the camera right or lift for panoramic pictures). I have just started using some of these settings & I like what I see.When I know the kinds of pictures I would like to take, the s8200 gives me position settings that help get the best picture. I can use Portrait, Landscape, Night, Night (Tripod), Snow, Flower, Baby, Smart, Fireworks, Beach, Text, Smile & Shoot, Sunset & Party. As I said earlier, the camera is smarter than I am right now, but I'm learning and I'm not feeling stressed about these features.The Fufjifilm s8200 also has video capabilities, but I'm not into them ... yet. As I said, I can learn as I go without feeling threatened by my camera.One of the best reasons to buy a  Fujifilm s8200? Other cameras with the same or similar features are more than double or triple the cost of the s8200.The s8200 takes easy-to-find AA batteries. Although I bought extra specialized rechargeable batteries for my older digitals, I still found myself running out of power at the most inopertune moments. I can deal with a battery emergency with less stress because AA batteries are everywhere.OK, so what don't I like? Well, It is heavier than the point-and-shoot digitals I've been using, but it is surprisingly light when I compare it with my previous 35 mm experience. I know that is a HUGE variation, but the s8200's weight is not an issue for me. Sure, it's bigger, thicker, wider, etc, but I feel like I am using a real camera. OK, so I can't carry it in my pocket ... or my purse. Well, I guess I could get a bigger purse (just kidding!). When I bought the camera, I also bought a delightful little camera bag that is just the right size for the camera & a few accessories.If you like to switch lenses, the s8200 is not for you. It has a fixed lens with enough flexibility to meet my needs. I do not need to have specialized extra lenses to worry about. I am gladly giving up the extra lenses for my 8200's scene position settings.Overall, I am happy.

Apparently many people don't bother to frame a picture before snapping since most screens are not visible in even moderate sun.  The eye piece in this is a TV screen with very poor resolution and I find it frustrating to use.  I also wanted a camera that could take fast flash pix of my active grandkids.  While it does freeze the action well, the flash takes its time about being ready to go.  The stabilizer in the camera seems pretty good, I can manage to take much better telephoto shots with this camera and action shots come out remarkably clear.  Again, I am lazy, no tripod for me.  The various options on the camera are far more complicated than I wanted and I don't have the patience to make learning to use the camera a big priority. It's not intuitive IMO.  Also I find colors are a little off.  I also haven't figured out how to use it in bright sun.  I really hate having to try to re-set all the parameters every time I want to take a picture.

Phillips", "ReviewID": "RY08Y72I7YBPX", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I bought this camera as a bridge camera when I didn't want to be carrying my DSLR. In the past I've always owned Canon cameras and this time I was again expecting to buy a Canon. However, when features and price were factored in there is simply no way that the Canon bridge cameras will measure up--particularly when they are producing cameras that do not use AA batteries and then have well documented problems with battery life. Nevertheless, I was hesitant to go with the S8200 because of some reviews of poor picture quality. I needn't have been.The picture quality on the S8200 is equally as good as the Canon Poweshot cameras I've owned in the past. The lens is equally as sharp, though a bit slower. As far as features go the S8200 cannot be beat in this price range. I have taken it on outings doing landscape work, birding etc. and it performs as expected.The only drawbacks I've noticed concern low light performance. The camera does have problems focusing in low light situations, but then, I've also found that this can often be corrected by using one of the special settings that are there to handle such situations.While I haven't used the video much at all, when I have used it I have gotten excellent quality images and they have been easily uploaded to Windows Media Player or other such software such as Corel.The bottom line is that this camera performs amazingly well for a bridge camera. It is not a DSLR, so don't expect it to perform as one. However, I highly recommend the S8200 if you are looking for a camera that feels good in your hands, has plenty of features, produces good images and therefore prompts you to take more pictures--which is what a bridge camera should do.", "Date": "February 17, 2014"}, {"Title": "great camera", "Author": "LB", "ReviewID": "R2B70M4XPVJC23", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I bought it for my husband for his Birthday gift.

The noise is less than what is produced with the Fuji Finepix F900EXR.This camera can take nice close up portraits indoors with the flash. It will usually choose ISO 100 resulting in no noise, & the colors are true to life with detail in the picture.The flash covers a good range & produces good color in the photos. If not using flash indoors expect iso from 800 to 1600 with noise, but the photos are still usable & look nice at normal size prints.Camera uses 4 AA batteries, so we bought a nimh battery charger & 2400 mAh rechargeable batteries.This camera surprised me in that in can produce pretty blurry backgrounds with close up macro shots or full zoom in full auto mode. This is my 8 year old son's camera, & he has done it several times w/o trying.Video is great for not being a dedicated camcorder. 1080p with continual autofocus. No complaints.

Way too noisy (with or without flash); the zoom is very very noisy as well--not just when taking video but when just taking pix; shutter button takes more effort that it should to take a picture; and the battery compartment lid feels like it would break extremely easily when using the camera frequently--and sadly that's also where the SD card goes as well (I transfer my pix via the SD card plugged into my laptop--lots of transferring). .Sorry. had to send back.", "Date": "March 6, 2014"}, {"Title": "Awesome, but not perfect.", "Author": "S.
