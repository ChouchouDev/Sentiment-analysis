{"Reviews": [{"Title": "Good, long zoom p&s; cam", "Author": "PSBone", "ReviewID": "R2P4058SZIAG7W", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "I primarily chose this because it had Dog and Cat Scene modes, see my pix. It's pretty cool as it detects your pets face and automatically shoots, no shutter pressing. I like its also easy to navigate around the cams contorls, zoom is smooth tho haven't use it at the longest end as you'll need very steady hands, and it locks onto its subject quite well. Read another review complaining about the macro mode, w/c even tho I haven't used this cam extensively for that, does suffer from poor focusing or blurry shots. He also mentions the Flash, which you'll have to pop up yourself. I never had problems setting my Flash to Auto and it not firing, so i have no complaints here. If you've seen my pix, indoor shots are pretty good as long as lighting is bright enough, low light isn't bad either, but not the best, while Outdoor shots are sharp and excellent.All in all not a bad cam, takes good pix, focuses well, not the speediest, but not slow either. Pix are surprisingly sharp and clear, zoom works. Size-wise it's compact, just a tad bulky due to its 26X zoom lens, but design wise love it's very good grip.Also, I've seen Amazon say that the SP-820uz is a newer model, it's not, it's their highest end model with higher zoom and more features. It's also a bit bigger.Just wanted to add, as per someone asking if the zoom works in video mode, it does. It's a bit slow, it'll blur slightly while zooming but focuses well in the end and you'll hear the zoom motor working, not loudly, so your audio will be slightly muted while in use. If your not using the zoom or stopped, audio is fine and unaffected.", "Date": "April 13, 2013"}, {"Title": "great camera for the price.", "Author": "Joseph Denby", "ReviewID": "R1U6PE4BBVX9FV", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "You couldn't ask for a better camera for the price. it looks nice. its very easy to use. only a few buttons to navigate the interface with is quite intuitive. I really just wanted a camera to take some nice pictures on trips and things and didn't really care about all the extra features, however after playing with some of the extra features on this camera, i'm happy it has them. The automatic panorama is very cool and simple to use. Has some fun color and image effects. The 1080p video it take looks great.  The main reason i chose this camera was the built in (but removable) battery and charger, so i never have to keep buying batteries all the time. I have yet to drain the battery completely before i was able to charge it again. You can also charge the battery by hooking it to a computer via USB so that is nice.Its a point and shoot camera not a DSLR. i was fully aware of that when i got it.. but it does look like a DSLR camera and has a good weight to it and fits comfortably into your hands.", "Date": "August 14, 2013"}, {"Title": "Amazing camera!", "Author": "Jeff", "ReviewID": "R37DDMF6JO8DGO", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "This camera is an awesome buy, the quality of the pictures and videos is astounding.

I haven't used the video format on it yet so I can't comment on that, but the camera takes great photos. Read through the manual though and take some practice shots around your home to get a feel for how the camera works.

Both the 3D data (MPO format) and the JPEG data are saved. 3D Photo can be used in Auto (after the first shot is complete, the second shot will automatically be taken once the camera is moved to match the target) and Manual (after the first shot is complete, the user takes the second shot after matching the semi-transparent layers). To play back, users simply select 3D Photo or regular photo, and then images can be viewed on a 3D compatible TV or computer.MPO Files (Multi Picture Format)This is a file format that conforms to CIPA standards for treating multiple images as a single image file. With 3D Photo, the two images with a disparity between the left and right eyes are merged into a single image and recorded as a Multi Picture Format file.Pet Mode (Scene Mode)*8Dogs and cats are automatically detected. By selecting Pet-cat or Pet-dog modes, the camera will automatically detect cats or dogs and focus on their faces. Up to ten dog or cat faces can be detected.Auto ShutterCapture pets' cute expressions. With Auto Shutter, the camera will automatically shoot when a pet faces the camera head-on.
