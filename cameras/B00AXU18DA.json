Right now I own 2 D90s, with the requisite lenses for portraits, bird photography and wide angle shots.  I've recently been diving again, and used my daughter's Nikon AW100 for shallow dive shots.  Works well on silhouette shots but everything looks washed out with the flash on underwater.  Plus, there is quite a learning curve on the AW.  And should I intend to go any deeper, Nikon doesn't offer housing for it!  Enter the Olympus TG-2, which I first heard about from a respected underwater photographer.  It's good for 50 feet, and can come with housing if required.  Its varied features include multiple scene modes--I counted 3 different options for underwater photography alone.  Of course, I could do without pet cat mode (there's already a pet dog mode--why not one mode for both?).  My first foray into the water resulted in amazing macro shots (thanks to its underwater macro setting).  The beach/snow mode looks like an UWA capture, which tempered the brightness and captured the crispness of the clouds, the different blue hues of the water.  There's even a cuisine mode--for those with food photo fetishes.  If I were to have to rely on my DSLRs for these shots, it would have required multiple lens changes, even strobes.  Which brings me to conclude:  if I were to have just 1 camera, it would be this one.", "Date": "July 24, 2013"}], "ProductInfo": {"Price": null, "Features": null, "Name": null, "ImgURL": null, "ProductID": "B00AXU18DA"}}
