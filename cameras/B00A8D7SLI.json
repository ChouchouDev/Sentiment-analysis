I made the purchase,  When I received it I was very impressed how thin and light weight it is so I did test drive it , the photos are stunning very sharp and clear. I kept it for myself and purchased another one for Tammy. Also I must say it has loads of features  that I don't even know yet, need to read the manual. I recommend it. It deserves a 5 star.", "Date": "May 30, 2013"}, {"Title": "Great Xmas Gift.............", "Author": "DomesticDame", "ReviewID": "R1NMSEGSV17S10", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "Gave this to our adult son as one of his gifts.  Did not want to put a lot of money into it, as it was a after thought when he shared that he had accidently dropped his former camera from a three story stairwell.  Turns out, he was thrilled after setting it up.  Started using it almost immediately and the pictures were great.  In fact, I was so impressed, I plan to order one for us to take on a trip.  This size is very small and so much easier to carry then what we have.  excellent camera for the price....", "Date": "January 21, 2014"}, {"Title": "Amazing camera for the price", "Author": "Jessi", "ReviewID": "R1MKMEUDHB0TG3", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "Does the job,  nice pictures , easy to use ,very compact.
