If the previous line is true for you, this review can be helpful for you.This is a digital camera to take pictures without worrying about the technical aspects of photography. You have plenty of scenes modes that will automatic adjust the appropriate settings for the picture, so it is an automatic digital camera, there are a few settings that you can adjust manually but those ones aren't the key ones of professional photography.Almost every Nikon's camera I used have great quality, this one is a better and more interesting model because it is from a new generation of Nikon's digital cameras, so on the Nikon's learning curve, this one of the latest state of the art consumer digital camera (September 2005).So I give you a few tips in order to help you on the decision of buying this product:1. Great photo quality, read the entire manual before and after you first shoots (Don't complaint about quality if you fail to do so). Get a tripod if you can.2. It is automatic, great for a person that only wants to get decent, great pictures and from time to time take wonderful ones without being experts on the technical world of photography; I if you find yourself falling in love with photography, take some curses and then buy a pro or an almost professional camera.3.  Great photo quality! Nikon has it! The best way to notice this fact it is looking at the \"view shared images from other users\" on the models and brands you want to choose from.  Let your eyes make the decision.4. Visit web sites where you can find information about megapixels, autofocus, composing pictures with autofocus, multi area focus, memory cards, and rechargeable batteries. You will find this information helpful on the future and on your buying decision.5. L1 has a 5x zoom lenses, a close up from 1.6 inches. This optical combo is hard to find on the market. 6.2 Megapixels, excellent definition.Cons:1. Multi Area Focus, great new feature on L1. Bad explain it on the manual. I recommend you get the default setting to Auto Focus Center and then take a tour on the internet in order to fully understand what Multi Are Focus is and how you can take advantage of this feature.2. Be aware on buying mini tripods, this digital camera has the tripod adapter on the left side of it, making the camera not well weighted; try mini tripods before buying one. You won't have problems with normal tripods.I used other brands, I keep Nikon. I hope your had find this review helpful for you.", "Date": "October 15, 2005"}, {"Title": "Beautiful Pictures, Great Camera", "Author": "missk7 \"missk7\"", "ReviewID": "R2EUE407DEC165", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I have had this camera for almost 6 months and have never had any complaints.  It is a really universal camera that will take beautiful pictures in a wide range of settings.I saw that some people left reviews about the camera being having blurry pictures and I have not had this issue at all, even without a tripod.  (They must have mistakenly reset some of the settings) The colors come out beautifully.  The settings are logical and easy to use, but I still recommend reading the instructions.  With this camera, and knowing how it works, you can take beautiful, professional-looking photographs.I do recommend investing in a good pair of batteries, but this is true with all digital cameras these days.  As the cameras get more powerful they need more power and I have not seen any new camera out there that you can get more than 30-40 pictures on a regular pair of alkaline batteries.  And the type of memory card you use makes a BIG difference in the time between shots, again this is true of all cameras.Overall, I will never buy another camera except Nikon.  This camera helped me capture perfectly come of the most important moments of my life and I could not be more pleased.", "Date": "April 29, 2006"}, {"Title": "excellent pictures just need to outfit it right - oh, and tough", "Author": "Scott A. Gallaher", "ReviewID": "RAPH0533GK6J1", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "Excellent pictures, easy, intuitive interface, and a great 5X zoom that really makes the difference compared to 3X or even 3.5X are all the things I really like about this camera. There are some negative reviews on this product but I would counter with this: accept the fact that AA Lithiums are the only way to go and spring for a solid, dependable, ultra-high speed SD card and you'll be fine and happy. The LCD screen is the view finder and I have no problems with it-- I live in Phoenix and it is very, very, bright here to say the least. I have taken over 200 pictures with the camera on one set of batteries, so far, and it's been four days since I've had the camera. I use the Energizer Lithium AA's (are there any others?). For an SD card I use the SanDisk Ultra II 1 Gig (currently like $50 on Amazon) and the card is significantly faster than the Lexar I bought at Sam's. Yes, with the flash, you still have to wait-- but the faster the memory, the less you will have to wait. Without the flash, even on the 6mp + setting, it still only takes a second or two to write to the card. I like the fact that the camera has a tiny bit of bulk to it making it more \"grippy\" for my hands. Using AA's for me is great because I really hope to do a lot of travelling and hiking and I know that I can pack one pair of spare AA lithium batteris that weigh nothing and be fine for a whole week of solid picture-taking. I also know what can happen on 100 foot escparments and accidents with a $1000 digital SLR, so given the current street price, the outstanding quality of the pictures, the street price, the zoom, the street price, and the fact that I use the camera for travel, this camera was a great buy for me. Also, I think the shortcomings are manageable, in my opinion. What are they? Lithium batteries are the most expensive kind so if you plan on using the camera 24X7 365 days a year, then probably you should look at a different kind of power supply! The camera doesn't offer the sheer speed of an SLR in picture capture, so if you are going to be bouncing around in a jeep on an African safari, then you might want to go with an SLR or Nikon's P3 or P4 with \"vibration reduction.\" But for me, I bought this camera for five things: 5X digital zoom, great pictures, SD card memory-type, double AA battery power, and ease of use.-May 29th update dumped camera inside makeshift vinyl case into a fast moving creek. went running downstream after something else, then noticed my Nikon bobbing through my ankles. Picked it up, took the batteries out immediately, took the memory out, let everything dry for 48 hours, put the batteries back in..... the camera still works fine.

For this reason mainly i decided the next bussines day go back to the store and change the Sony for a Nikon and i bought the Coolpix L1. i have taken very nice pictures in all posible conditions, at the beach, sunsets, indoors, outdoors, at night, noon, etc and all great.read the manual in order to take the best out of this camera, but if you don't read it, still will get nice pics.the only thing i regret is the lack of a AF light, which definitly would make AF in low light easyer and faster, other than that, very niceJuly 11 2006 UPDATEAfter several month using my Nikon, i decided to change it because the time it takes to focus on most indoor conditions is too long most of the times. i looked imn the market and decided to go for Sony again but this time i bought the DSC-W50, and the change is amazing, better AF speed and accuracy, not to mentiont the better flash power in night conditions.i dislike the quiality of the Nikon's pics at night, but i'm very satisfied with the results with the DSC-W50.I cannot say the Nikon is a bad camera, but for sure there are better options for the price range.i took my time to research and went for the Sony over Samsung and equally priced Panasonics, not to mention Cannon (i was afraid with so many comments regarding some misterius lense error a lot of people complains about)If i could i'd lower the stars for this camera to 3 instead of the 4 i gave it a whyle ago.", "Date": "February 24, 2006"}, {"Title": "Great Little Camera", "Author": "rachels \"rss\"", "ReviewID": "RMZN5MJAPT2KG", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "this camera is great.

Cass", "ReviewID": "RSOPXCZ1CCPO1", "Overall": "1.0", "Content": "My first digital camera was a Nikon coolpix 3700.  I *loved* that camera.  It was fast, light, compact, very durable, and took excellent qaulity photos.  It's fatal flaw was it's custom battery is charged by a charger that is no longer in production.  Damage the charger, and the camera is pretty much useless.This camera has none of these qualities.  Being brand loyal, all the while remembering my lession from my experience above, I searched for a Nikon camera with more standard batteries, and finally settled on the L1.  What a mistake.  The camera is heavier, bulky, poorly constructed, s-l-o-w,  and the pictures it takes leave everything to be desired.Some specific complaints:- Delamination:  almost immediately, the protective coating (?) began flaking off, making it look ugly.- Eats batteries:  My original PUNY 128MB SD memory card cosistantly outlasts regular AA batteries.  And this thing is a 6 megapixel camera!  Do the math...- Slow reponse time: There is a unacceptably long delay between pressing the button and when the camera actually takes the picture... at least a second, longer with the flash.  Makes taking an action shot or pictures of kids impossible.- Slow recovery time: There is a infurating long delay between when the camera takes a picture and when the camera is ready to take another picture.  I've tried high-quality batteries, and fast memory cards, to no avail.- Inability to Focus:  I've all but given up on trying to take a photo that is in focus.  This camera takes forever to focus, and 9 times out of 10 fails to focus correctly.  I mean, this isn't rocket science...- Battery/Memory Card Access Door:  First, how stupid to put them in the same place.  If you want to change the memory stick, you end up removing power from the camera.  Bad design.  Also, the access door is held in place by a miniscule piece of plastic that (at least in my case) breaks quickly.Look elsewhere... Nikon is a good brand, but they failed with this one.  Bigtime.", "Date": "December 25, 2006"}, {"Title": "Good deal", "Author": "C. Yoon \"ChuckY\"", "ReviewID": "RAPZ9TGKRAO9M", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "This is a great camera!  So great I decided to write a review!First of all, I have to say this is for Beginner or Intermediate photographers who want an easy to use camera.  If you're wanting a lot of flexibility such as setting fstops, shutter speed, adding lenses, etc... This camera is not for you.  This is a easy to use no thinking fun camera.Not only is it easy to use, but it has a lot of easy options when you set it in the different modes.  At first it seems intimidating as there are a lot of options, but if you play with it for awhile, you'll soon learn to mostly use a few of the many options available.  I think the picture quality is great.  This camera also has a macro mode that lets you take good close up pictures that are clear.  This camera also has a 5X zoom which is much better when compared to the average 3X zoom offered on other cameras.I've read some reviews that say this is a blurry camera, and I must say, there is some slowness in the focus, and it does not take great pictures if you turn off the flash.  But if you're willing to take mostly flash or outdoor pictures, most pictures should come out great!Unfortunately the required flash really wears down the batteries.  I reccomend picking up some rechargables, and also picking up the Nikon EH-62B AC Adapter so you can plug your camera in when reviewing pictures or transfering them to your computer.  This will save you tons on your batteries.I also love the video mode on this camera.  It looks great for a still photography digital camera.  I use to think this was a lame feature offered in order for camera makers could offer it as a feature, but when I use to see this on older cameras, it was mostly useless because the audio was bad, and the video was choppy and looked terrible, but on this camera, it looks not all that bad.  It actually looks pretty decent.  I'm definitely going to use it lots more than I ever thought I'd ever use it.  It's just so great to have a mini video camera in such a small package.  Althought if you must use this camera as a video recorder, I reccomend picking up an SD card that can write at least 20 M/Sec.  I would use the Sandisk Extreme 3 card or the ATP 150X card.  Depending on how much video you want to shoot, get a large card.  I have a 2 gig card, and it will record about 53 minutes of video at 320X240 mode.  This camera also has a 640X480 mode, but the quality is terrible in that mode and it's very choppy and films at only 15 frames/second while the other modes shoot at 30 frames/second.  I read a review trashing the video on this camera, but that reviewer seemed to want a video camera.  His complaints are valid, but this camera isn't meant to be a video camera, so I don't get why he's complaining.  This is just a bonus feature that works well IMO.In conclusion, I think this camera is a great deal for the casual photographer. The video is really fun for capturing little moments.  I wouldn't reccomend this camera for artistic or advanced photographers who want to really fine tune the controls or for people who want to shoot in low light conditions without a flash.", "Date": "October 15, 2006"}, {"Title": "This camera is awesome", "Author": "David Paulk", "ReviewID": "RC80L2OPAWRQN", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "I bought this camera about two weeks ago, and the first place I used it was in Seattle, WA.

The pictures turned out great, several pics I took throughout the city almost look professional.If you are considering buying this camera and are on a tight budget (like i was), definitely get it.

I am not disappointed.The L1 is a nice, compact size and works on AA batteries, which is extra cool because you can get rechargeable batteries and one of those 15 minute chargers to keep you in business.  Plus, having the AA batteries rather than an internal battery means cheap replacements and upgrades when the time comes, which is also key.The pictures it takes are really nice, far better than my last camera.  I'm a fairly entry-level point-and-shoot kind of photographer, and I'm happy with how my pictures turn out.The size of the camera is nice and makes it convenient to take with you on day trips and such.  My last camera was bulky, and form factor was key on this new purchase.  The size is just right - not too large to be inconvenient, but not so small that the preview LCD is unusable.In fact, the preview LCD is super clear and much more usable than many other cameras I looked at.  It's high enough resolution to make menus and icons very clear and the colors are reasonably vibrant.The scene assistant feature is really nice, helping you to automate the configuration of various settings (flash, exposure, etc.) based on common situations (sunset, portrait, fireworks show, party, etc.).  My favorite is the \"panorama assist,\" which helps you to line up successive shots in a panorama.  I didn't even know about that when I bought it, and it's been one of my most used features on the camera.The only real downside is there's not much in the way of automatic picture stabilization, so you really have to hold still when you're taking a picture.  It's not as bad as all that - most of my pictures turn out great - but you can tell a few are slightly blurry because I moved at the wrong moment.  If you're going to use this one a lot, you might want to look into one of those little tripods.All in all, I'm really happy with it.", "Date": "July 31, 2006"}, {"Title": "Not sure why....", "Author": "MMaclover", "ReviewID": "RQYQAZX4PQ936", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I am not sure why so many people dislike this camera.

Yes, I do get blurry pictures from time to time, but being a child to two more advance photograghers, I know it is more of an issue with me than with the actual camera.

The only trouble I've had is trying to use the detail focus functions without a tripod.  In these shooting modes, the camera will notice your wobbling hands and take blurry pictures as a result.  I haven't used the video feature enough, but it works well so far.  For thus just getting into digital photo, this camera is awesome.  Very easy to use and great quality for the price.

I was initally enticed by the size of the camera, the large LCD and the 6mp. I was replacing a Canon a75 and figured this camera would do just as good quality wise, with a higher resoution. Boy was I wrong. First of all bAttery life is PATHETIC. I was charging my 2100mah NiMh batteries but still wanted to play with the new \"toy\", so I popped a set of Duracell Alkalines in. Within 45mins(35 or so pics) the batteries were totally exhausted. Thinking I had a bad set I used another. This time i got about 40 pictures and they were dead. This is TOTALLY unacceptable. Once the rechargeables were charged, i put them in for a test. As expected run time was extended to about 1.5 hours or about 80 photos). Again, disappointing. Now onto picture quality. To sum it up. Daytime shots were acceptable. Macro mode yielded the best picture, funnily enough and Indoor/Low light shots were almost ALWAYS blurry. There is no AF assist lamp, nor the ability to adjust ISO to defeat the blurriness. Again, totally unacceptable for a camera in this price range. Nikon loads this camera up with useless features such as BSS(Best shot Selector), which should actually be labeled WSS(Worst shot selector); facial recognition(doesnt work) and the blurry photo detector(which works great.....and is illuminated most of the time......which just backs my previous statments of poor quality, blurry prints.95% of the photographing community does not NEED a 6mp camera. For most a 4mp will work. Save yourself the money and the grief and get a good 4mp camera like the Canon A85 or A520. Heck even the $135 Sony Cyber-shot\u00ae DSC-S40 is a MUCH better choice.", "Date": "January 12, 2006"}, {"Title": "Could be awesome with a couple of changes", "Author": "Blank Stare", "ReviewID": "RCZ288RBYPM3Q", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "I love the pictures this camera takes but I don't like the camera very much.  It's small but not beautifully designed like so many of the other cameras that are out now. It's also really heavy for its size so I don't take it with me in my purse like I planned.For the price it offers a superior lens, great zoom, great mp, lots of features, and the price was good.  Too bad it's so ugly.I also liked that it runs on normal batteries but this turns out to be a problem.  Normal batteries run down really quickly (maybe an hour or so, the rechargeable batteries last longer) so I strongly suggest only using rechargeable batteries.  The camera gives no signal when the charge is low and just stops working with the lens still sticking out so you always have to carry extra batteries with you.  I guess I should have returned it because this is probably a malfunction but didn't manage to in time.Other than that, this takes the most beautiful photos in the world (well, hehe, within my limited capacity).  When shopping I read that getting a good lens is the most important thing when shopping for a camera and that Canon and Nikon make the best lenses.  I've owned a Canon and never really liked the photos I took with it (I'm the only person you'll ever hear that from by the way).  This Nikon is really incredible though. This is my first digital camera and am having a lot of fun with all the settings.  Just being able to adjust the White Settings according to types of lighting is awesome because you can take indoor shots with much less color distortion.  You can take a picture in almost pitch black and still capture an image.  I keep it on amped up Color mode all the time because I'm a painter and have never liked the grayed down images of photography.Another negative trait is that the camera is so slow.  It hasn't really made much of a difference when I'm taking pictures but if you're trying to take pictures of your kids at sporting events you might miss something. I haven't used the video mode.Eventually I would like to buy a Sony because that lens takes very sharp, crisp \"techno\" style pictures and is small enough to carry around all the time, but I don't want to get rid of this one because it makes me feel like I'm Rembrandt.Good Luck with your Shopping Hell.", "Date": "October 6, 2006"}, {"Title": "Great camera!!", "Author": "Shop Girl", "ReviewID": "R3MQ8ZR2WAEL8E", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "It took me a while to decide which camera to buy, and I'm extremely happy I purchased the Coolpix L1.

Had my eye on the simialarly featured & priced Panasonic L3, but the salesman convinced me that this was more camera for my money because it had more features. Brought it home & took a few pictures in different settings- everyone of them came out blurry.. tested it on my ceiling fan and it was a blurred shadow.  So I read the directions and reset the camera to it's original settings- Only then was I able to get  some very nice, clear shots.  Still having a problem with the zoom & blurring, and the camera will auto focus perfectly on a subject in macro or zoom- then pull back out of focus and blink red.. try again.  It focuses when it wants to focus, and when you are taking pictures you don't always have an hour to set up the shot to the camera's liking.  Also it was near impossible for me (not a complete novice to digital cameras either) to get a clear shot in any mode other than auto- so all those extra features were worthless unless I wanted to lug around a tripod everywhere I went. If you will notice even the best reviews here all say \"get a tripod\", I mean lets be practical here- how many people expect to have to use a tripod on a $200- $300 range 'point & shoot' camera? If I wanted a professional set up I would have spent and extra $100 on an SLR and even that would have worked better as a point & shoot! The camera took forever to write to the card, and the screen would display the image you shot for a second- then go blank for 3-4 seconds while it wrote to the card.  Meantime you could not take another picture until it was done.  Sure a higher speed card would write faster, but the same SD card is working just fine in the Panasonic I exchanged it for.  Another thing I didn't like was the fact that that beautiful 2.5 inch LCD was cluttered with a thousand little symbols at all times, you could barely see your picture.  And the battery life- Are they freaking kidding me with that?  My good quality fully charged NI-MH rechargables lasted about 10 minutes before the camera display added yet another symbol to the screen- the flashing \"your battery is dying\" symbol- expect to see that one all the time if you buy this camera.  Seriously, for  a day at the park you would need to carry at least four sets of batteries!  Now the same batteries are in the Panasonic for about 40 pics so far, and at least an hour total of messing around with the new settings and they are still not low.  I decided that the L3 with less features and an easier interface was worth exchanging it for- then I saw the L5 for the same price-  Has even more features, still MUCH simpler to understand and image stabalization so that sweet 6X optical zoom is not completely worthless without a tripod.

I have dropped it countless times in the snow, in puddles, on cement, and it still works well. However, this camera is kind of hard to use for action shots. When you press the shutter button, it takes a full two seconds to take the shot. Two seconds may not seem like much, but, for example, when you want to take a shot of someone kicking a soccer ball right as it leaves the ground, after two seconds, the ball is a lot farther away.

I shot The Cure during a show at the Wolstein Center in Cleveland on June 18, 2008, and I got close to 250 shots before I had to switch the batteries. Also, the quality of said photos has more to do with the photographer than the camera. Don't blame the camera because all of your shots come out blurry. Play with the settings and stabilize yourself when possible, and seriously, don't expect every single shot to come out amazing. Perhaps you could do that with enough skill using an SLR, but with a point-and-shoot, it's not realistic, so be realistic, and you won't be disappointed. :)With that said, I do plan on upgrading to a better camera soon, but this model has served me well, and I'd recommend it to anyone.", "Date": "June 25, 2008"}, {"Title": "Great first generation", "Author": "M.

The one-touch buttons are easy to use, and the camera has cool features such as portrait or landscape help. You press that, and it gives you place holders of where the heads should be, or how to align things, so that you can have better composed pictures.

I shopped around and bought into the 6.2 megapixels and 5x zoom Nikkor lens. The still photos are not my main problem (although the monitor can get crowded and saving each shot takes longer than I would have liked). Here is my main problem: the video function of the camera. First, while capturing video there is no way to adjust the zoom. Second, and most importantly the audio that is captured along with the video includes noises from within the camera. This is caused due to the sensitive mic being so close to the lens which is constantly refocusing. The noise that is picked up renders the audio element of the video captures, useless. There is a way to improve the audio quality: by setting the camera up to only focus in the beginning of the shot, which eliminates some of the sound problems picked up but a) does not totally avoid them and b) it has to keep that one focus for the entire shot - potentially a problem depending on what you are shooting. I have to say the images themselves are fine but I wanted a point and shoot with video capabilities (both video & audio) and this camera fails to deliver that. There are many cameras I have seen and used since that do not have this audio problem in the playback of the videos so please look into this before purchasing if this is an important function for you.
