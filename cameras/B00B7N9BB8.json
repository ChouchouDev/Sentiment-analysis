Most places in my area were selling the bundle for a Mother's Day special...I really like the plum color too.  I had a bunch of questions before buying it due to all the bad or so so reviews.  I like this camera.  It fits almost anywhere, it works the way the manual says it should, it charges fast, the pics look good and I even took some of my pets which were not blurry as some have stated.  Maybe my pets are not quick to move.  I got this to take on a 2 week east coast trip and wanted something that was easier to carry than my other camera.  I'm happy with it so far and can't complain.  I did buy an extra battery since I was not sure how long the battery life was.***UPDATE****I bought this camera for a 2 week trip to the east coast.  Four days into my trip, the camera lens would not extend when turned on.  When the lens finally did extend, the camera would not focus and if I tried to zoom, it would only zoom a millimeter, turn itself off and give me a Lens Error.  I called the camera shop I bought it from to see if there was something going on that I just needed to reset the camera, but they were no help.  They told me I would have to bring the camera in and they would check it to see if I had done something to cause the lens to get off track.  Meanwhile, I'm on day 4 of a 14 day trip now without a camera.  I bought another one to use for my trip and once home, I returned the broken one.  I'm hoping the same thing doesn't happen again.  All the pictures I took came out perfect, so if the lens \"stays on track\" this little camera does take nice shots, but I'm really iffy on it now.", "Date": "May 12, 2013"}, {"Title": "BooooO!", "Author": "Erica", "ReviewID": "R2APGXEWU60A70", "Overall": "3.0", "Content": "This camera worked fine (never dropped or abused) and then ALL OF A SUDDEN it stopped working.

The battery is completely charged.  What the heck?  I hate it when things stop working for absolutely NO REASON.UPDATE 11/27/13:  The camera was still under warranty.

After reading all of the reviews on the Nikon 5200 I decided to purchase it. I had the camera for three days and returned it.The first thing I noticed was that I could not just hit the play button to view pictures and video, but I had to actually turn on the camera.  When you power the camera the lens extends, where in the Canon, you hit the play button and you can view pictures and videos and your lens retracted with the lens cover closed.The second issue I had was how the camera charges. You have to put the battery in the camera and plug  the power cord into the camera to charge the battery. I assume that Nikon makes a separate charger, but unlike Canon, Nikon does not provide one with the camera.I probably could have gotten past these two things, if I did not encounter the next two issues. I have a DSL camera and have had other point and shots in the past. I have never had an issue taking a picture of something moving.  My pictures always come out clear and blur free, but not with this Nikon. Majority of the pictures taken over the past three days were blurry and the camera had a VERY hard time focusing. This seemed to be the issue whether I used full auto with auto scene select or when I set the scene to one that fit best. In the past with Canon I have used Kids and Pets and my pictures have come out clear even if the subject moved last minute.My son is 9 months old and like many things in life there are no second chances and I need a camera that will capture the moment the first time!

But even at the discounted price, it was not worth the money!  The battery life was virtually non-existent (we were amazed at how quickly the battery drained!).  Most pictures with the zoom quality were very poor, especially indoor pictures - most  are blurry using the zoom (we assume some of this was due to our getting used to the camera).However, the coup d'\u00e9tat - when attending an outdoor event, front row seats, and looking forward to using the zoom - the camera stopped working!  It turned on, the lense extended for a few seconds and then closed, and then the 'lens error' message appeared.  After the event, via a computer blog, I trouble shooted the matter, tried what was recommended - take battery out, put back in, charge the battery, etc.  Did not correct the situation.  In total, we had the camera for 10 days before it malfunctioned.This is so disappointing!  We always thought that Nikkon made quality products so we did not think about checking consumer ratings.  And, when considering other Nikkon Coolpix cameras, according to the consumer ratings reviewed, there are problems with this Nikkon camera product range, so it is not worth the risk or the money to try a Nikkon replacement camera.

I returned it to the store for a new camera. That camera also stopped charging after a couple of weeks.

Kept getting lens error also. Tried it several times. Took the battery out, sometimes that resets electronics, nothing. Finally the lens did extend again BUT NOW the auto focus would not work at all! Ugh!Called Nikon, they said take the battery out, try resetting all the factory settings, nothing helped. It would cost me $12 to ship it back to them. They would repair it and send it back to me free. But I was upset it only lasted 19 days! I ended up taking it back to where I bought it and they finally agreed to exchange it. I purchased the extended warranty this time.The pictures turned out GREAT though. Indoor and outdoor, like field day at my daughter's school in class and outside. My husband races motocross and when I took it to the track the zoom worked great. I could zoom in across the track. When I enlarged the picture it kept the clarity.  On sports setting it captured the bike going over the jump crystal clear. The food setting does make food look magazine quality, that was fun to play with. The face recognition feature works really well. It's a very intuitive camera when on the auto setting.Overall the camera was very easy to use. Nice options menu.So I love the pictures and the camera. I really do. I am seriously hoping this lens problem was just a fluke.(thank you to the person who told us how to view the pictures without extending the lens.

Being that I want to take action shots, I wanted something that would allow me to take multiple pictures fairly quickly. This camera does not deliver in that aspect.Pressing the button to take the picture is hit or miss. Sometimes it wants to further focus and other times it'll take. The time between pictures is the bigger problem for me. It takes a good 2-3 seconds before you can take another picture after you've already taken one. This is a killer when trying to capture that special moment.The other reason I bought this camera was because of the WIFI function. The term WIFI is a bit deceiving. What it is actually doing is linking to a WIFI enabled mobile device. You download an app on your phone and link the camera to your phone and it adds some neat features like saving pictures taken on the camera to your phone and the ability to use your phone to remotely snap a picture. Very neat idea. But very clunky and slow. And for some reason, you can not enable the WIFI on the camera unless the battery is fully charged which is very frustrating.I gave two stars just to give the camera the benefit of the doubt that my expectations were too high.", "Date": "January 2, 2014"}, {"Title": "Great !!!", "Author": "Enrique Ustinelli \"Quique\"", "ReviewID": "R3JCAH879YEAPY", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "This is my first pocket camera and I can asure that is great.

I bought it brand new; it never saw any damage. But the general complaint that it is prone to lens error issues is true in my case (luckily, a little troubleshooting fixed it - for now). The wifi option also has serious connection problems which make it essentially useless.One of my biggest complaints is that the button response time is painfully slow. It could take up to three seconds for a command to actually execute (opening a menu, taking a photo, switching camera modes, etc.), which is an eternity if you're trying to capture the moment. The on/off button is positioned ridiculously close to the shutter button, so instead of getting that awesome shot you end up turning the camera off. The zoom itself is often non-responsive or unbelievably slow - again, a photo killer if you're trying to capture something in the moment.The camera has a lot of features, true (180 and 360 options, several photo options), but its benefits are far outweighed by just how annoying it is to operate.

Viewed photos on computer to get a feel of quality.  I was very pleased.  I also viewed photos and video on a 73\" TV and they still looked great IMHO. I shoot with a Sony DSLR A390 must say for a camera that was under $60 total cost delivered you cannot beat the ease of use, easy to carry and versatility of the Nikon Coolpix S5200.

The previous camera was also a Nikon COOLPIX and was less than two years old when it stopped working.This camera stopped working after less than six months. It simply wouldn't turn on.

When I called and asked why it wasn't covered under the warranty I was told that the HDMI port contacts were damaged. Why that would cause the camera to not turn on I do not know, but I explained that the camera had never been connected to anything using the HDMI port. Needless to say I will not pay them more than the camera is worth to repair a problem that should be covered under warranty.I should also note that while I was researching the problem for a possible solution I found NUMEROUS reports of exactly the same problem - the camera simply wouldn't turn on.Personally I will never buy another Nikon product.", "Date": "January 28, 2014"}, {"Title": "Not a bad camera, It will break if you look at it funny", "Author": "anthony", "ReviewID": "R17WQ6QY9WH2KF", "Overall": "3.0", "Content": "I've had three of these coolpix, the camera functions well and you can't beat the price\u2026.You can however beat the camera.
