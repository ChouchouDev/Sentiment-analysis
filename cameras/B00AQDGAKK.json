{"Reviews": [{"Title": "Decent point and shoot, but you may outgrow it in several months", "Author": "Mark B", "ReviewID": "R34EOXPDSWM3YH", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "This little Sony camera is very compact and light, and is a good starter point and shoot at this price.  I take lots of pictures, so I was able to put this camera through its paces over about a three-week period.  Here is a run-down:The Good- Very light and fits in any pocket- Relatively low cost and does not \"feel expensive\", so I do not hesitate to just toss it in my pocket or bag- Has proven to be rugged.  Has survived abuse (per the above bullet) very well- Love the \"Easy\" feature.  It detects background light, fast action, faces, and other photo situations automatically.  You can override this feature in the menus option.- Has plenty of photo-taking options such as landscapes, beach, toy, b&w.; As mentioned below in not-so-good, these features are pretty cumbersome to get to.- Picture quality is very good for this price range.  There is no RAW file option, so you are totally dependent on the camera's JPEG processor, which is okay but has a lot of interpolation.  It is a little slow to process, but definitely adequate below $100.- Uses SD cards, not the proprietary memory stick that Sony had used in the past.The Not So Good- Very menu-driven, so it takes time to find a photo feature (such as toy, b&w;, beach, landscape, etc.) and you could miss your shot.  Best to stay in Auto/Easy mode since it does a decent job of choosing for you.- You have to navigate the menu to deactivate Easy mode before other options become available to you.  This will slow you down a lot and may cause you to miss some shots.  Ideally they would have any Easy mode on/off button on the camera itself.- The processor is slow, so there is a noticeable pause between shots.  The continuous shooting mode labors through about one shot per second.- The post-processing and photo enhancing features on the camera are of limited usefulness.  For example, it has a face enhancement feature that I found was only slightly effective.  You will do MUCH better using your inexpensive desktop photo software to add enhancements.  IMHO, this feature on the camera is more of a gimmick with primitive algorithms.- Sony has opted to use a non-standard USB connector.  I like standard connectors that can be shared between devices.  For this one, you will need to carry around the cord if you want to charge the camera's battery or transfer photos using USB.- To charge, you plug in the camera.  The battery is removable, but the camera does not come with a separate battery charger, so you have to use the camera as the charger. In other words, you cannot charge a spare while you are using the camera.  There may be an accessory for this, but then you are spending extra $$ on a low cost camera.RecommendationIf you want a low-cost, decent point and shoot, this is a good choice, particularly if you want to stay in easy mode most of the time.  If you end up loving photography, or if you are already an experienced photographer, this camera will feel light on features and customization options pretty quickly.", "Date": "June 12, 2013"}, {"Title": "Little Cam that Could", "Author": "A. Dent \"Aragorn\"", "ReviewID": "R3BZ7U4X061M0K", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "I am not going to write a lot about specs but maybe I should note a few features:- Resolution up to 16.1 MP- 5x zoom- Accepts several types of memory cards: Memory Stick (Pro Duo, Pro-HG Duo, Duo, Micro), SD, SDHC, microSD, microSDHC- Rechargeable battery, AC charger, wrist strap and semi-proprietary USB cable included- Small and light- Photo, 360-degree panoramic and 720p video modes- Tripod socket- Relatively easy to navigate menus- Some image processing capabilities- Several levels of 'ease of use' from nearly full automatic to allowing you to set some basic parametersThis is a 'cheap' little camera price-wise but it's a quality build takes surprisingly good pictures when use on full-auto and even better ones if the operator has some basic skills. Yes, it's not a DSLR and it doesn't support Wi-Fi or Bluetooth or 'location' but if you can live without it and you have a kid that wants a camera and don't want to spend a lot getting him one, this is as good a pick as any.Yes, nothing is perfect. I do NOT like Sony's insistence of requiring a non-standard USB cable for charging and data transfer. While you can get around it when it comes to your memory card's file management, you must have a less common UC-E6 USB cable for charging the battery. And based on on my prior experience with a Sony Alpha, their tech support either don't know or won't tell you that you can buy a generic cable but will happily grossly overcharge you for a 'branded' replacement.I also wish the camera came with a case or a little bag, anything to protect it from scratches. Yes, we can supply our own and Sony will be happy to nickel-and-dime you a little and sell you the Sony LCSCSQ Soft Carrying Case for Sony T, W, and N Series Digital Cameras (Black) but I would have preferred to have it as part of the package.Not a negative at all, but it's worth noting that you need to supply your own memory card because the camera 'as is' can only take about 3 pictures. It's not a negative because you should be the one to decide what you want and in what size. After popping in a not so expensive Transcend 32 GB Class 10 SDHC Flash Memory Card the camera tells me that it can take 4710 shots at the highest resolution. Not bad.To conclude, I like Sony's camera a lot and I may end up buying another one for my wife who wants something very small that is 'not a phone'. A case and a more standard USB cable would have made this a 5-star rating but 4 stars (I like it) is not too shabby.", "Date": "May 24, 2013"}, {"Title": "Good camera", "Author": "Liv", "ReviewID": "R3AGDGYGN6LQNE", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "I got this camera on sale for $65 and think it's definitely worth what I paid for it. At the retail price of $98, I think it's an okay buy, but I probably would not pay that much for it. This is an entry-level camera with a handful of special effects. If you're looking for a fancier camera that takes sharper photos, you should probably look at cameras over $100 retail. Even though it's a 2012 model and not being made anymore, at the time I'm writing this review (4/6/13) I recommend the DSC-W650 model over this one for an extra $21 (or less). Though megapixels and zoom are the same as this camera, the nicer lens on the 650 will give you sharper pictures. That being said, this camera also takes some pretty nice pictures. Images on the LCD screen may appear low quality while taking a picture, but images definitely look sharp once they've been taken. The menu is easy to navigate and it's simple to change between effects like toy camera and partial color mode. Videos look pretty nice as well. The camera is small and thin enough to fit in your pocket. The zoom feature, image quality, and special effects take this a step above many cell phone cameras. If you have a decent cell phone camera and don't care about the special effects of this camera, I recommend looking for something more expensive or just sticking with your cell phone. For a budget camera though, you get a variety of nice features and good image quality. It's good for kids and teens and for people who want something very portable and easy to use.", "Date": "April 6, 2013"}, {"Title": "Great Picture Quality", "Author": "Buffy", "ReviewID": "R3FSLWZ18UGG4O", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "This is the fourth or fifth Sony camera I have owned and there's a reason I keep buying Sony: good picture quality. Natural lighting pictures look amazing. Flash photos are very good and you are able to adjust the brightness of the flash to suit your needs. While I prefer to use auto settings for most everything the nice thing is that there is always to option to adjust different settings as needed. 16mp is pretty much overkill but for someone looking to make large prints than you have that choice. Video quality is excellent. The camera is very compact and I probably don't want anything smaller. This camera allows both sd memory cards in addition to Sony's memorystick which gives you flexibility. If there's a negative it's that the battery now needs to be charged in-camera versus in a stand alone battery charger. You connect the camera with the batter in it via a cable to either your computer's usb port or a wall charger that has a usb connection. Either way the battery has to charge in camera which I find inconvenient. The other negative which is new to this camera is that after clicking a picture there is a delay of 4 seconds for the picture to show up on the screen. A little annoying because you want to be able to take a photo and quickly see the result. Previous Sonys I've had were almost instantaneous in showing the picture on the screen. Still this is recommended because the picture quality is good even using auto settings making this a solid point and shoot. 4 stars out of 5.", "Date": "May 18, 2013"}, {"Title": "this camera is awesome...", "Author": "Terry", "ReviewID": "RRJY2B4XQSZU8", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I was using someone else's expensive camera and it was so difficult to use, I couldn't even figure out how to turn off the flash.

The only important thing is that the camera will only work with up to 8GB SD card. I bought a 16GB and the camera would not recognize it.

For my needs, it is perfect. I don't really need super high def pics since mostly what I use a camera for is to take pics of items I plan on selling on ebay or maybe uploading some photos of family(pets included) and friends on one of the various and numerous social sites on the ol' interweb. There probably is better entry level cameras out there for the price, but there's so many it's hard to know which is which. What I can say for sure is that this camera gets the job done if your needs are basic and it's easy to use. It took me about 2-3 hours of \"fiddling\" around with it to get the hang of it.I've had it almost 2 days now and have had no issues with it holding a charge. I also like that this is a really thin and sleek looking camera. Stylish I guess you could say. And it seems pretty durable although I don't  plan on dropping it anytime soon ;) The bottom line is this: If your needs are basic, like mine, and you don't want to spend countless hours researching cameras on the net, then do youself a favor and buy this badboy. For the price you won't find one much better or with many more options on it.", "Date": "May 22, 2013"}, {"Title": "Good Camera But Video Did Not Work On My Blu-ray Player Because of File Format", "Author": "scesq \"scesq\"", "ReviewID": "R2ER9VYEFU5Z5X", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "I like this camera a lot. For a simple to use camera it has a lot of great features. One problem I have though is it won't play video I took with the camera on both my blu-ray players because of the file format of the video.The Bad:My one big issue with this camera is the inability to play video from the camera on either  my Sony or Panasonic blu-ray players because video on this camera is stored in an avi format which is not supported by either of blu-ray players or my tablet.  Also, if you have an older PC that does not support 720p HD the video may not play well on your computer.I called Sony and was also told that while other Sony cameras will allow the video to be stored in multiple formats this one will not. The suggestion I got from Sony to use a third party application to change the video to another format. I bought an SDHC video card to do this.One other minor issue is that it comes with a cable that connects to the camera and has a USB connection at the other end.  This cable is used not only to connect the camera to a computer to transfer photos, but also to connect to an AC adaptor to charge the camera (while the batters is in the camera.)  The AC adaptor is small and could be lost easily. Plus if something happens to the cable you can't charge your camera. I have another camera that has both a battery charger/cable as well as a separate  cable to connect the camera to a computer to transfer photos.The Good:This is a very easy camera to use. I think Sony had the human thumb in mind when designing this camera.  There is a button on the back of the camera that changes the focus from zoom to wide angle, a menu button, a control button and mode button and all are in places where my thumb easily can access them.The Sony software with this camera makes it easy to transfer photos to a computer and edit them. I have tried software from other manufacturers and Sony's is the best by far.The Panoramic Mode button is fun to use. When you get into the mode you see an arrow and boxes on your camera. You then move the camera in the directions of the arrow  (to the right) while pressing down on the shutter button and are told when to stop.  The camera puts the pictures together and the result is a panoramic view.The zoom and wide angle features are easy to use. You just press on a button with your thumb to move the lense.For the most part technical support seems to be above average. I have been critical of other manufactures technical support but Sony's seems a step above.  I called with issues of not being able to watch video from my camera on both of my blu-ray players and on my tablet a couple of times and the agents figured out with a minimal of looking that the video on the camera can only be saved in avi mode. I also called regarding questions about an HDSC memory card and the agents were pretty knowledgeable.I am pleased with the photos.  The camera has features standard to most cameras that allow you to let the camera decide how best to take the picture so if you just want to point and shoot you can.  I have not tried to edit a picture on the camera so I can't comment on this feature.Conclusion:This is a good simple camera with some nice extra features.  It is easy to use with good technical support. I gave it four stars because of the video issue mentioned above.", "Date": "June 19, 2013"}, {"Title": "Great budget camera!", "Author": "Joseph Jenks \"joe\"", "ReviewID": "R26Z1B7UGI9Q47", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "First and foremost, Amazon shipped fast, arrived on time and in good shape. I have been a lifelong Canon user when it comes to small personal cameras. My Prior three cameras were the Canon Powershot SD110, S410, and then the S11000. All those camera's were great, but I noticed they never last me more than a couple of years (mostly due to the extracted zoom lense locking up upon power on). I decided to try out a cheaper Sony camera for once, and this one fit the bill (about $40 cheaper than a powershot). After using it for a couple of weeks, here are my thoughts.. If your looking for a under $100 camera to throw into your purse or pocket, this is the one. The picture quality is great outdoors (indoors is ok), the video quality is adequate, and the rechargeability is quick. The negatives are of course you need your own memory card. Definitely pick up at least a 16gb card (about $12). The camera doesn't come with a case, but those are like $5.

Before this I had a Canon 300HS that I wanted to love, but indoor pictures of people were almost always blurry and it was not user friendly at all to change settings.  This camera however, is very simple to operate and takes great pictures.I did have some trouble - I had to exchange it two times - the first because the battery that came with it was defective.  The second - the camera's casing was loose so it make a creaky sound when use put pressure on the front while using the buttons in the back. But now that I have a good one (cross my fingers) I'm very happy.The intelligent auto is much better at selecting the proper conditions to make a good picture than my old Canon.  It has just enough features to make it feel like a substantial camera, but not so much that it is overwhelming.  It is very user friendly.  I especially like it because it does all the above while being very lightweight and small - perfect for my pocket.  I like how the view screen is recessed.  My canon's was flush with the back of the camera and thus more easily prone to scratching.The only cons I see are that it's very easily to accidentally turn on the camera such as when putting it in a case.  For some reason the on button is pretty sensitive.  But the buttons have a solid `clicky' feel to them and while the camera housing is plastic, it does not feel cheaply made.  The other issue is a think the battery is not as long-lasting as I wish it was.But all of this for a very reasonable price - I paid $89.99.

Taking panoramic shots is a no brainier and the results are great. The menu for me can be a bit confusing, but I guess the settings are useful once you take he time to see what each one does. The camera is a bit light for my taste, but I'm getting used to the weight.

With sensors that small, it's hard to get a sharp picture.However, for a budget-priced camera, the Sony does surprisingly well.  Pictures printed up to 8x10 look great and the resolution is quite nice.  Picture colors are pretty well balanced and pictures taken with a flash look pretty good without the \"bleached\" look that some cameras within this price range might otherwise provide.  That said, I wouldn't expect to do any heavy cropping or print to anything larger, but I'm not expecting that people buying a camera at this price range to do anything of that level.Picture speed is average, but I wasn't expecting miracles.  It took 2-3 seconds to go from picture-to-picture with the flash and about 1-2 seconds without.  I was using a Class 10 SDHC card, so the speed of the memory card is definitely not an issue.  However, don't expect to take any rapid sports action shots with the \"continuous frame\" picture mode - it's not built for that.As for the camera build, it \"feels cheap\" with a mostly plastic body, but the light weight actually is a plus.  It's so light that I can't imagine any extended period of picture-taking is going to cause any fatigue at all.The button layout is where I have an issue with the camera that docks it about 1/2 a star for me.  With the Canon Elph series, the zoom toggle is incorporated as a ring around the shutter which makes it easy for one-finger zoom/picture taking operation.  The Sony, however, curiously has zoom buttons on the BACK of the camera in the top right portion.  This makes it a little awkward for me since I find myself having to use my thumb/index finger...it's not as easy for me since I have small hands to begin with and it's an awkward fit for my thumb.  This might not be an issue for you, but it's something that bothered me during testing.The rest of the camera features have the usual cadre of \"special effects\" and picture modes that fit what you're taking (macro, etc.).

I guess I shouldn't have expected too much of this Sony because of the price, but enough people were saying it took good pics that I went ahead and bought it.  The pictures are definitely not better than my iPhone.  The pics were often blurry, especially if there was any motion going on when I took the pics.  Since I have three children, that's definitely not going to work for me.I suppose I should make the disclaimer that I didn't read the manual, so maybe I needed to use some different settings other than the auto to get better action shots, but after seeing how the pics turned out even when relatively still (and experiencing the poor re-take speed), I just didn't want to take time to go through the manual when I knew this one wasn't going to cut it for me.  I need a camera that takes good pics in auto mode so I can take pics of my kids when the moment strikes and not worry about changing the settings first.The re-take speed is very slow.  My Canon PowerShot is about 6 years old, with less optical zoom and fewer megapixels than this Sony, yet before the recent focusing problem happened, it took FAR superior pictures with a much faster re-take speed.

It is, however, good for its price and very good in certain areas.My point of comparison is the Canon PowerShot SD780 IS Digital Elph... that's my current regular point-and-shoot camera, and it's excellent. However, its three times the price of this camera.So let me tell you what this camera does well, and what it doesn't do well:GOOD-It takes very nice outdoor shots.-Video quality is reasonably good. It's not perfectly sharp, but if you're looking to take video clips for YouTube, Facebook, etc., then you'll do just fine with this.-Intuitive design.-Very lightweight and thin, easy to carry around.-Some indoor shots come out well... if the subject is standing still and the lighting is good.-A nice \"my first real camera\" for kids-- much better photo quality than the kiddie cameras on the market, and not as expensive as comparable regular cameras. Great if you have a kiddo who's interested in taking nature photos.MEDIOCRE-Despite that I see other reviewers complaining about this, I wasn't particularly bothered by the time between shots. Yes, you have to wait a few seconds, but that's how it is with all the point-and-shoots I've owned.-I can't imagine why you'd ever want to \"widen someone's eyes\" or perform other odd editing tasks on the low-res little camera screen.BAD-It doesn't handle motion well. I tried to take several indoor photos of my 6-year-old daughter, who, like many 6-year-olds, doesn't stand still particularly well. My PowerShot can handle that; this camera pretty much threw its arms in the air and ran around in circles screaming, \"I HAVE NO IDEA WHAT TO DO!\" My daughter is a blurry streak in every photo. So I wouldn't choose this on purpose if your main goal is to take indoor pics of young kids.-The flash mostly lights people up like their faces are made of Christmas lights. It was extremely difficult to get a decent indoor portrait at close ranges. When people stood back and stayed very still, I could usually get a good enough shot.-It doesn't come with a memory card, so you'll need to buy one right away. However, you can take just two or three photos using the camera's internal memory, which is pretty cool in case you're ever without a memory card and need to get one \"can't miss\" shot.-There's no separate battery charger-- you have to plug the whole camera in to charge it. That't not a huge deal except that it means you can't have a backup battery. I constantly rotate my batteries in my PowerShot... one's in the camera and one's on the charger at all times. I wish I could do that with this camera.**All in all, I'd consider this a good pick as an entry-level camera for people on a budget, or those who want a camera just for outdoor shots (maybe to take along on vacation or day trips).

It's 2.7\" LCD screen is very clear and bright, as I was able to see in bright sunlight with no problem.  The menu is simple with an AUTO setting, which will select the best scene mode for the shot you are taking.  The speed between when you push the button to take a picture and when the camera is ready to take another picture is a bit slow, about 4 seconds.  There is a continuous mode setting which allows you to take multiple exposures by just keeping the shutter button down.  I also tested the video setting and it yielding very smooth, clear HD video with sound recording and zoom capabilities.I loaded an 8gb SD card allowing some 1,100 plus images available using the full 16mp setting, which can be lowered to yield even more exposures.The startup from out of the box took about 3 minutes and it was ready to go.  I have several digital cameras and this little, pocket-sized camera certainly has it's place.  If you need a simple camera for a trip or event, and want a camera for under $100, this may be a good bet. I am giving it 4 stars for what it is, an inexpensive, versatile video and still camera which will take better pictures than your I-Phone or Android phone, and it's actually smaller and lighter than a phone. I didn't give it 5 stars because I felt the image quality wasn't 5 star.", "Date": "May 22, 2013"}, {"Title": "A Point-and-Shoot That Excels in its Price Range", "Author": "Debbie Lee Wesselmann", "ReviewID": "R2TDA7NYQ98DBL", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "The Sony Cybershot W710 is a perfect example of how the entry-level camera market has evolved to include some advanced features in an inexpensive housing. You can tell just by holding it that this is not one of Sony's better cameras; it has a lightweight plastic housing, and it lacks the sleekness of models that cost even a little bit more. I would even say that it looks and feels clunky. But it creates 16 megapixel images, has an easy-to-see 2.7 inch LCD screen, panorama capabilities, and enough settings to satisfy a casual snapshot user. Best of all, the Intelligent Auto is remarkably good and accurate. It quickly senses changing circumstances to calibrate the correct settings. For instance, if I take a photo of a room, then point it at a close object, the camera quickly switches to macro to be able to focus. My other entry level cameras (Olympus and Nikon, both a couple of years old) cannot handle macro focusing at all, and their auto modes are not nearly as agile and complete. The Sony detects a backlit subject and adjusts with a flash or an exposure change (depending on the amount of backlighting); the other two leave the foreground subject in darkness. I was amazed by the changes -- from portrait to landscape to night shot -- this camera senses and adjusts to in a matter of seconds.The photo quality is good. The write-time to the memory card is decent for the price point, a few seconds between shots. Using the flash, you have about 5-6 seconds in between shots while the flash recharges The continuous mode (good for catching moving subjects, although focusing can be an issue) will shorten the time period between shots (it's still not rapid fire, though), but it takes much longer to write to the memory card.The 5x optical zoom is adequate, although not surprisingly the lens doesn't let in enough light to make its use practical in dim conditions; the results are too grainy. For my own purposes, I prefer a minimum of 8x zoom for versatility when framing scenic landscapes, although if you take mostly snapshots of people, 5x zoom is probably enough. The camera also a video mode activated by a switch and a self-timer.The one huge drawback I've found is the flash: it seems to go off a split second before the image is captured, and that results in a lot of half-closed and closed eyes. I could not find a red-eye setting, so this split second may be Sony's attempt to build it into a single flash. If so, the result is disappointing.The camera comes with a rechargeable LiOn battery (good for about 200 or so shots), a USB cable, a wrist strap, and a wall charger. A memory card is not included. In addition to buying an SDHC card, you might want to purchase a spare battery.For a relatively inexpensive camera, this Sony performs well, especially for its price point. Will you get better photos and features if you bump up to a higher price? Absolutely. Among compact point-and-shoots, I prefer the even smaller but better constructed Sony Cyber-shot DSC-WX70 16.2 MP Digital Camera with 5x Optical Zoom and 3.0-inch LCD (Silver) (2012 Model) for just a little bit more; it has the same zoom and megapixels but in a sleek, metal case.

Amazon Vine provided the Sony DSC-W710/B 16 MP Digital Camera to try out. Overall, it's a good basic point-and-shoot at a reasonable price point.To be honest, I made my first mistake when it came to the battery. I put it in, but I couldn't get the camera to start up. I was convinced it was defective until I realized I had put it in upside down (contacts were to the left instead of the right). Once I figured that out (d'oh!), I was off and running.The Sony offers a large array of shooting options and special effect modes. The menu function is relatively easy to traverse, but you really need to take some time to check out each one so you know what can and can't be done. I question how useful some of them would be, as they wouldn't be options you could quickly set in order to capture a dynamically changing subject. For instance, the color saturation effect was fun (set one of four colors to appear, and the rest turn to black and white), but you'd have to think about the shot beforehand to make it work. It's most likely that you'll keep it in fully automatic mode and just click away.Probably the one thing that you *have* to be aware of when you get this is that there is virtually no memory built into the camera. Depending on the setting, you can get around four pictures with no SD/micro SD card. Basically, you have to plan that into your purchase at the same time you buy the camera (unless you already have a few lying around). It was somewhat like getting a new toy at Christmas but your parents forgot to buy batteries...Overall, I'm pretty happy with it. It's light enough to pack around on trips, and it does provide a few more options than I would have if I were only using my iPhone.

is easy to use-It comes with a battery (that is rechargeable and removable) and charger (I am NOT a fan of using AAA/AA batteries in cameras-It has a neat little \"panoramic scene\" mode that will let you use a tripod to get a very wide-angle view of something-It lets you take pictures even without a memory card (VERY nice, that is one of the things that bugs me about my Canon)My main complaint about the camera is that it feels cheap/\"plastic-y.\"  It is very light, and that bothers me, I don't like my electronics to be made chiefly out of plastic, especially handheld ones. I like them to have a bit of heft to them, and to feel solid.  I docked the camera 1.5 stars for that (although I rounded it back up to 4, because Amazon only does whole numbers). If that sort of thing doesn't bother you like it does me, then the only other negative for the camera is it only takes 720P video, not 1080P, which I consider to be standard now, and a bummer that it isn't included.So, overall, good camera.4 stars.", "Date": "June 25, 2013"}, {"Title": "Pretty", "Author": "Ingeborg Coffman", "ReviewID": "R25OC76HRO01T3", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "Love this camera, no disc needed to install into computer, no more unstable pictures, small, beautiful pictures, the camera thinks for you. especially at close ups, faces look great.", "Date": "May 21, 2013"}, {"Title": "Great camera", "Author": "mgreber", "ReviewID": "R2H2C786JK5XAD", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "The photos are so clear, and color is perfect.

It's been about five years since I've last used it, but the qualities from that camera have made their way to the DSC-W710, along with an upgrade in battery life, ease of use, and image quality.  It's a bit smaller than the older Cybershots, and the zoom, despite being higher, doesn't protrude as much from the camera. Other than the slimmer profile and increased resolution, there doesn't seem to be much that's new with the DSC-W710, except for the built in editing features. Software seems to be where Sony is trying to differentiate the Cybershot camera from a cell phone. The camera has something called \"Beauty Effects\" which allows you to do some limited editing directly from the camera, such as changing skin tones, smoothing out skin, eye widening, teeth whitening, and shine removal. The skin toning effect never looked good despite what I tried it on and the teeth whitening looked fake, but the skin smoothing effect works pretty well. Other than having a much ore powerful flash and the zoom lens, I can't think of too many instances where I would use the Cybershot over my Samsung Galaxy S4 camera.  When viewing the photos I took side by side, the differences were fairly hard to distinguish.  The Cybershot ultimately took the better pictures, but the convenience of having a camera that is almost as good built into my cell phone outweighed that.  Ultimately, I think the Cybershot might be a good choice for kids who don't have a cell phone yet and want to start taking pictures, or someone who doesn't have a cell phone with a higher quality camera built in, and doesn't need something as powerful as a more expensive camera with a larger lens.", "Date": "June 23, 2013"}, {"Title": "Good camera/ Boa Camera", "Author": "daniele antunes", "ReviewID": "RSUGBQHK5CM4P", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "Basic, but good.

Inside was an even tinier camera! It's barely bigger than a credit card and about the thickness of half a deck of playing cards. You also receive a usb cable, tiny battery and charger. The battery slots in easily and then you're run through the usual set up questions; date, format and camera settings. Then you're ready to take photos and videos.After set up, the camera boots almost instantly which is a refreshing change when compared to older point-and-shoot cameras, and naturally the pictures it takes are excellent as is the video. Now do keep in mind you should add a memory card or two when buying the camera as onboard memory is uselessly tiny. Just enough to get used to the camera's features but zero use for normal shoots.The panorama is a nice touch - click and pan slowly and you automatically have a panorama. Older cams I've had make you take multiple pictures then stitch them together - but not here.There's also several shoot modes as is expected in today's pas cameras.The optical zoom from macro to telephoto is excellent with the front lens moving appropriately as you zoom, no digital faux zoom here!So, a great little camera in a tiny package that takes great photos and video and is priced right.
