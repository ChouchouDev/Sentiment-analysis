Few days later, I bought the Sony A77 from them (Focus Camera) and it was like the same. They sold me a used camera for the price of a new camera! I wrote a review, but for some reason it's not there anymore...Joyce from Focus Camera called me and left a message saying \"call us back so we can see why you didn't like the camera.\" So I called and though they were going to say sorry for the inconvenience, send your camera back and we'll send you a new one, but what they said was \"the camera is new!\" I told them it was missing the golden sticker that all the new Sony DSLR's have and the plastic wrappers where missing for the USB cables and other things. She didn't give a F***!! She just said \"no no, it's new, good bye!\" Worst customer service every!I would avoid Focus Camera because of this crappy customer service and product quality! Selling used S***t for new!", "Date": "September 2, 2013"}, {"Title": "Image quality simply fantastic", "Author": "Cristian Fiedler Seebach \"C.Fiedler\"", "ReviewID": "R1AIEP2HGWJAJH", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "From day 1 I started enjoying this fantastic camera.
