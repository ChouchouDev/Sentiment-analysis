Most of them were really good so I decided to try it.16 megapixel and 24x optical zoom.Now I am not a camera expert, but I do feel like I can use a camera reasonably well and I am used to using different settings. I can use a camera beyond just point and shoot.The first pictures I took were in my livingroom. I wasn't impressed with the focus and lighting. So I tried using flash, no flash, indoor setting, auto setting . .  hmmmWell, it was time to go to my daughter's school concert. At the school the kids faces all turned out yellow, I had one picture turn out and I don't know why that one did. (I even brought it home and took the sd card out to look at it on my computer to see if it was just the camera display, nope the pics were terrible).Then I tried to video. The faces were yellow on the video too. But even worse than that, if that's possible, there is NO stabilization!!!!Also, when you zoom in and out it does not stay focused and has to re-adjust the focus constantly! So in the middle on the video there is blurry spots where the camera was refocusing. Sometimes school events are hard to take pictures at due to the lighting (it was in the gym & I was in the front row)So I tried again at home. I had my daughter stand by her granddad. He turned out clear her face was blurry. I manually adjusted the exposure and ISO bypassing all the presets. That sort of helped.I did not try the camera outdoors. I know some cameras that don't do well indoors do great outside.The next day I reset all the factory settings and tried one last time to take a picture in the kitchen of my daughter, it was so blurry. That was it, packed it up and took it back.", "Date": "April 25, 2013"}, {"Title": "Disappointing purchase", "Author": "MsKat", "ReviewID": "R2EESA4HDVH7D0", "Overall": "2.0", "Content": "Camera takes too long to focus on subject.

My wife bought this camera for me for my birthday, and it is a HUGE disappointment. As another reviewer mentioned, this camera feels like it would break at any moment...light weight plastic construction. When you move the camera in your hand, you can feel something inside the camera move. No joke! Maybe it's the battery? Don't know. But you can sure feel the movement inside whenever you move the camera. The zoom, while 24x is very nice, zooming in is a problem. When zooming on my model, the zoom continues to zoom, even when I've removed the finger from the zoom button! This is true only when zooming in; not zooming out. The result, I have to rezoom back out to get my photo. Very time consuming in the world of taking photos! Also, when zooming past 24x, this camera does not focus...it's very odd. Doesn't even attempt to focus. Not clear what's happening here. I took about 35 photos with the camera, but they are all oversaturated. They were taken out of doors. My cheaper $120 point-n-shoot took truer photos! A freelance graphic designer who occasionally takes photos, I can't use this camera at all. It would make me look cheap, stupid, unprofessional. I really can't express well my disappointment with this camera. Don't buy it. That's it. Just don't buy it.", "Date": "July 7, 2013"}, {"Title": "Easy to Use & geat Pictures.", "Author": "jrtalent \"jrtalent\"", "ReviewID": "RYSEU1XKMAL4G", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "There are a variety of settings to digitally alter pictures for fun.

Deister", "ReviewID": "R11CS9ZT9TISXP", "Overall": "1.0", "Content": "I've been using Olympus cameras for over 30 years and have the full range from film to SLRs. I bought this camera because I wanted a bit more zoom than my warhorse Stylus 810 has, so that I have a \"pocket\" camera to take into concerts. I knew that this wasn't going to be a good experience from the minute I took this camera out of the box. Rather than having something that FEELS solid, this feels cheap and is made of light weight plastic.Olympus removed some of the traditional settings, such as bird watching, so you have to fumble around to figure out what's what. But!! that's ONLY after you make your way through a maze of what's not identified as a menu--the actual menu also has removed traditional functionality that's on other models, so you have to figure out where they've put those functions, too!To have the untrained user have to set their own white balance? Very poor!The latch on the bottom where the battery and memory card are both in the same slot feels like it could break at any time.The battery charger is doomed to die as it's a USB cord that can plug into device that you plug into a wall--that same cord is what you'll also use to download pictures using their crappy software that doesn't recognize the device until you unplug and replug several times. These two should be separated for the sake of the USB will wear out and need to be replaced--I can see already that this will run a small fortune to replace from the way Olympus has been heading!The \"shooting screen\" is useless in the sun, even with sun glasses! (OLYMPUS BRING BACK Eye viewers! They are the ONLY way people can actually SEE what they're shooting!!! These screens are a joke!!)Don't even get me started on the software that comes with this! They're far more interested in getting you to race off to some online company to upload and buy your pictures than allowing you access to them and editing them!The quality of pictures is the real disappointment. This isn't what I expect from Olympus! There's are massive yellow and green tinges in the pictures, not the rich blues and reds that I've come to expect!This was $160 wasted. Since I can't return it, I'll probably donate it to Goodwill, as this camera is such a piece of junk I wouldn't want a friend or family member to own it!", "Date": "July 7, 2013"}, {"Title": "Very Disappointed", "Author": "Michael R McMahon", "ReviewID": "R2R3PPNQGLK274", "Overall": "2.0", "Content": "I had very high hopes for this camera based on my very positive experiences with two previous Olympus cameras, but in the end was very disappointed.  Auto focus was inconsistent leaving pictures without good definition.  Colors were washed out compared to scenes being photographed.  Video focus was constantly hunting, resulting in playback that was sometimes very sharp, and others almost unrecognizable.  It has lots of great functions for taking photos, but unfortunately, that functionality didn't result in good pictures on many occasions.  On the other hand, some pictures came out great and were real keepers, but the inconsistency drove me crazy.  I\u2019m not a professional photographer, but I do enjoy photography and have been engaged in the hobby for a long time.  This camera was not going to allow me to enjoy my avocation.

I have went from a 35mm, down to smaller and smaller digitals thru the years.  Decided that they have finally gotten the little ones as good as the SLR size.  No, it will not do everything but this little camera is a workhorse.  The pictures have been great even in low light (using flash of course).  The easy of use is marvelous.  And I just love, love, love, the \"magic\" function.  No yellow people as mentioned in one review I read.  But you can get them if you want.  There's an app for that.  LOL  Actually it's one of the magic functions.  I ran across it by accident.  The only bad thing is there is no viewfinder and the LCD is very washed out in direct sunlight but that is typical.
