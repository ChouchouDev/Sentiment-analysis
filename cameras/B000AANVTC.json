I bought this item with the expectation that I could link all my existing Panasonic ip cameras to this unit and record video from each feed to this \"camera server\" turns out that's not how this device works. This unit only supports up to a 1gb sd card (which would be okay I guess if we weren't living in 2011!) AND most importantly you can only record a single camera feed to this unit, don't expect to be able to record all your ip feeds to this single device.", "Date": "October 24, 2011"}], "ProductInfo": {"Price": null, "Features": null, "Name": null, "ImgURL": null, "ProductID": "B000AANVTC"}}
