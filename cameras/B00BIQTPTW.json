The delay in focusing is lengthly and the time from picture taking until viewing is lengthly.  Certainly does not allow quick next shots.  Have not seen how the stabilization platform is doing anything.  The instruction manual received is not easy reading.  Difficult to pull up the REAL manual and retain quick information.This camera works fine on still shots especially on the tripod, but, does not do will when trying to take picture of a moving grandchild, animals, people in action, etc.Sure glad my p200 still works, especially when using flash.Do not consider the W730 as a good investment when trying to improve my picture taking ability.", "Date": "January 1, 2014"}], "ProductInfo": {"Price": "Unavailable", "Features": "16.1 megapixel plus 8x optical zoom captures detailed subjects\nOptical SteadyShot Image stabilization with 2-way active mode\nCapture your videos in 720p HD Movie mode\nCreative shooting with Picture and Beauty effects\nAdvanced Flash illuminates distant subjects for beautifully lit photos", "Name": "SONY Cyber-shot DSC-W730 Compact Zoom Digital Camera in Silver + 16GB Secure Digital Memory Card + Sony Camera Case + Accessory Kit", "ImgURL": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/51SpLVCm1gL._SY300_.jpg", "ProductID": "B00BIQTPTW"}}
