It thinks for you, which makes it easy to operate. The nuances within the programs are easy to learn. The video camera is easy to operate, but be careful not to put your finger over the microphone. The flash works very well, and the indoor photographs are terrific!  Tons of pixels to work with, I love the big file photographs for cropping.The bundle worked beautifully, nice quality tripod, and the 16GB chip is plenty.", "Date": "July 20, 2013"}, {"Title": "great buy!", "Author": "Bcastillo", "ReviewID": "R3C41IZ8ZGH1MW", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "This us a nicer camera than I expected.  it was a Christmas  gift for my daughter to replace her stolen one.
