The only issue you might have is that it's rather large.Highly recommend.", "Date": "August 9, 2010"}, {"Title": "Best Camera I Have Ever Owned", "Author": "Jeffrey B. Naumann", "ReviewID": "R33VMGQKH08P95", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I have owned this camera since it first came out in 2001. It takes exceptional pictures for only 2.0 megapixels and the original lithium battery still holds a 114 minute charge just like it did 12 years ago. I wouldn't trade it for a 10 megapixel camera at less than half the price! It's that good. Get yourself a usb floppy drive for your computer and some cheap floppy disks and have a ball with it. Very high quality product, something you don't see much of anymore. Highly Recommended!!! Just bought another one yesterday. Thought I better grab another one before they are no longer available.", "Date": "July 30, 2013"}, {"Title": "Had this for years!", "Author": "R. M.

The only thing is there is no sound with the video/movie recordings, but the pictures are still awesome 7 years later!  People make fun of my big bulky camera but they are speechless when it comes to the camera.  I wouldnt change it for the world!", "Date": "March 7, 2008"}], "ProductInfo": {"Price": "$844.99", "Features": "Battery Charger (AC Adapter)\nRechargable Battery\nLens Cap\nShoulder Strap\nUSB Cable", "Name": "SONMVCFD200 Mavica\u00ae MVC-FD200 2.0 Megapixel Digital Camera", "ImgURL": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/41YFfy-iBPL._SY300_.jpg", "ProductID": "B000A6V3VY"}}
