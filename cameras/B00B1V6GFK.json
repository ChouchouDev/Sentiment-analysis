The camera bag isn't too bad but I was completely surprised when I opened the package and saw that it had a 32GB Sony memory card.  I was expecting a cheap memory card so I purchased 2x 16GB cards and didn't expect to use the card that came with it.  I won't bother reviewing the camera because there are a ton of other reviews that are more in-depth than anything that I could produce.", "Date": "February 28, 2014"}, {"Title": "Nikon D5200", "Author": "happy camper", "ReviewID": "R29E94FE0Q387M", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "Just learning how to use it.
