But, I really like my Coolpix L120 so I thought I'd take a chance on the L28 because I needed something really portable.  I made sure that I ordered a memory card that is rated at class 10.  The slower cards (class 4, etc) will take somewhat longer to snap and store a picture.  Wait times with my class 10 card are only about a second or 2 at most.  Pictures I've taken so far are reasonably sharp and colors are true.  My PC recognized the camera immediately without installing Nikon software and it was easy to move pictures onto my HD.  The high resolution of the L28 means pictures can be enlarged considerably.  For closeup I snapped a picture of a printed page at about 5 inches and the type was perfectly clear.  It is true that the L28 doesn't do as well in a dark room as my L120.  Pictures are a bit grainy, but normal room lighting produces good results.  In my opinion, for people who want a snapshot camera that is small and portable and reasonably priced, the Coolpix L28 is a good choice.", "Date": "May 29, 2013"}, {"Title": "Inexpensive and easy to use", "Author": "April Decker", "ReviewID": "RPZPQ5RNK1H4Q", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "This camera is really user friendly.

Towles", "ReviewID": "RBOXQ16RO5DQQ", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "Nikon COOLPIX L28 20.1 MP Digital Camera with 5x Zoom Lens and 3\" LCD or any small digital compact camera. I you want fast response time between your next shoot, you have to use very fast SDHC Class 10 UHS-1 Flash memory card 45/MB/s or 95MB/s. Normally this type of memory is used in DSLR cameras, but will work in any camera that can take SDHC memory card. I found this out about 6 years ago when taking pictures at a track event. I was missing getting the winner crossing the finish line, because of slow response using SDHC 10/MB/s memory. Another guy who was also taking pictures heard me complaining about missing the shots & told me about using 30/MB/s which was the fastest during that time. I later bought it & have been changing out my camera (for more megapixel & the faster memory every 3 to 3 years). With the faster memory you get one (1) second response time between your next shoot, instead of 6 to 8 seconds when using SDHC 10/MB/s memory card. I am currently using the SDHC Class 10 UHS-1 Flash memory card 95MB/s.You have to pay more than $10 or $15 for the fastest memory so that you get 1 second response time between shots.As of 08-14-2013 here are some Amazon price on the Fastest SDHC Class 10 UHS-1 flash memory cards for 45/MB/s or 95MB/s.SanDisk Extreme 16 GB SDHC Class 10 UHS-1 Flash Memory Card 45MB/s by Scan DiskPrice $16.82 & free shipping on orders over $25.00, List Price: $48.99SanDisk Extreme 32 GB SDHC Class 10 UHS-1 Flash Memory Card 45MB/s by Scan DiskPrice $27.99 & free shipping, List Price: $78.99SanDisk Extreme 64 GB SDXC Class 10 UHS-1 Flash Memory Card 45MB/s by Scan DiskPrice $57.99 & free shipping, List Price: $199.99SanDisk Extreme 128 GB SDXC Class 10 UHS-1 Flash Memory Card 45MB/s by Scan DiskPrice $123.99 & free shipping, List Price: $174.99SanDisk Extreme Pro 8 GB SDHC Class 10 UHS-1 Flash Memory Card 95MB/s by Scan DiskPrice $23.63 & free shipping on orders over $25.00, original List Price: $62.99SanDisk Extreme Pro 16 GB SDHC Class 10 UHS-1 Flash Memory Card 95MB/s by Scan DiskPrice $38.39 & free shipping, original List Price: $78.99SanDisk Extreme Pro 32 GB SDHC Class 10 UHS-1 Flash Memory Card 95MB/s by Scan DiskPrice $63.22 & frees shipping  Regular $199.00SanDisk Extreme Pro 64 GB SDXC Class 10 UHS-1 Flash Memory Card 95MB/s by Scan DiskPrice $132.52 & frees shipping  Regular $349.99", "Date": "August 14, 2013"}, {"Title": "Ok but picture not as Sharp as the Nikon L22 model", "Author": "Ltracer", "ReviewID": "R36O20D9Z9QXZA", "Overall": "3.0", "Content": "I bought this camera bcoz I loved the Nikon Coolpix L22 model I bought in Thailand & have used for 3 years with no problems except I dropped it & the battery door clip broke off so I had to get a #8 blk rubber washer to hold the battery door closed tight. I thought the L28 would be pretty much the same camera as L22 but was disappointed bcoz the pictures are not quite as sharp as the L22. I did some research & discovered the only real true different in the cameras of any concern is the pixel size being 2.4 \u00b5m\u00b2 for the L22 & 1.4 \u00b5m\u00b2 for the L28 (bare minimum huge difference!!) - u can find out all this infor on snapsort.com about any camera. Also the L22 was made in Japan & L28 is made in China (personally I really don't think that makes any difference bcoz these are cheap $100 cameras, period). All in All I like the L28 bcoz it is a little bit smaller (almost micro) than the L22 & I love little double AA battery pocket cameras. I took 10s of thousands of awesome photos in Thailand for the 3 years I was living there but had to keep the camera in the Auto Mode with the flash always on & everything else off such as motion control, etc., in order to achieve very sharp colorful pictures. When I was in Thailand I meet hundreds of people that had rechargeable lithium Li-ion battery pocket cameras & 9 times out of 10 their batteries were always low or exhausted so missed thousands of unbelievable shots - when my rechargeable NI_MH double AA batteries gave out I just hoped 20 feet over to the nearest 7-11 & bought some cheap double AA batteries & was back in business within 10 minutes for 200 to 300 or 400 hundred more shots - everybody always asked me to email my pics to them bcoz their cameras were useless (true story) - that's why I love double AA pocket cameras bcoz u never miss a good shot - just have to find one that takes sharp photos every shot...", "Date": "May 10, 2013"}, {"Title": "Returned it...", "Author": "JK", "ReviewID": "R2LGPJKAT1T13X", "Overall": "1.0", "Content": "I ordered this one straight away when my L18, which I loved, took a dive off the tripod.

I did everything from close up mode, to auto mode to various scene modes, even used the timer and not touching the camera, and using a tripod, to finally contacting Nikon tech service and asking 'what am I doing wrong', pictures are not sharp.

He bought it on the advice on a salesperson at Best Buy who said that the camera was very fast for a point and shoot.  I currently have a Casio point and shoot that has an enormously long delay and so was excited to have this new camera.  After using it several times, I have returned it.  The quality of the photos was just abysmal.The photos were blurry no matter which mode I was in.  The continual shooting feature did not work at all, in either the sport or pet mode.  I actually thought that the camera might have had factory defects, but after reading other comments here I have decided that it is just an awful camera.  I am now researching other cameras and have learned the hard way that you really do get what you pay for.  This may be okay for an amateur (as in a small child).  I'm no professional photographer by any means, and I do like a small point and shoot camera for convenience.  But it has to take good photos and this camera just doesn't.", "Date": "October 16, 2013"}, {"Title": "Good camera with marginal video", "Author": "Jim G \"Jim\"", "ReviewID": "R37H7JDQKOY441", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "For still pictures the camera is as good as one could expect. With the pictures set to only 2 megapixels the pictures seemed fine for everyday use. The camera menus and controls seemed intuitive and easy to use.For video purposes, it's great that the microphone is on the front of the camera for good audio pickup. However video quality seems only marginally acceptable. It uses an AVI format with motion jpeg, but the bitrate is relatively slow. Example: the Nikon using a class 10 memory card and 480p mode (720p capable) produces a 40 MB video that plays in 35 seconds (approx). By comparison an older Canon Powershot SD1100 IS, with a class 4 memory card and which also uses the AVI format, produces a 40 MB video that plays in 21 seconds. The Nikon video is blotchy and fuzzy by comparison to the Canon video. At 720p the Nikon video quality is still low, it simply occupies 1280 x 720 rather than 640 x 480 per frame. Thus the Nikon 720p video files are about 4 times the size of the 480p mode and have the same image quality. At least the Nikon has 720p at 30 frames per second rather than 25 frames per second as on some other cameras.Most video editors should handle the AVI video with no problem. Scaling the Nikon 1280 x 720 video frames to 16:9 DVD should have similar quality to a Canon 640 x 480 frame scaled to a 4:3 DVD.I would have preferred to edit with the 640 x 480 per frame video files (smaller, faster).For the price, the camera seems just fine for causal use. One star off for marginal video quality. For those that might prefer more video room in memory to video quality, you can give it 5 stars.See a 5 star review for the Nikon Coolpix L28 bundle I purchased from Amazon via Beach Camera: COOLPIX L28 20.1 MP 5x Zoom Digital Camera - Black with 16GB Memory Bundle.

I always read Amazon reviews, as well as Testfreak and DPReview.However, this afternoon I needed a camera with minutes to spare and I purchased a red Nikon Coolpix L28 whilst en-route to a construction site meeting.Obviously, a digital camera -- especially an inexpensive digital camera -- cannot be all things to all people. So be very careful before making a purchase if you would avoid buying a camera that will not suit your purposes.What are my purposes? I use small digital cameras of this sort for taking construction site photos and for use in appraisals and estimating, especially for walking through a site and documenting what needs to go into an estimate or proposal, and what has or has not been accomplished by subcontractors, punch list items, etc.Crucial camera features and behaviors for my use, with my 1-5 rating are:* Must use easily-obtainable AA Batteries  +++++* Relative low cost  +++++* Capture speed should be fairly fast  +++* Sharp photos with realistic color  ++++* Easy and quick menu and interface  +++++* Accessible buttons  +++++* Large LCD  +++++* Overall sturdy feel in hand  +++++* \u201cGripability\u201d (so I won't drop it)  ++Also very important is the ability to take legible photos in low light conditions such as attics, basements, under a porch, etc. (if using flash, photos should not be washed out).After a quick pit stop at my local computer store I raced to my destination, arriving on time. It was easy to load in batteries and card and figure out how to set the resolution to a fairly low 2 Megapixels (1600 x 1200).I shot 172 images in various lighting conditions from outside hazy to a dark basement. It's not wise to judge your results by viewing on camera because photos often look much better viewed on the PC. These did.I was able to hook up and download my photos with the USB cable that ships with the camera. I also removed the card and popped it into a card reader \u2013 the card-battery door is in a good, safe location and seems sturdy enough not to break if you are careful.Results: The overall quality of the photos was sufficient for my needs, especially most of the images captured in the dark basement with the small flash.The 3\u201d LCD is large enough that photos may be viewed on the camera and comprehended if you need to show someone immediately.However, overall image quality seems not quite as good as that of an earlier inexpensive Nikon Coolpix that I had used for the last five years (I'm unsure of model number, sorry). Images have a slight blurry feel and while the shots captured out of door's were pretty good, they could have been crisper.Capture speed, with a Kingston 8Gb SD4 card (recommended by the store salesman) rather lagged at times, but that only became a nuisance once or twice during the 172 image usage. I'll take the advice of a reviewer above and buy a 10 speed card.I would certainly NEVER shoot this camera without the wrist lanyard attached. The 3-D bump out over the battery compartment is smooth and slippery. Why couldn't a ridge or some friction bumps be included here? The supplied lanyard is not as substantial as I'd like; you'd think that the cord part could be at least as thick as a tennis shoe lace.Summarizing, this camera fits my needs very well, and for $89.00 I am happy  enough that I might buy it again. However, after viewing the resulting photos, I am a bit disappointed. Could Nikon could have given us fewer Megapixels in exchange for better image quality? Still, I only shot in Auto and Easy Auto mode this afternoon, and used the Flash on and off control as I needed it, so maybe experimentation with one of the other many modes will yield more pleasant results.All-in-all, this is a decent camera if it is what you need.

Mine looks identical to the one pictured above, an attractive sort of wine-red color. Full disclosure: I bought it from another online retailer. However, I really value Amazon's user reviews, so I thought I'd add mine to the mix. I bought the Coolpix L28 to replace my 10.1mp Canon A1000IS, which is about five years old now, and which has developed a lens error of some sort. Cheaper to replace than to fix, sadly. That was a surprisingly good little digicam.I find lots of uses for a pocketable, compact and lightweight digicam when I don't feel like pulling out my full DSLR rig. The Canon excelled at this, and I was hopeful that the NIkon would as well. In that respect, the results have been a mixed bag.Make no mistake about it -- the L28 is a digicam for the complete novice. In a novice's hands, it will do an acceptable job. Barely. The menu is easily accessible and is also easy for the novice to understand . . . I suspect. Being an experienced photographer for the past 35 years or so who has worked professionally, it is a bit hard for me to put myself in a novice's shoes. Nonetheless, I suspect it will be easy for a novice to understand and use, especially since it was clearly designed for this sort of application.The reason why I bought mine was because of its rather surprising resolution -- 20 megapixels. There are still quite a few pro-level cameras in use that do not have this level of resolution. So I was intrigued by this. What I discovered, however, was that this level of resolution is really only achieved under the most optimum of conditions. This is solely because Nikon chose to take the ability to set the ISO away from the user, and to automate it instead. To me, this was a huge mistake. Most all digicams like this have an \"Auto ISO\" feature, but they also allow the user to set the ISO as well. Not being allowed to set the ISO prevents me from setting it to its lowest number, which is ISO 100. Any setting above ISO 100, and I mean any, results in a noticeably degraded image. LOTS of noise is apparent by ISO 400. This is due entirely, I suspect, to the fact that Nikon has crammed so many megapixels onto its small, 1/2.3\" sensor -- the more mp a sensor contains, the noisier it tends to be. This one becomes so noisy that it is virtually unusable at settings of ISO 400 and higher. But unless the user is using this camera in bright daylight, the ISO set by the camera will be ISO 400 or higher, which means very noisy images.  Even when using a flash, I have found that, unless the subject is very close, the camera will bump up the ISO, resulting in even flash exposures of questionable quality.So pretty much as it sits, and under normal use, don't expect typically to get tack sharp enlargements beyond 4x6s or so. Even at web resolutions, I find the noise that results from just average photos to be unacceptable.  Under bright sun conditions, however, I will admit that the L28 does a very good job, resulting in tack-sharp 20 mp images that can easily be enlarged to 16 x 20 and beyond.  Yes, surprisingly enough, this camera's little zoom lens is good enough to handle 20 mp of resolution -- no mean feat.Another plus about this camera is it takes plain old \"AA\" alkalines and rechargeable AAs as well. I prefer compact digicams that take regular old batteries. Same as my dearly departed Canon A1000IS, the batteries are located under a cover on the bottom of the camera, and inside this cover is also where the SD memory card is located.The 5x optical zoom is adequate for most purposes. It has a digital zoom capability that adds another 4x on top of that. Surprisingly, the digital zoom on this camera is quite good. Most digital zooms are simply awful. Not this one. I found it to be quite useable in fact, with little, if any, image degradation. Which is remarkable.The specs claim that this camera has Electronic VR (Nikon's flavor of image stabilization), but I saw no evidence of it when using the camera without flash. And yes, I did have EVR set to \"Auto\" (accessible from the Menu button). There was no \"on\" selection. Images tended to be blurry even in an averagely lit indoor environment -- to test it, I chose a subject that was no more than three feet away from a 60 watt incandescent lamp. The image was noisy from being set to a higher ISO, but it also showed definite, unmistakable signs of camera shake. And I was intentionally holding the camera as still as I possibly could. My old Canon A1000IS would have easily passed this test.So this camera is really quite schizophrenic. Once you realize its quirks, however, it is possible to get good images with it, but only under a quite narrow range of conditions, all of which include lots and lots of light. And it is because of this that, despite its ease of use, its price, its high mp count, and the rest, I do not recommend it for a first time user because ultimately that person will be disappointed with the quality of the images. Bottom line: I am really very disappointed with Nikon for removing the manually set ISO feature from a camera like this, which produces so much noise above the minimum ISO that it has no business ever being set above ISO 100. I much prefer my old, dearly departed, Canon A1000IS, which had only 10.1 mp, but which allowed manually setting the ISO, and which, because of this, rendered images that were, on average, much sharper and cleaner than this Nikon does, even at twice the mp count.So, don't let the high megapixel count of this camera sway you into purchasing it. Consider its other features -- and liabilities as well -- before you pull the trigger.UPDATE: My L28 is about 8 months old now and the top button for the flash in the feature selection ring has stopped working in Auto mode (the standard operating mode). It still works in \"Easy Auto\" mode, though, which means it isn't a problem with the switch, but with the internals, possibly the operating system.", "Date": "December 13, 2013"}, {"Title": "Lots of options", "Author": "Melissa Carr \"Dog Mom\"", "ReviewID": "RWBBY1JIUJKNG", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I love this camera.

The camera did not work properly out of the box.  I contacted Amazon who paid to ship the faulty camera back and shipped a new one out immediately.  Great job Amazon.As for the camera, I am a huge Nikon fan.  I purchased this camera for work and taking head shots of staff.  It didn't need to be fancy and do too many things.  The feel of the camera out of the box is cheap, sorry Nikon, but it feels cheap.  The screen is big enough but is grainy.  The shutter cover does not have a great fit and seems to hang up when opening and closing (turning the camera on or off).After receiving the new camera it appears to take clear photographs and does what Nikon advertised it to be.  I would have definately thought twice about buying this particular camera for home use especially if I was able to go hands on with this camera.  I have used other cameras from other brands in this same price point and think there are better values out there to be had.Over all I am satisfied with the purchase.

The camera was not dropped or anything, so I can't even tell when it might have happened--apparently I must have picked it up wrong at some point carrying it around.  Reading online, I apparently am far from the only owner who has had this happen.  Going online to look at repair options suggests they want me to pay more than I originally paid for the camera to get it repaired despite the fact it is under warranty.Also, if you use Adobe Premiere Elements for video editting, it is very difficult to get the videos and photos into Elements.In general, I found this camera much less easy to use than my trusty Sony Cyber-shot DSC-H55 which has been around the world, including to Antarctica and back, for several years and continues to go strong.

I like not having to carry along a charger and being stuck if the camera unexpectedly needs to be recharged.  The batteries last a long time, even when using the flash.
