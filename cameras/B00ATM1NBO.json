{"Reviews": [{"Title": "Great value for an underwater camera!", "Author": "Eric Slay", "ReviewID": "R1N8IBJWTL1UYV", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "It's a great time to be in the market for underwater cameras. Because so many people have good cell phone cameras, camera manufacturers have had to step up their game and offer point-and-shoots with more functionality than the phones that everybody already has in their pockets. Underwater/shock-proof/dust-proof/freeze-proof cameras are for those times when we're having fun in environments that would typically ruin a regular camera or phone.Here's what I like about this camera in general:1. You can take it in the pool. Last summer, some of my best shots were of my kids underwater in our swimming pool. We have so many great memories of our pool, but until we got an underwater camera, we didn't have these captured. Another thing that we've really enjoyed is the ability to take video underwater. For fun, I get in the pool, have the kids dive in and then swim up to me while I video the whole thing. There's something really amazing about starting a video above the water with all the sound and water reflections and then going under when they break through the water and hear the muted underwater sounds as they swim up to me. More importantly, the smiles on their faces are bigger/more authentic than when we're just standing in the back yard and I ask them to smile.2. You can bring it to the beach and just throw it in the sand. When my kids are at the beach, we like to build huge sand castles. In the past I have brought my non-sandproof camera and spent most of the time a)protecting the camera from flying sand; and b)getting angry with my kids for flinging the sand in the direction of the camera. Now, I actually get in the line-of-fire as they're digging because the flying sand in the foreground makes for some great pictures.To sum it up, the best camera for the job is always the one you have with you. If you're scared your camera is going to get wet, sandy, or freeze, you'll leave it at home where it won't do you any good. With this Fujifilm FinePix XP60, you'll have *no worries*---As far as this type of rugged camera goes, I have owned Canons, Nikons, and Olymupus' offerings. Currently, my favorite of all is the Olympus TG-1iHS 12 MP Waterproof Digital Camera with 4x Optical Zoom  (you can see my review there as well) (*also note there is also a new model for this, which is here: Olympus Stylus TG-2 iHS Digital Camera with 4x Optical Zoom and 3-Inch LCD (Red))This Fuji proudly sits in second place in my opinion. That being said, it is also nearly $200 less than my beloved Olympus, so it is definitely a great value.Here's some specifics:The camera is built well. It's sturdy and has a solid feel. BUT, the biggest selling point for it's build-quality may be it's biggest problem for some: it's pretty small - like the size of two iPhones pressed together. This is great because you can just throw it in your pocket or purse and it won't take up much room. The problem this presents is that the buttons on it are pretty small, which will mean you might press the wrong buttons once in a while, especially when using it underwater. I'm an average size guy and it didn't offer me too much trouble, but if you're larger-than-average, you might want to look elsewhere.The photo quality is great. The pictures look good in and out of the water. Because I only use it for messy, sandy, watery situations, I can't report on how good it does indoors or in extreme low-light situations.There are a ton of features, and many of them are useful. In fact, it shares many of the features with the Fujifilm X20 Silver 12 Digital Camera with 2.8-Inch LCD (Silver). If you check my review there, you'll see that I love:SR is an advance auto mode that determines the best settings based on the scene. It even shows its predictions, so you can see if it is accurately assessing the situation. From my experience, it's startlingly accurate. It chooses from: landscape, night, tripod, beach, sunset, snow, sky, greenery, and sky & greenery. Having these settings on a camera is old news, but having the camera predict the scene itself and do so with great accuracy is a pretty exciting advancement.Also, there is a NATURAL setting which I love. What it does is takes one picture with flash and one without continuously and then let's you decide later which worked best in the situtation. Being a pro photographer, I am usually pretty good at choosing, but this is really helpful to my wife. Let me give you an example: If you're taking pictures in a darkened room of your child blowing out their birthday candles, your camera is going to choose flash to lighten things up. The problem with this is that it kills all the beautiful candle light. Using the natural-mode on the camera will give you both. It's actually a great learning tool.As far as video quality goes, this camera does a great job with that as well. Don't expect it to look like and HD movie you've rented from Nexflix, but you can expect it to capture great detail that your phone just can't see.--In conclusion, I think this is an excellent choice for a rugged underwater camera. Buying this (or another model) to capture the fun you have this summer is a no-brainer. The pictures you get will be priceless before you know it....If you found this review helpful, let me know! If there are any questions you'd like answered, I'll do my best to help.

I came to the conclusion that this is the best camera for the price.  PEOPLE,..its an underwater camera,..not a $400 SLR professional camera. ITS best pics are outside and underwater. Expect good pictures at night with the flash at about 10ft of distance,..nothing more. But if I wanted this,..I would not have been using an underwater camera..... HELLO ???My galaxy S3 phone takes great HD pics and video so I am comparing this review using my phone and the camera. I have an underwater case for my phone and the pics and video are truly HD and awesome. So this little camera had its work cut out for it since I bought it. I thought there would be now way that it could come close to my phone pics and video. I was wrong !PICTURES: Great high resolution pics even with an 8GB class 4 SDHC card, above and under the water. Love the fact you can take video and shoot pics at the same time. Screen brightness blows my phone away. I can barely see my phone under direct sunlight, but this camera has great brightness and can easily be seen under direct sunlight. Love the burst shot mode ! !VIDEOS...........VERY IMPORTANT......YOU NEED A CLASS 10 SD CARD TO RECORD HD 1080I VIDEOS. I bought my camera as a bundle at COSTCO which brought me the 8GB SDHC card CLASS 4. DO NOT USE THIS CARD FOR YOUR VIDEOS. A CLASS 4 CARD DOES NOT SUPPORT 1080I VIDEO WELL. IT WILL RECORD IT BUT THE QUALITY WILL REALLY LACK. TRUST ME.  I have tried it with both the class 4 and the class 10 cards. Also,..I did research on these cards. The class 10 records perfect 1080i video like my galaxy S3. Some people don't know this and notice that their videos are not great. Its not the camera,..its the card !So many features that I have yet to learn on this camera. This camera does some things that my Nikon L820 doesn't do. The floating strap is a must if your planning to take it in the ocean. It holds the camera and does not let it sink. Over all. I definitely recommend this camera. I do strongly suggest you buy an external battery charger on ebay or amazon so that you can charge your battery outside the camera. While charging the battery you have to use the provided USB charge cable which means you have to open the battery door and leave it dangling while the battery charges in the camera. This leaves the battery door at somewhat of a dangerous open position and subject to breaking. Overall, this camera does what its supposed to do. Period !", "Date": "August 5, 2013"}, {"Title": "Great camera. With Limitations.", "Author": "Otaku Guru", "ReviewID": "RQLOPR4MXXFI", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "I have a problem. I buy cameras like every year to every other year. I do have valid reasons for upgrading. Trying to find the perfect camera for the use. For me, this is my cruising camera. I needed something that can go deeper. That I can use on a boss excursions (think a scooter and sub combined), snorkling, and free diving while under water. I need an underwater camera that can take great underwater pictures and video and not have it look all green or blurry. I needed something with an optical zoom rather than digital only. I got this little baby on ebay for $140 with case, underwater strap, and a 8gb sd card. For the price I paid it is worth it. This camera is neat, but there are some minor flaws as well as pluses. I still think you can do better on underwater cameras, but even the nikon aw100 that is similar priced has nearly the same flaws. I think it has more to do with limitations with it being an underwater camera and the glass they use.This camera is waterproof. It goes down to 20 feet. Although their are cameras that go deeper, why spend $300 on one. Even the ones that go 30-36 feet are not universal. I almost bought one since I like to scuba dive, but that's rare and only on select cruises since I am not certified. Scuba diving you will go 30-60 feet underwater with a discover class. If you go deeper than 30 feet you risk your camera. Why get a $300 camera when it may not even work for basic scuba diving. I know the depth varies on where you go, but it helped know that the $300 still may not be able to go that deep for scuba. Boss you go down about 12 feet and this camera can easily do that. It is about 8 feet to the top of the helmet. I haven't tested this camera in deep water. Just the bath tub. It stayed sealed and the pictures were pretty good for underwater, but that's not a great test. I know from the videos on youtube with the xp50 the underwater pictures and video are superb. They rank right next to $300 underwater cameras. For me, this is an underwater and on water use camera only.This camera has some great pictures modes like 3d, panorama, selective color, underwater, landscape, etc. The auto in general is great, but you will need to go to picture mode underwater for the best under water pics. I talked with fuji about that since I was going to try staying in auto on trips.One thing I like about this camera is like my slr, you can snap pictures while recording video. Great for family functions. Just know you will hear clicks on the video from the shutter.I have a caribbean cruise coming in March. I wanted to use this on the trip exclusively since most of the excursions are on or around water. Problem is, the picture quality is somewhat lacking. Not awful. When you zoom in on the pictures they get fuzzy really quick. The picture quality zoomed in is the worst I've seen on any of my recent cameras in the past 5 years. The good news is this is a 16mp camera so unless you are making a movie size poster, when will stretch it past 100%? I messed with settings and if you lower the picture quality to 12mp or 14mp the picture quality greatly improves. You still get big pictures, but zooming in they look better by shrinking them slightly. I guess the sensor they used is not ready for prime time. Or better yet, maybe a firmware update will fix it. Within the settings you want to change your pictures to \"fine\" instead of the default standard. It gives a little more detail. Because of the picture quality, I'm going to use my budget pocket point and shoot. That way my slr is safe on the waves and only break out the xp60 for in the water pictures. Also, because of the picture quality issue, make sure you zoom in while taking pictures rather than trying to edit them on your computer. That way you get the best pictures. I'm not saying the pictures are that bad. Without being resized they look great. Let's say you want an 8x10. That is shrinking the image by a good half. When you shrink down the image while printing you get just as good if not better picture quality. For most people that's great. Just if you don't plan ahead on what you will print and use something like photoshop to zoom in you start to see a bit a blurring at around 120%. Unless you use photoshop or need to blow up a small 1/8th chuck of your photo you will never have a problem. This camera doesn't do great in low light. It loses a lot of detail. Avoid using at night in the house or when there's not a lot of light in the room. Outdoors it is great though.This is a really snappy camera and fun to use. Underwater this camera is the bomb. I love how the latch clicks into place and you should be sealed against water. Just watch the strap doesn't keep the door unlocked. Be careful handing this to others while in water. That latch looks like a camera knob and the last thing you want is someone popping out your battery under water and frying the camera. The latch has to be turned and the middle button pushed in to unlock it, so it does make it harder to accidently open the camera. For kids, this is a great and versatile camera. However, if you are cruising you are better off using a point and shoot as much as you can and using this camera where it is risky like around water. Even a nice underwater camera like from Nikon has image quality issues when zoomed in. I think it has a lot to do with the glass they use to protect the lenses. For 95% of the people out there you won't blow up the images before you print. With it being able to handle 16mp or even with my recommended 14mp to address picture quality issues you have more than enough mp to print what you need. In the end this is the best budget underwater camera I've found. Awesome snorkeling pictures and video. Land pictures are very good, but know you are limited in zoom.Personally, I would only recommend this camera for kids that need a camera that can take a beating or using this around extreme outdoors. For general indoor and sight seeing by land you want to keep your existing camera that probably has better zoom, better in low light, and hopefully better picture quality when blown up on the computer.", "Date": "April 22, 2013"}, {"Title": "Leaked on vacation", "Author": "ts", "ReviewID": "ROTFLSIGG7FOZ", "Overall": "2.0", "Content": "Ordered camera for a trip to Mexico. Received a few days before and used to photograph some of the flooding here in CO (in the rain), and on a quick hiking trip in the mountains (dry). Was happy with the picture quality. To get clear/well lit photos just play with the pre-set modes until you've learned what is best for different situations. On the trip I was generally happy with the photo quality- the LCD screen was hard to see underwater, and it had a hard time in low lit situations, but overall good enough considering how much fun it was to use it on the beach.  The camera seemed to be doing fine and I was meticulously following the instructions in the manual after every ocean or pool use (rinsing, soaking, drying, etc). However, on day 3 of my vacation I took it snorkeling. When I came out, it would not turn on. I rinsed, dried, etc. when i got back to my room. The lens, LCD screen, and flash all fogged up. I let it dry according to directions. Nothing. Even when returning to dry, not-humid CO the camera never would dry out/work again or charge. Very disappointing as i was only halfway through my trip. If you plan on using this in the rain, want something that can survive an accidental dunking, or wade on the beach (but not swim) this camera would probably be fine. If you plan on submerging it I would not recommend. Returned mine yesterday and will look at other brands.", "Date": "October 2, 2013"}, {"Title": "Considering the price I'm very happy.", "Author": "J. Donaldson \"Cal-diver\"", "ReviewID": "R2EGTRABVA99GT", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "August 22, 2013 UpdateWe are having a lot of fun with the XP60. We take it on the boat, to the beach, in the spa, and the local city pool. It's just great to put the floating wrist strap on my, or my grandson's, wrist and snap away when we feel the desire. I don't have to worry about bumping it, or getting it wet.As long as I keep the camera locked on ISO 100 we do get some decent photos. I also have taken some reasonable video. This one is jerky because I was driving a jet ski with one hand and taking the video with my left hand. [...]June 18, 2013 UpdateWe've now used this little camera extensively since it arrived. We've taken perhaps 500 photos with it. Here are my recent observations.The photo quality is not the best and the camera sometimes makes poor exposure decisions. Many photos come out of focus. Some of this is operator error, especially the focus issues. There is quite a lag between pushing the shutter button and the photo being captured so it is easy to push the button then lower the camera before the shot is capturee. Even with the ISO fixed at 100 the image quality isn't really great.I would say about 95% of the photos are properly exposed, and 75% are in focus.All of these comments must be taken in the context that I am a photo enthusiast and I usually am using a $650 camera body with an $850 lens. With that camera rarely is a shot out of focus and almost never improperly exposed. Of course the image quality from the DSLR is exceptional. The DSLR also has near zero shutter delay.On the other hand...I really like that this camera is hardy and waterproof. For the first time I was able to take a camera on the tow tube and take photos of the boat from there. It is so nice to hand the camera to anyone and ask them to take shots or video. I'm quite at ease having it move from place to place on the boat and not worry that it is going to get damaged.One of the big benefits is my three-year-old grandson likes using it and I'm happy to let him. 98% of his shots are trash but the other 2% are worthy of posting. As someone on Facebook said they are finally able to see me in photos.I no longer have to worry about using my iPod Touch on the boat, or don't have to bring the expensive DSLR along on the boat either.In the right conditions the camera does spit out some good photos, most are worthy of posting online which is my main use for photos most times. Videos are not bad either.Would I recommend this camera? Yes with the understanding that it is inexpensive and the waterproof feature is the biggest benefit.I have two other inexpensive (but more expensive than the XP60) and I spent some time comparing the image quality of those two cameras against the XP60.Sony W50 6MP camera (not waterproof) images were of lower quality than this XP60. This made me feel like I'd made the correct decision because with a waterproof housing the Sony W50 has been my on water camera for several years.Sone w150 8.1MP camera (not waterproof) images were almost identical to the XP60.Original ReviewI have a consumer level DSLR for great photos. I needed something for the boat/jet ski. I'm not always comfortable with the DSLR on the boat. This one fills the bill.I have to put all of my comments in the context that this camera costs about 1/10th the price of my DSLR. Obviously there is no way the photo quality, low light capability, or sharpness can match an expensive DSLR with a great lens. But for a waterproof point-n-shoot under $200 this is a pretty good camera.Pros:- Small and pocketable- Rugged to 5 foot drop, I can hand this one to my 3-year-old grandson.- Waterproof to 20 feet.- 5X zoom, one of the main things that attracted me to this camera.- Pretty good image quality for outdoor shots (considering it is an inexpensive point-n-shoot)- Zoom during video - there are many cameras on the market that can't do this trick- Auto focus during video - there are many cameras on the market, including a whole bunch of very expensive DSLRs that can't do this.- Quiet zoom so you don't hear it on the videos- Take snapshots during video - very cool feature that I wish was available on my DSLR.- Good menu system- Dedicated video button- 10 frames per second (up to 10 max)- 1080i video at 60 frames per second- Totally internal zoom. Nothing protrudes from the camera body.- Can use the camera while it is plugged into AC or another power source. (I have an external USB battery pack that can charge/power the camera)- Too many other features to mention in detail here here. I mean really, face detection, several movie modes, several shooting modes, numerous scene modes (sports, low light, HDR, portrait, landscape, filters, panorama, night, and more), Auto ISO ranges, various image sizes, white balance options, continuous shooting, shutter volume, exposure compensation, self timer, etc.- The front glass that covers the lens resists water droplets. Very cool.- AF illuminator to focus in the dark.- Uses a standard USB cable to charge.- The AF Illuminator lamp doubles as a charge lamp.- Micro HDMI connector- Printed help manual included- CD full help manual includedCons:- Some grain even at 100 ISO but outdoor shots don't show it until you crop 100%- More grain than you'd like at higher ISO- Not so good low light capability- Wrist strap slide/keeper slides too easily- Battery can be inserted backwards - dumb design fault.- No viewfinder. I said I wouldn't buy a camera without a viewfinder but this was just too good and cheap to pass up. I still think it needs a viewfinder for bright sunlight situations.- Snapshots during video are not the best quality- I wish the lens was in the middle of the face of the camera. It's too easy to get fingers in the photos (much like my iPod Touch)- No smile shutter option, but I've never used that feature on my other cameras anyway.- The \"standard\" USB cable is a type with a very small connector on the camera end. None of the dozens of USB cables I already have would fit.- No external battery charger supplied but for this price I didn't expect one. I ordered the $19.99 Wasabi Power charger with 2 extra batteries on Amazon.- Clunky manual 3D images - but I don't care because I'm not a 3D proponent.I will post a few photos I took today.I did take the camera into the spa this afternoon. I didn't let it stay underwater too long because I was afraid it might overheat. It worked great in both single photo mode and in video mode. It was great to play with the camera, look it over, and check all the menu options, without worrying that it was getting wet. I won't be using this at 20' depths but it will certainly get wet on our boat or jet ski.I did not buy this camera from Amazon, my favorite store, it was on sale elsewhere.", "Date": "June 13, 2013"}, {"Title": "Don't Buy a Fujifilm Camera!", "Author": "Lloy A.

They informed me that my warranty was void because of damage to the USB port.  First of all, the USB port works just fine, short of pouring glue in it, I wouldn't know how to damage it even if I wanted to.  After arguing with their customer support several times about why they were refusing to fix a defect (this was not damage, it was present from the moment I opened the box), I finally gave up and returned it.

It is durable, waterproof to shallow depths, and takes excellent photos.The photos are excellent, particularly with the image stabilization.  Unlike so many others, you can actually zoom in on a subject without camera shake ruining most of the photos.  The burst mode works well too, though it takes a while to save afterward.  The panaramic option in burst is really cool, allowing you to easily take panaramic shots by sweeping accross a landscape while in burst mode.The video quality is surprisingly excellent as well, particularly the sound.  This camera could easily replace a mid-level camcorder for most uses.There is an option to sysc the camera to directly upload to your preferred social media, though I admit not trying this out as I have no desire to do upload photos that way.The camera is waterproof to 20 feet, which would be great for swimming pools and basic snorkeling, though I wouldnt recommend for SCUBA as that depth is too easily passed.  I have tested this in the pool and the river, it takes great photos and stays completely waterproof.Fujifilm claims the camera is shockproof to 5 feet, though I did not feel compelled to drop it from 5 feet to test this.

I worked in a photo lab, and I had many customers telling me that the quality of the pictures from their single-use camera was great. But it was not, not great compared to the picture you'd get from an average camera. But people were happy with them.For this camera and any other cameras, do a bit a research and google for reviews on specialized sites. You'll see some sample pictures. For the XP60, picture quality is poor, really. There is a lot of noise, even at ISO 100 and pictures are really lacking of details. Yes, it may not bother you when looking at a screen resolution, but you'll notice on prints, and if you crop the picture.[update]  I uploaded a customer image for this product showing a crop at 100% zoom: http://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-media/permalink/mo2WXJBWOTHMDHO/B00ATM1M92Do yourself a favor and compare the picture quality of the XP60 with other cameras. For instance google \"ephotozine xp60\" and you can see full size test images.The other big issue is the quality of the display. The resolution is significantly lower than other cameras. In 2013 a 2.7-inch LCD display with a resolution 230k dots is definitely a big disadvantages versus the competitors. Viewing angle is pretty bad as well. This means that underwater depending on the conditions, you can't really see what you're shooting. You need to be just in front of the display, if you're a little above, you won't see correctly the picture, and with the poor resolution, it doesn't help.Apart from these two issues (which for me were the reason why I returned it) the camera is nice. It's fast, you can quickly turn it the camera on and take a picture. Some camera have some delay that will make you miss pictures. I had no issues with water leaking or other water issues. I believe that Fuji have now a lot of experience in underwater cameras and if you're operating it correctly you won't have issues using it underwater.The video mode is nice (although I'm not the right person to judge video quality). An issue I found with Video is as soon as you zoom a little, it struggles a lot to find the focus.You you need to know about these two issues (picture quality and LCD quality) before making your choice. If that's not an issue for you that's a great camera. But for me picture quality is the most important thing about a camera, that's the reason why I put only two stars.For the same price range, have a look at the Olympus TG-620 Tough iHS Waterproof Digital Camera (Blue) with Case and Float Strap. Picture quality is night and day, the display is 3 inch and 460k dots. It's 12 megapixels. Believe it or not, on small cameras like this, it's better to have 12M than 16M because the sensor has more light sensibility and on these cameras, the real resolution bottleneck is the lens.Other options is looking at older version of the Fuji XP, cheaper, with less megapixels and better picture quality (especially the noise). You can get a GPS version for the same price (if it's useful for you).", "Date": "August 15, 2013"}, {"Title": "Junk Camera", "Author": "Jefferson Bagley", "ReviewID": "R3NS4PGAAP55JM", "Overall": "1.0", "Content": "Camera died after only 5 months.

Let me just say my SLR has me spoiled and this thing is not even in the same league as my $700 SLR, but that's ok.  I bought this because I wanted to take pictures in situations where using my SLR could be dangerous (rain, pool, beach, dirty environments) and wanted a smaller camera that I could fit in my pocket easily.  Having gone through multiple digital cameras due to water damage, dust, dirt, etc. I decided a waterproof one was needed.First the good, this camera is at home underwater, the pictures it takes are just amazing.  I've take it to the beach and on snorkeling trips and it constantly surprises me with the quality of the pictures.  It also takes really good pictures in daylight and/or in bright conditions it can almost match the quality I see in my SLR pics in these conditions.Now the bad, throw in shadows or a darker environment and this camera has no clue what to do.  Turning on face tracking seems to make it better but it doesn't fix it entirely.  I don't think the software in this camera is up to the task of recognizing the environmental conditions and adjusting the hardware accordingly.  Often times when taking pictures in medium to low light conditions I have to pick the scene selection manually and/or switch to plain auto mode to get a decent picture.Video on this camera is ok, I haven't played it on my digital TV yet so I couldn't comment on its quality yet.Overall if you want a tough little outdoor point and shoot, its a good camera.  It is not suited to all conditions and I wouldn't recommend getting this as your sole camera over a normal point and shoot.", "Date": "August 20, 2013"}, {"Title": "Rugged, User Friendly, High Resolution, Lousy Zoom", "Author": "Kyle Slayzar", "ReviewID": "R2EBNVKOUR663D", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "I do a lot of photography and video work whether it be making instructional videos for the class I teach online (US Military History) or just enjoy seeing what the world has to offer via vacationing.  I have a small fleet of cameras at my disposal including two GoPro Hero 2s, a Canon Vixia, an old Sony Cybershot we won't bring up again, and am thinking about getting a Canon DSLR for more professional shots albeit my skills being anything but.The only other thing I do not have is a single-shot ruggedized camera.  While I have my GoPros, I use them almost exclusively for mounting shots on anything that does not require an operator such as vehicles, helmets, and, in one instance, mounting them on the rifles of ND Guardsman.  I needed something for quick, single-shots on the go in environments that I wouldn't risk expensive cameras on, hence the need for something a little more ruggedized.When I had the opportunity to review the Fujifilm XP60, I already had some tasks in mind to try it out and, so far after almost a month of testing, it's still operating in new condition.The first test I put it through was working in the rain.  During the last month, here in Bismarck ND, it has been raining a LOT more than usual with the occasional thunderstorm.  I also have a North American Robin's Nest recently built above my home's gas fireplace exhaust.  Upon receiving the camera, the mother Robin had just laid her eggs and this gave me the perfect opportunity to track the progress of the nest from the laying of the eggs to birth, adolescence, and eventual departure from the nest.  In the rain, and sometimes the thunderstorms, I ventured outside, kept a safe distance from the nest as to not disturb the mother, lifted the camera above my head to get the lens at the perfect angle, and took shots of the nest.I am happy to say that I got some amazing pictures of the baby Robins from birth to their leaving the nest last week (after an unfortunate misunderstanding when my mother came over to see them and ignored my warnings to keep a few yards back and got dive-bombed), and the XP60 is still in great working condition.  To explain just how rainy it was, at one point we were under a severe thunderstorm warning and, despite that, I was out taking pictures of the mother Robin keeping the babies warm and, while I was soaking wet necessitating several beach towels be utilized to dry me off, the camera was equally soaked but remained operable.To test the picture quality I then had the pictures professionally printed (don't have a printer yet, at least, not a good one worthy of 16 mexapixel) and sent to my room mate's parents, who requested them during their stay here last month.  Even on 8 1/2 x 11 glossy prints none of us could tell a reasonable difference between mine and those of a 35mm print.The XP60 sports 16 megapixels and that is amazing, especially for those of us who thought 4.6 megapixels were amazing back in 2001 and had not bought a digital camera since 2008 (the evil Sony Cybershot that I still have).  I am not a professional photographer despite having some field experience (IE: filming US Army field training, mountain climbing, hiking on non-designated trails, etc.) so I cannot comment on the image quality of the XP60 versus say a higher end DSLR (which, I'm trying to get into) but I was deeply impressed with the overall picture quality of the XP60.  My family certainly appreciated the glossy prints of the Robin's nest I took and my Grandma is considering rendering them into watercolor format in her studio as she is a professional painter.However, even with the rugged durability and the fantastic picture quality, what really impressed me was the user-friendly interface.One test that I always employ to measure how user-friendly anything is that I hand them to the least technologically savvy person I know and have them conduct tasks with them without ANY instruction to see how long it takes them to figure it out.  Fortunately, as stated earlier, my room mate's parents were in town and, to illustrate their level of techophobia, his mother was still rocking a 14 year-old Nokia 3310 cellphone that was lauded for having \"rare\" features like the game Snake and a working calculator.  I remember having to explain what iTunes was (\"An evil program that will crush your soul but do it efficiently.\").  My room mate did not have a digital camera and asked to borrow my new XP60 so I tossed his mother the camera and asked her to turn it on and take a picture of me, then promptly delete it not to test her but because I'm as photogenic as Julia Robert's ex-husband.To my surprise, she was able to complete the task within two minutes.  Her biggest obstacle was finding the review button, but that took all of 30 seconds as she simply utilized Holmesian deduction in deducting what buttons were NOT the review button.  The button interface is easy enough to figure out and so is the actual software interface.  Imagine what we users could do if we utilized the nerd mantra of \"RTFM\" (\"Read The Flippin' Manual!\")!!My only complaint about the XP60 is the lacking zoom lens.  While it's 5x optical zoom is slightly larger than the industry average of 2-3x, it still makes the XP60 little more than an in-your-face or right-in-front camera.  However, after reading my comments on the XP60, it isn't designed for such medium to longer-range endeavors; it's an everyday camera intended for outdoor durability.  It's a summer camera designed for your average, everyday American, whose only camera experience ranges from children's parties to that summer road trip that turns out to be anything but enjoyable (\"Are we there yet?\").The XP60 will make a great addition to my fleet of cameras, especially as I prep for an anime convention this month in Minneapolis and will hand it off to my partner, who only takes pictures with his iPhone 4.

One needs to use the owner's manual on the FinePix CD to learn about the more advanced features.>No carrying case.  We had to purchase a neoprene waterproof case separately.>Shockproof rubber borders mainly around the LCD so that still leave some plastic case edges vulnerable to damage.>Very short USB-micro USB charging/data cable: only 23\".  Awkward when charging or transferring data.>Wall adapter only for the charging cable.  No battery wall charger included.>*NO SDHC memory card included in standard retail version!*. Fujifilm was kind enough to provide reviewers with a 4GB SDHC card, enough memory only for taking static pictures or very short duration/low res. videos.  We've immediately upgraded to a 32GB SDHC for taking more pics and videos.>LCD screen is still susceptible to scratches like all cameras so I applied a more water resistant clear screen protector that will stay in place.>Similar to most waterproof sports cameras by design, this XP60 doesn't have an automatic lens cover so the large front camera lens is susceptible to fingerprints, dusts, debris, and scratches.  *Camera lens must be cleaned off frequently for clear, bright pictures!*>Construction, materials (mostly plastic and rubberized plastic required for most waterproof cameras), and tactile feedback of the buttons don't feel as high quality as my Canon Powershots (mostly metal/alloy).>Pictures and videos are very nice and sharp but the colors somehow don't seem as \"natural\" as my Canon Powershot cameras.

Overall, I think this is a great camera.  I have bought several different digital cameras recently for family members (Sony Cybershot, Kodak EasyShare), even another rugged underwater camera for my young son (a Panasonic Lumix TS20).  This camera certainly compares favorably with all of them.The camera takes great quality photos.  It has a multitude of features and modes.  The menu is easy to navigate, easier than other digital cameras that I've had.  In particular, I used the burst mode to catch the kids in action or at least the exact moment when they are both looking at the camera and smiling at the same time and not distracted or fighting with each other.  Natural and With Flash Mode is useful too, taking 2 photos one after another, one with and one without flash, so you can select the best result in any particular situation.Video recording works great.  It operates using a separate, dedicated button so you don't have to go into the menu.  So you can take a photo, then push a button to record a short video, push the video button again to stop recording, and go right back to taking pictures.  I used this to great effect at my daughter's last softball game to take some still shots, and then get some videos of her at-bat and running the bases.A couple of modes that I played around with, but did not get good or expected results were the panorama and 3D mode.  With 3D mode, to be honest, I have no idea what I was doing or getting with that mode.  It probably is just me.  With panorama mode, you get the option of 120, 180, or 360 degrees.  On vacation at the beach I experimented with this mode, but even using 120 and 180 I could not get an accurate panoramic photo of the length of the beach.Can you actually use this camera underwater and get decent results?  Yes.  To prepare the camera for underwater use, simply check the seals on the battery door to make sure they are clean and in good shape.  Select the underwater shooting mode, and you are ready to shoot.  Within an hour of using underwater, rinse the camera off under running water or soak in a bowl of water for 10 minutes, then dry it off with a towel and let air dry for a little while.I actually was so pleased with the normal everyday performance of this camera that I really did not want to risk using it underwater in case it did not perform well and was damaged.  Fortunately, there have been no problems or leaks when used underwater.  We have used it twice at pools to take underwater photos with the kids, which was a lot of fun.

As a waterproof/shockproof camera, this camera is great value. You can take nice pictures or videos underwater. Few minor complains are that there is a fair amount of time lag between when you push the shutter button and when the camera actually capture the image. I see a fish in the center of LCD and press a shutter button. The fish is often out of flame in captured images, or you capture the tail of fish in the image. Also, the shutter speed is not fast that some images of fast moving fishes come blurry.

Taking it snorkeling was a big bonus.Starts up fast, pretty communicative, on screen help and such. Usually focuses fast. We liked all the colors it comes in. Panorama mode, HDR, image stabilization, the works. Inexpensive for the features.After a day at the beach, we had trouble opening the battery compartment because sand had gotten into the locking mechanism. Fortunately we had a safety pin at hand to clear out the sand otherwise we'd been unable to charge the battery.Pictures were really disappointing, low contrast, dull colors, often slightly blurry. It's about as good as the better phones. The closest camera to compare is the one we had three cameras ago, a $100 Canon A series. That Canon took much better pictures, even with a cheap third party waterproof housing. Currently our other camera is an S90. The S90 of course takes better pictures, but it also costs twice as much. Let's be realistic - a waterproof camera is a compromise. Moving parts (zoom) have to be internal and you probably only get a plastic, flat front lens. What's expected is a camera that reliably takes pictures for Facebook use where we can't take other cameras. Because, hey, if you have no camera with you because you are afraid it might get damaged, you get no pictures at all.In this light, this camera doesn't quite do the trick. Even for Facebook use, the pictures are very soft and visibly washed out. Taking pictures under water, a lot of shots were missed because the camera would not focus at all. when it did, most were a grey-brown blur. I realize underwater photography is tricky, and results can be mixed. But we've simply seen much better results from other cameras. My wife, who isn't a pixel peeper at all, didn't like the camera either and decided to return it.There is no orientation sensor, this means you can't upload pictures directly, you have to sort through them and manually rotate.

For the price of this lower end water proof camera, it had OK video and good photos.  After 2 different vacations in Jamaica it started to seep in water and died. Thankfully the SD card survived.On a snorkeling trip to Belize, I decided to upgrade and purchased a Panasonic Lumix and another Kodak Play Sport HD (2nd generation) for my wife.  The Play Sport took much better video and photos than the Lumix.  The Lumix photos were generally blurry and green.  In the water you are constantly moving with the waves and the Lumix had zero stability, thus the numerous blurry photos.  The Play Sport had better photos but the view screen was so scratched up by the end of the trip.  By the way, the Lumix had OK land photos and the Play Sport was horrible on land with no flash. (Play Sport was great with very bright sunlight land shots.)I upgraded to the Fuji, hoping this will be my last waterproof camera.  When I first played with the camera, it was in the evening hours and the metallic buttons made it difficult to determine what the button was for.  Using it in daytime, I was able to clearly see the pictures/letters on the buttons.  The camera has a pretty good locking mechanism for its battery and memory card slots so there is no fear of accidentally opening the chamber underwater (unlike the Play Sport).The Fuji is equipped with Optical Image Stabilization.  It holds up well to the waves of people jumping in and out of a pool with no burred shots. The HD video is sharp and clear.  There are plenty of options and special effects to choose from, like red eye reduction, timers, continuous shots, panoramic shots, options for moving objects, and even different filters.  There are also options for shooting on the beach, for photographs of sunsets, and low light.  The camera definitely had more bells and whistles than I expect to use, but it is nice to have.The Fuji camera is far superior than the other two cameras I purchased.  This camera quickly replaced my Fuji XF1 as my daily, go to camera.  The reason I gave it only 4 stars was due to the zoom.  I do not believe that the zoom will be powerful enough to get a close up of a fish hiding in coral on a snorkeling trip.

It takes beautiful pics with a depth of field that is perfect for me.In contrast to the others, this one was supplied with an internal battery charger (2-piece USB charger plug), which I don't prefer. Because of the water resistance, the plugs are inside the battery/card door, and I don't want to leave the door hanging open during charging. For another thing, using my old external chargers from the other cameras lets me have extra batteries charged and ready to go, so this is what I've chosen to do.I have no reason to be dunking this baby, so I'll leave it to other reviewers to tell you about the effectiveness of the water resistance; I'm too fond of it to risk it!!MOST highly recommended!9/12/13 I take tons of pictures now that I'm doing photobooks, and I'm just not satisfied with the flash on this camera.

none) of the pictures were in focus when using the camera's built-in automatic sensor mode.  For general one-shot-at-a-time pictures, when using the automatic sensor, wherein it is supposed to figure everything out for you and select appropriate setting in the moment, none of the shots were actually sharp...barely passable in some pictures!Video: This is where the camera is nearly worthless!  Took it on its first use to the river to capture family boating fun. I detected no image stabilization whatsoever in the videos taken; they were grainy and out of focus at many times.  Even more frustrating was that the camera seemed to change recording speeds during the same video sequence.  What I mean is the recording would be at real-time speed, and then appear to have processing difficulty that would eliminate frames (perhaps since it could not process fast enough) and make the video look out of sinc, like it was being recorded with a special effect...virtually never recorded a seamless video without problem.I will be returning to Costco if they will take it back without the packaging which I threw away.  I had a very old Kodak that got ruined when splashed at the river...it had maybe one-quarter the supposed processing power as this fuji, but it's videos were twice as good as the dismal stuff resulting from this finepix XP60...I think it's a big miss and cannot recommend at all!

She found it to be very easy to use and carry around with her. She really liked the flotation wristband while she was snorkeling. She wanted something that would get good pictures, be easy to carry and would work underwater.Looking at the pictures I thought they were good if not great - several times the camera was fooled on its exposure, and since the camera shoots in JPEG only it limits your ability to correct exposures afterwards. She said the camera focused very slowly. Any camera of this type will struggle with underwater photography because of its small lens and the relatively low-light nature of the environment - this camera had a little trouble with blur and focus underwater, but with some practice I think it could be very effective. To get more capability I think you'd have to spend a whole lot more.Overall I think this is a really good camera to carry around as a quick point and shoot with underwater capabilities. If the underwater features aren't important, I'd probably prefer a Canon or Nikon for their better photo quality.This product is or has...

I had some extra money to spend so I thought, why not? And ultimately, I'm glad I chose this camera!This camera takes really good quality pictures. I have a lot of stunning pictures that I've taken on my two grand adventures with the camera so far. Focusing is very easy as the shutter button has a very obvious halfway point. The only downside to this is that it's hard to tell whether a picture was fully in focus when it took until the picture was transferred to the computer. But other than that, this camera has a stunning picture quality...pretty amazing for such a small camera.One of the many strengths this camera has is the continuous picture mode. When this mode is switched on, you can take 10 continuous shots with one press of the shutter button (10 pictures per second). This mode is extremely useful and is extremely fun to use. I've used it numerous times as my siblings jump in the pool...I get to capture the jump, the falling, and the splash all in one continuous shot. I've also used it while taking pictures of campfires and you can get some pretty awesome fire pics with this mode.When I read that this camera can record videos in 1080p HD at 60fps, I didn't really believe it at first...until I tried it myself. It is AMAZING. The 60 frames-per-second really makes the videos feel more lifelike and it makes the experience of watching the videos much better.Perhaps the best thing about this camera is that it's waterproof. This was one of the main reasons why I bought this camera, as I wanted to get some awesome underwater pictures of my siblings while they were swimming in the pool. The waterproof feature works flawlessly and I love it so much. Recording videos underwater is amazing, too. It's awesome to record a video outside of the pool and then jump in while it's still recording. We've been working the waterproof feature to death and we love a lot of the pictures and videos we've taken so far.This camera has a very nice size...it fits into most pockets easily. It's about the size of an iPhone 4 only twice as thick. It's this thickness that may cause the camera to not fit in some pockets.All-in-all, I really enjoy this camera. It has awesome picture & video quality, and I really love the continuous shot and waterproof features.

I purchased this for my teenage son just before we went on a vacation to Costa Rica. The timing for this particular camera could not have been better.  While I was carefully removing my camera from the ziplock bag in the rainforest, my son was diving into a pristine waterfall and taking underwater photos through the crystal clear water of tiny fish.  My identically configured Fuji camera seemed suboptimal in comparison in so many ways.  It can rain anywhere, and this camera goes anywhere.  He also dropped it from horseback, naturally onto a rock, and it was fine - not a stratch.  It is so nice to have a camera that you do not have to worry about!The camera is simple to operate and takes great images.  The photos from the trip that we had blown up were all taken with this camera which outperformed my camera with identical features but which did not have the water and shock resistance.  Something else that I noticed is that direct connection image transfers were much faster from this camera than mine - also a Fugi 16 MP.The zoom feature is very good, and seems to take much better pictures from a distance.  His photos of monkeys in the trees were all very crisp and could be enlarged easily.

You'd be surprised how quickly the light falls off underwater. This camera makes a few improvements over the older XP50:* Stabilization system to assist in low light shots* Much less noticeable red shift* Improved image quality.One strange thing I noticed was the battery socket was not keyed, so you were able to put the battery in the wrong way-- so watch out for that.Overall, if you want to take pictures near or in water, this is a one of the most economical ways to do that.", "Date": "July 18, 2013"}, {"Title": "Underwater Camera", "Author": "D.

That requires a separate housing to keep the water out. If you can free dive deeper than 20 feet or so, consider the XP200.  It is rated for deeper depths than the XP60, but this one is fine for snorkeling along the surface with an occasional dip deeper.  I took it on a recent beach trip to Curacao and it met my expectations.  I didn't find a lot of difference in color rendition between the \"underwater\" recording mode and the surface modes but coloration can be corrected by computer processing.  At least this camera didn't leak and you're warned not to open the access door without drying the camera off. I followed the warning and had no problem.

Video was easy and clear and pictures were very  clear as well. I was a little skeptical of the claims and good reviews but  am pleased that this camera performs very well. I ordered a second battery and charger but the original battery seems to last at least for several hundred pictures all on large fine. The SR (scene recognition) setting seems to work very well . One needs to remember that the lens is near the upper left so fingers don't show up but otherwise it is very intuitive. I do prefer my Canon SX 10 IS digital for serious work as it allows for external flash, 20X magnification and more controllable and creative settings but on program the Canon and Fuji XP 60 on SR pictures seem about the same quality. My Grandson took it into the water but the water was so murky that the results were inconclusive. I plan on taking the  camera into a pool and seeing what the underwater setting will look like. I like the price, the compactness, the ease of use and the many settings that are possible with the Fuji.I should get a floating wrist strap as I worried about my Grandson losing the camera but he kept the included strap on and it worked. It came with a small camera case but I needed to have a bigger one to carry the charger and the battery as well as the camera. It is a Lowepro compact camera case and fits everything perfectly. The camera  also came with an 8gb SD card which surprised me. I downloaded the manual from Fuji's site and saved it to documents as the quick setup manual that comes with it is not the most complete.Overall I would recommend this camera to anyone needing a pretty durable, waterproof and sand proof camera so they could save the DSLR from sand and surf problems and still get very good pictures and HD video.", "Date": "August 22, 2013"}, {"Title": "Waterproof Digital Camera", "Author": "Gerry McD", "ReviewID": "RAZSWBKSTXHVE", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "I like the pictures it takes, but the instruction manual is a little weak and disorganized.

When I tried it indoors the movement was all out of focus.This camera has 23 shooting modes to choose from!

There is no dial on the outside of the camera to quickly change the shooting mode. It is done in the menu section.The picture quality of this camera is pretty good. I like that this camera is so durable.

It takes beautiful pictures, is compact, sturdy, and easy to use. It's great to be able to have a camera I can safely throw in my purse and take everywhere.It takes pictures faster and the flash resets much more quickly than on my old Nikon CoolPix. The battery life has been great. I've charged it once since I received it last month. Overall I couldn't be more pleased with it.The one negative thing I have to say about the camera is that some of the features and the menu weren't intuitive to use initially. There was a small learning curve, but if I had taken the time to read the manual I might've had an easier time. It may also be because my previous camera was a point-and-shoot Nikon which uses a slightly different menu structure than the Fujuifilm FinePix.When I was first setting up the camera the beeping every time I pushed a button was driving both my boyfriend and I crazy, however, I had a LOT of difficulty changing the key push to silent because I had first changed some other setting while taking some photos and didn't realize that once I put it on a specific mode I was unable to change some of the other settings. After ten minutes of frustration and frantically flipping through the relatively small but informative manual I was able to realize where I had gone wrong, but as a well-educated reasonably-intelligent individual I was aggravated that I had to resort to reading the manual. However, all that aside I really do like this camera and it's a great replacement for my old Nikon and it's so great to not worry about throwing it my purse and taking it to a ballgame or anywhere else.If the menu was slightly easier to navigate and I could have more easily figured how to change some of the settings I'd gladly give this camera five stars.", "Date": "June 27, 2013"}, {"Title": "Fantastic camera!", "Author": "D.

I sent the camera to the FujiFilm to be repaired under warranty.  They denied the warranty stating that the HDMI pins were bent.  We never used the HDMI port.  The camera charges from the USB port.  I contacted the repair center manager and never received a call back.  I have sent several e-mails asking for some assistance.  The only response I received was to contact the repair center to get our issue addressed.  This was the third FujiFilm camera we have purchased, but will probably never buy one again.UPDATE:  We finally got in touch with a manager at FujiFilm repair center.  He explained that it appears that my daughter may have put the plug in the wrong port to charge the camera (to her defense, the ports are almost identical looking).  This caused a pin in the HDMI port to break off and short out the camera destroying the board in the camera.  FujiFilm repair center agreed to reduce the repair cost and actually gave us a new camera and a battery charger we could plug in instead of directly charging the camera.  We are happy that they finally have addressed this and hope they change the design or provide a battery charger with future models.

There are a lot of imaging options, so if you take a few minutes getting to know the camera before jumping off the boat, it's a breeze to use. The battery life was very good.  I only charged it every other day or so, and that was just to make sure I would be ready to go.  I really like the closure to the battery compartment.  It's a little tricky to open/close the first time, but I felt very secure in that fact that the camera would remain leak-proof.

My daughter is anxious to take this to the pool and beach. But we tested it out today by using a plastic container filled with water and some sea shells and sea glass. It felt strange at first, purposely putting a camera in water. I kept feeling like I was going to ruin it, but of course, it is waterproof so it was fine. I posted some of the photos here, up above at the top of this amazon page.We took the pics in our carport, so it was shady, but still they came out pretty good. I have not edited these at all, but it would be easy to brighten them a little using Picasa (free download from the internet) or whatever photo editing program you like to use. For one picture I held the lense halfway above the water and halfway under the water. I went in and added a small red mark so you can see where the water line is. That might be a fun angle to use in some of the water pics this summer. The rest were taken with the camera completely submerged. We used the water setting (and there is even a macro/small-detail water setting, but we didn't need that). I am really happy with the way they came out. I was worried an underwater camera would show a lot of distortion and blur, but happily that was not the case.I also posted one picture of my chicken so you can see what regular, non-water photos come out like. My daughter took this one and said she just had it on the auto setting. I love how close up you can get yet it's still so clear and clean.My family and I are going to get a lot of use out of this camera!edit 8/3/2013: I took my daughter and her friend to the pool this weekend and we brought the camera. They had a blast! They took pics, but also made videos of each other jumping in, and swimming underwater. It was really neat to come home and look at the pictures and watch underwater videos. This is a lot of fun. If you like the pool or beach, this is a great camera for you. My favorite video was my daughter swimming in circles underwater around her friend, then popping up and seeing her friend above water. It reminded me of a shark's point of view, in a goofy way.

I even brought it to a local photo store and they said it does not look water damaged and there are no dents, so it is an electronics issue that would (hopefully) be fixed under warranty IF amazon.com would have kept track of serial numbers.

I do sure remember using film cameras that were disposable at the beach and during snorkeling trips.This camera is digital, and is able to be used in places we just might talk about at a fancy party.1.  What's in the box?:  You receive the camera (I received the blue version), a battery, a cord, a charger (with USB cord), and a instruction book with a CD manual.2.  Aesthetic:?  First off, the camera is a nice small size that is about the size of a palm for a larger person, or a entire hand for a child: the camera is not large.  The camera coated with some rubber like matierial on the sides and the back.  The lens is on the top right (facing you on the front), with various buttons on the top (including power) and a nice display with the expected buttons on the back next to the display.  On one side, there is a big button that rotates to securely hide the brains of the unit (picture card, etc).3.  Use:?  I am familiar with Fujifilm based on another excellent camera I tried some months ago.  I will say that this camera is not in the same universe as far as function.  That is, this camera is for taking pictures in a demanding environment and so film images are not going to be as high quality.  There is no practical zoom on the camera itself as the lens does not move.  You do get 5X zoom, but that is very limiting.  The power up is extremely quick on this camera, which is excellent.  there is also a appreciated 'burst' function that allows for quick  numbers of pictures during an action sequence, for example.  The functions are almost standard today in terms of the ability to display pictures, turn flash on and off and the like.  There are some neat features you can use for stringing together videos, plus functions for different locations which is a very nice feature.The pictures themselves are very nice with the 16MP camera.  For simple point and shoot, the camera takes nice pictures, and I wouldn't complain about quality for simple shots with little composition (in other words quick pictures at the beach, hiking , etc.)  As there is no real zoom, distance shots are not excellent and should not be expected.  Most of the shots should be close-in and not yards away for the best results.  The flash is not overwhelming, so night shots in lower lighting will not be excellent, but serviceable.  (Again, form over function is some cases with this camera).Waterproof?:  I have not tested this camera underwater - yet.  But, I have placed the camera underwater in a sink, and in the shower and the camera has not died.  In fact, the brains (the card port, USB port for charging, and the mini-HDMI for display) are under one opening door. This door has a clever button to push down to open and must be turned to open or close.  You hear a nice click when the door is secured. Also, if you examine the parts, you see a nice silicon seal that has a nice metal fork with puts pressure to seal the camera off from water.  Of course, water pressure will also help to seal off the camera.  It seems secure, and it is difficult for this to be opened accidentally.In short, I am impressed with this camera for what it is.  It will survive water and other bad actors and allow you to take some nice pictures (with the proviso above) as well as video for those trips during which taking your phone is just not the smart thing to do.I will update the review as I continue to mess with more functions of the camera and use it in more demanding circumstances.", "Date": "June 6, 2013"}, {"Title": "Fun camera", "Author": "Michelle Sachtjen", "ReviewID": "R1KHCEVS8AT5TX", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I love that it's water and drop proof!
