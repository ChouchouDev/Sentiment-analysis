{"Reviews": [{"Title": "Great camera!", "Author": "Victoria", "ReviewID": "R2IQSOJPGBI7RK", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I have 2 other Panasonic Lumix cameras and love them all.  They take great pictures.  I made this latest purchase for an upcoming trip.  It does a lot more than my TZ5 that I carry with me in my purse every day, though it was the only camera I took on a trip to Australia and I got wonderful photos!  I also have a DMC-G2K that I love, along with a variety of lenses for it, but it's more than I want to travel with.  I chose the FZ200 after talking with another traveller on vacation.  He said he hardly uses his Nikon anymore because this takes such great photos and the 24X zoom is all he needs.  Looking forward to trying out all the features, including panoramic and video.", "Date": "June 8, 2013"}], "ProductInfo": {"Price": null, "Features": null, "Name": null, "ImgURL": null, "ProductID": "B00BEJ6D2U"}}
