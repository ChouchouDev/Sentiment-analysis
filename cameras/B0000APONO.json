{"Reviews": [{"Title": "Great camera for starters and above", "Author": "j. woods \"akaal11\"", "ReviewID": "R3PR9XLUKNP2KX", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I wanted to get a camera that was good enough to keep up with technology for the next couple of years. I then came upon this camera.  It has 5 MP max resolution, but if you want to save space or you have a small card, it can be lowered all the way down to 1.2 megapixels.  The camera comes with 32 MB internal memory, which is very nice, like if you are on a trip and you card gets full, you can easily switch to internal.  I got this on Christmas, and it did not come with a memory card, and no stores were open.  But i was still able to tqake 16 5MP pictures.  The next day i went to target and got a 128 MB card for $60. (Not the best deal but i was anxious and had money to spend).  This camera uses Sd/MMC cards (secure digital/multimedia card).  the Kodak Dock is nice but it is not necessary, especially for its $80 price tag. Just but rechargeable batteries and charger for $20.  I would reccomend the Kodak Easyshare starter pack along with this.  It is $35, but it has bettery pack, charger, and a bag, and some other accesories.This is as of 12/25/03 (This exact product)IncludesUSB Cable (Kodak Easyshare Dock is nice but it is not necessary)Kodak DX4530 5MP Digital CameraVideo Cable ( for slideshows on TV)Product manual ( i suggest you read this)Kodak Easyshare software ( nice software, with a simple, but effective and fun editing program.) 5 sheets of trial photo paper.Other ads and papers reguarding registration.AS i conclude, i have one last thing for those interested in it's 10X zoom.  optical zoom(3X) is the actual lens zooming in.  digital zoom(3.3X) is just the camera enlarging the pixels.  What is done with digital zoom is something that can be easily done on a photo editing software.  So if you're paying over 5-10 dollars for just extra digital zoom, id not.  The optical is what you really want.Overall, i have been EXTREMELY pleased with camera, and i would recommend it for anyone.  The movie mode is very nice, although you can't zoom while it is recording.  But, what more could you ask for, hopefully you aren't buying this to make a movie.  My only complaint is that the movie mode is slightly blocky, but is still fun to play with.  This camera is very user friendly, and i would say it could be used easily by 10 years old and up.  The manual is easy to comprehend and read.  Kodak also has a good support staff, and my camera came in perfect shape.  Thank you for your time, and i would strongley suggest this camera for anyone.", "Date": "January 3, 2004"}, {"Title": "Wonderful Camera!", "Author": "JDV \"Can you play with the big dogs?\"", "ReviewID": "RWM1QABLLRXBY", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I got this camera a few months ago, and absolutely love it.

Couse \"darkman1969\"", "ReviewID": "R1YYMQAVZT69VZ", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I have had this camera about 2 weeks now and I can honestly say there is not a single thing I dislike about it.  I took it on a trip to Estes Park, CO and the pictures came out fantastic.  The detail is amazing and the color was spot on.I've also had no problems with the indoor quality of my pictures and what I don't like I can easily correct with my photoshop program.The unit is lightweight and fits nice in the palm of my hand.  It has 5 seperate modes (auto, sport, night, scenery and macro) and it even takes Quicktime Video!  I specifically purchased this unit becuase of the Kodak name and the cameras ability to accept SD cards.  I think that CF (compactflash) is on the way out and I already had a SD card for my PPC.The camera hooked up to my WinXP machine without any trouble and I was transferring photos and video within minutes.Where I think this camera really shines is the Kodak Easy Share software.  It lets you unload your camera, create albums, modify the photo (very basic stuff though), and even order prints online!  I've already taken advantage of the online ordering and the quality is fantastic.  I highly recommend you have a broadband connection though, since the file size on \"best\" setting is rather large.Dont be afraid to try this camera!", "Date": "October 17, 2003"}, {"Title": "Excellent camera for beginners, great for Moderate users", "Author": "Nickels", "ReviewID": "R1FTS0YDO37YWL", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "If you don't know what an F Stop is, have no idea how shutter speed effects your photograph, or don't know aperture from temperature then this camera is for you. Kodak's Easyshare is your basic \"turn it on, aim and shoot\" type camera. All it takes to operate this camera is the ability to insert a battery. The picture quality is amazing in normal lighting conditions, but does suffer a little in low light without some user knowledge or a tripod. The camera has a few features that you can tweak, such as small exposure adjustments. My favorite feature on this camera is the movie mode. Having mini movies with sound is such a joy when you want to show people something, and a still picture just doesn't cut it (like baby's first steps). I almost find I am making more movies then taking pictures these days.I was initially unhappy at the ease of use, since I am a photography junkie that loves total control of everything. However, as time has gone by I find that I am getting exactly the types of pictures that I want to get, but I don't have to do all of the thinking anymore. If you don't mind letting the camera do most of the work then look no farther. For price, quality, and ease of use I would give this product an A+. Lastly, I would recommend that you purchase rechargeable batteries and a charger, and also at least a 256k memory card.Happy photographing.", "Date": "June 1, 2004"}, {"Title": "wonderful all-around camera", "Author": "M. H Shamp", "ReviewID": "RJ5X0B28VHD0U", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I bought the Kodak 5 MP camera as an up grade for my HP 320 2MP camera.  I notice another person here mention that he was displeased with his Kodak because he couldn't tell the difference between his new 5 MP camera as compared to his old 2MP camera, so he returned it.  My experience is the same as his - at first.  If I take a picture of my room with both cameras, I cannot tell the difference at all at casual glance simply because the 2MP camera I have does such a wonderful job of normal picture taking.  I really recommend people who just want normal pictures and don't want to part with a lot of dough to stick with the 2 MP cameras, because it costs half of what a 5 MP camera costs.However, I must stress that there IS a difference between the picture qualities of the 5MP and the 2MP camera.  It is just that the difference isn't that obvious, and you have to look very carefully to see it.  The 5 MP camera is definitely better and if you look at its pictures long enough, you will notice it.  The main reason I bought this camera is so that I can take close-up pictures of dishes I cook so that I can show off my cooking to friends.  Without a doubt, the 5 MP camera takes clearer pictures of close objects, but this is not to say that the 2 MP camera can't do it.  It just doesn't do such a good job, but it does do an acceptable job - a friend said the shot of my lasagna with the 2MP camera made her mouth water.  The 5 MP cameras don't do a perfect job of it either when compared with the professional pictures I see in cook books, but it is better by about 20%.  You have to be picky to see the difference.Overall, the Kodak 5 MP camera has the following major benefits over the HP 2 MP camera:1. It has a lens cap.2. It does short little movies.3. It allows you to delete pictures selectively from within the camera.  This is a very nice feature when you go on trips because then you can get rid of messed up pictures and not take up as much memory space.4. It has a close up option for objects between 2 to 28 inches.5. It has a night option to allow you to take pictures in the semi-dark.6. It has a sport option to allow you to take pictures that are moving.  (The HP camera does a fine job of taking pictures in a moving vehicle, however.)7. The LCD screen is clearer and brighter.8. There is a TV plug-in that allows you to look at the pictures from the camera directly into a TV (I can't imagine why anybody wants to do that, but it is an option)9. It has an easyshare button to send pictures directly to printers, but I find this option pointless because printing pictures costs a lot (ink and photo paper), so why wouldn't anyone look at the pictures on the computer first and choose the best ones before they try to print it or email it?There is one drawback to the Kodak camera package:  the software that comes with it isn't half as powerful as the HP software.  My main complaint is that you can't crop a picture completely at will.  What's worse, when the picture is cropped, it still just as big as the original one in memory, and even if you shrink it, it is still humongous and slow to send.  For example, I have the same picture cropped and shrunk to identical size (about 5 by seven inch) by the two programs.  The resulting pictures look identical, but the HP software's picture is 43 kB whereas the Kodak one is 304 kilobytes!  When you have a dial-up connection and have a lot of pictures to send like me, you will find the Kodak software very irritating.  I can't believe they call themselves \"easyshare\" when it isn't easy to share at all. The conclusion is that if you are stingy and uncomfortable with dishing out a lot of dough, you are better off with a 2 MP camera.  It does an excellent job of point-and-shoot.  If you like to have a camera that does everything and you don't want to be caught with a cheap camera, the Kodak one is the way to go.  Don't be surprised, however, if you can't tell the difference.A word of warning to those who wants the 2 MP camera:  My HP 320 has a very high customer rating at Amazon.com when I bought it six months ago.  Since then, however, I notice that HP came out with a newer version of HP320 that Amazon is selling.  It costs only half of what I paid, and the customer rating isn't as good either.  I cannot speak for that new model, but I can say that my HP 320 takes perfectly clear pictures.", "Date": "November 7, 2003"}, {"Title": "AN EXCEPTIONAL VALUE", "Author": "Tim Janson", "ReviewID": "R3PI40DFEJ6Z7Z", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "When I decided to buy my first digital camera recently I was quite dazed by the number of choices.

I bought the camera, loaded the software on my laptop and was up and running in less than 2 mins.  The docking station is a must for quick transfers of pictures.  I am also impressed with the software, as it is super easy to create albums, crop pictures, and order prints (Kodak uses Ofoto- which has been a good service for us).  My only complaint (and it is a big one) is taking pictures at night is a pain in the rear.  The engineers must have been drunk when they designed the camera, as they put the flashing green light next to the viewfinder -making it virtually impossible to see through the viewfinder at night.  It is completely annoying.  That being said, the quality of night pictures are good (if your lucky enough to hit your target through the viewfinder).

This camera does not take good dim light zoomed shots from a distance (as in from the back of a theatre to the stage). Everything else about this camera is great. It is easy to use, and well-lit or flashed photos are beautiful. The picture settings do help in different situations. The action setting is so good that I was able to take blur-free pictures of my cat jumping in the air after a string. Other settings include night shots, close up, and distance. You can also adjust the flash for red-eye, fill, or turn it off. Due to the delay from the time you press the button to the time the picture is taken, hold the button down slightly prior to taking the picture. When you do press, it will snap instantly.The movie mode is actually nice. I didn't think I'd use it, but it's great to have when you want to capture more than just a picture.As an added bonus, the software that comes with it to retrieve and view your pictures is very easy to use.I highly recommend this camera, but you should also get a memory card so you can take more pictures.", "Date": "June 17, 2004"}, {"Title": "Great Quality for Price, Especially Video!", "Author": null, "ReviewID": "RO4B7XZJ1VHXZ", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I must say this is my first purchase of a digital camera, but I am very pleased with my choice.  I was looking for a resonably priced yet high quality digital camera.  I don't think you can find another 5.0 megapixel camera for this price.  Another thing I liked about it was the option to that videos with sound.  That was something I wanted in a camera.  Unfortunately, you have to buy a decent size card in order to get any length at all.  I bought a 256 MB card, and I take 1-3 minute clips.  It works out great for me.  I think with the card, I can take a little over 16 minutes of video, plus a few high quality pictures.  I bought the card from accupc.com which I ran across while looking for a the least expensive card.  I don't have the dock because I order my prints online from clarkcolor.com (can prepay for prints at 19 cents each), which to me is more cost efficient than the price of the docking station and paper, etc.  Plus I have a CD burner on my computer but not a DVD burner.  I found a program called EOVideo for 34.95 which converts the videos (in Quicktime format) to SVCD which can be burned on to a CD and then played on most DVD players.

I ordered some of the pictures online, and also blew one up to 10x8 using the Kodak machine at the local grocery store. They all came out beautiful!  One thing that worried me, however, was that after a while the camera wouldn't turn on by itself when the cap was on (I had to turn it on and off 2 or 3 times). But that wasn't a big problem, as it worked fine if I took the cap off manually. I have also noticed that you have to be extra careful not to shake while taking pictures inside, as they can get a little blurried. But that didn't happen at all with the pictures taken outside. The other negative for me was the software included. I installed it at first, but noticed it overrode my Windows XP photo viewer -- and the annoying thing is that using the Kodak software, there was no arrow to go back or forward to view another picture on a bigger scale. I removed the software, and am doing fine downloading my pictures using XP's scanner/camera automatic detection, and fixing them with an editing software I have used for a few years.Despite all the little problems listed above, for the price, you can't find a better camera.

My father bought this camera for me, and although it wasn't as \"high tech\" as the cameras I was originally comparing, I must say that I am fairly pleased with the Kodak.The internal memory is nice because you don't have to buy a memory card unless you take several dozen pictures at a time.  It will hold about 24 pictures taken in the highest quality setting.The controls are simple and easy to understand; many digital cameras overwhelm the user with difficult, confusing, and seemingly endless menus.  Unless you like being able to control the shutter speed, aperature, and other manual settings, you'll enjoy how simple the Kodak makes digital photography.  A big plus is that the camera includes a brief explanation for menu items so that the user isn't confused about what abbreviations stand for.Some people have mentioned the blurring that takes place; blurring takes place with most cameras because the shutter speed is generally slower with digital cameras.  And the shutter delay is VERY good with this camera; several digital cameras that I have tested have had horrible shutter lag.  The Kodak's delay is minimal.The dock is nice for convenient recharging; once you're done taking pictures, just put it on the dock.  It's also nice for transferring pictures.  Put the camera on the dock, push the \"Kodak\" button, and your preferred program automatically opens for downloading.  One downfall I've found is that the software is not compatible with Mac OS X, which I have, so I've had to use iPhoto for downloading pictures.  (Which is fine, since that's where I keep pictures anyway.)  (UPDATE:  The software is now compatible with Mac OSX.)In short:  pros of this camera: ease of use, simple menus, convenient recharging, internal memory (no need for memory card).  Cons:  short battery life when using LCD screen for picture taking; lens cap has a tendency to come off when bumped slightly (bad if you're carrying it in a bag).", "Date": "December 28, 2003"}, {"Title": "Not happy", "Author": null, "ReviewID": "RB9PN3K75W5KG", "Overall": "1.0", "Content": "I purchased the dx4530 after reading review and research.

Though exposure features and overall setup are similar to previous EasyShare models (most notably the DX4330 model), the DX4530 boasts a larger, 5.0-megapixel CCD for capturing high resolution, print quality images, as well as smaller image sizes better suited for distributing via email.\"Another review at Steve's Digicams concludes: \"The DX4530 is an entry-level yet high resolution camera with a quality 3x optical zoom lens. This is a perfect camera for anyone that wants to easily capture sharp and well saturated pictures, indoors or out, with little or no prior experience. And with an average street price of $350 or less you won't need a bank loan to purchase one.\" It shoots \"gorgeous prints\" and \"The bottom line on the DX4530 is that it captures very good images in a variety of sizes suitable for email use to wall-size enlargements. It's easy to use and is priced within the budgets of many consumers that previously would have only been able to buy a lower resolution camera.A world class lens and powerful 5.0 MP combine to give you huge, stunning prints up to 20\"x30\" (50x75cm)KODAK RETINAR Aspheric All-Glass Lens with 3X optical zoomBright indoor/outdoor displayProgrammed scene modes and creative settingsSharing is one-touch simpleVideo and audio captureAnd as Kodak shows on their home page: \"J.D. Power and Associates ranked KODAK EASYSHARE Digital Cameras \"Highest in Customer Satisfaction in the $200-$399 and the $400-$599 price ranges.\"This is one of those cameras that will provide great shots and last for many years to come at a great price.  The kodak site (and many others) retail it for $299, camera only.  Because it's not the newest of the brand new, you can get a great deal on it in comparison to those that are the cutting edge, just-released models. Other 5MP cameras in this price range are nowhere near the quality, design or output.The DX4530  makes for a great holiday gift that's not so hard on the wallet.  This is one sweet camera especially for those who don't want to have to spend a lot of time reading tiny print, learning a million geek-tweaks -- it's easy to take it out and start shooting.

Rarely is a tech product good enough to remain useful nearly 7 years after its debut, but I still use this camera all the time.The camera takes beautiful shots, especially outdoors. The optical zoom is great, and always provides a clear picture when employed. The flash is good, though you do need to be careful about redeye. The facial recognition software is great, and for the time this camera was made, was absolutely fantastic. The image stabilizer is really great as well. It was one of the first camera's Id used that let you focus by holding the shoot button down half way, letting you take instant shots with no delay. (If you dont realize this, your shots will take forever, and will always end up blurry, I think many buyers dont realize this).5MP is more than enough for most people, I end up shrinking down most of my photos anyway. A few people mentioned interior photos are too dark, but if you give the camera a second or two to adjust, or manually change settings, Ive had no problems at all.The camera is exceptionally durable. After my friend crammed a broken SD card in the slot, the sd reader rarely works, but I can't blame that on the camera. It spends most of its time getting crushed under text books while my backpack is being thrown around, and the though the plastic cover for the LCD screen recently cracked (the screen is still 100%) Ive never had any problems whatsoever.The only downsides are only a few downsides. This is a large camera. Though not oversized for the time, modern consumers will find the camera very bulky and a bit heavy. It's comfortable in a pants pocket, but its the only thing you'll be putting in that pants pocket.The other big downside is the battery. While it claims AA batteries are usable, they really aren't. You need to buy http://www.amazon.com/Kodak-MAX-CRV3-Lithium-Battery/dp/B0000632T3 or equivalent. When I first bought the camera, these were expensive, which was a major downside. Now however, they're only about twice the price of 2 double A's for the Duracell brand, and they last a for a long long time. I can count on my fingers how many times Ive changed the battery in 5 years. I dont have any experience with rechargeables on this camera.The only other improvement I can imagine is allowing longer video clips. Each video clip is limited to 60 seconds. This is enough to make it useful, but it would be great to be able to record for hours to an big SD card. You also cant zoom in or out whithout stopping your video shot and starting again.Overall a great camera. If you happen to come across one I'd still recommend it against most new cameras for the price. The camera feels more like a film camera than a digital camera, and this could be nice for not so tech savvy people.Then:-------------------Overall: 10/10Picture: 9/10Durability: 10/10Features: 8.5/10Ease of Use: 10/10Size/Weight: 8/10Now:-------------------Overall: 7.5/10Picture: 8/10Durability: 10/10Features: 7.5/10Ease of Use: 8.5/10Size/Weight: 4/10", "Date": "December 10, 2009"}, {"Title": "LOVE THIS LITTLE CAMERA !!", "Author": "Emma Caroline", "ReviewID": "R1CEA51TLC1ZLY", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I bought this before Christmas 2 years ago.

LOL at how far camera technology has come.  When I purchased this camera, 5 megapixels was HUGE in a point and shoot camera.This is a eulogy to a wonderful camera, I purchased the easyshare in November of 2002.  My husband had dunked our 20 year old (hand me down from his parents) Cannon with all the lenses in the Atlantic just weeks before our son was born.  The cheapie 35 mm camera from the drug store wasn't doing it, so we purchased the Easyshare.  What a phenomenal camera!  The software practically loads itself into your computer, I guess I read the instruction manual, but the camera is so easy to use its barely neccessary.  I have taken incredible pictures with this camera in all kinds of situations, babies sleeping in darkened rooms, playing in their pool outside,later running and jumping action shots, this camera captured all of it, with amazing clarity and color.My complaints about the camera are few, I wish it could take a faster photos, its a long time between turning the camera on and the photo.  Like digital cameras of today, it eats batteries.  I liked that the camera had the option of looking through the eyepiece or use the display screen, that saved a few batteries.  At some point I started to feel like the camera was a little too bulky,  I didn't bring it to my 20th class reunion because it was a little to bulky to fit easily in my purse.  The ultra thin models were ubiquitous at that point, I didn't want to appear outdated.Nine years later, we are at an amusement park, it's my daughters birthday, she is surrounded by princesses, storybook characters and a dancing troupe all singing happy birthday to her, and my Kodak chose that moment to die.  I will miss that camera.  I had that camera so long I had to call Kodak and beg for a software update for our new computer, the original was too outdated to load properly.I just spent the entire weekend looking over Amazons hundreds of cameras, reading countless customer reviews.  After much deliberation, I chose the Panasonic DMC-ZS8.  I chose it for the quality of pictures it takes, and the hopes I can get 10 years out of this camera as well.

We sat the camera down on the putting green right behind the hole and watch the golf balls go in not to mention the sound was pretty good. Don't by the docking station. We are still using the original battery that it comes with.Hope this helps you out. I was going to buy the Nikon I'm glad I didn't.

But I really wanted a camera for every day use. One that fits in my purse, but wasn't so small that my husband couldn't use it too. After a lot of research, I decided digital was the way to go and bought the Kodak DX4530.I love the camera. My husband actually enjoys taking pictures now too. The picture quality is great. The night setting is awesome and has just the right amount of flash to take clear pictures in low light. The LCD screen is crystal clear in good lighting, but harder to see in low light, only when framing your picture though. Once the shot is taken, it appears in true form on the LCD. It is also fast - so you don't miss those important shots and I haven't had any problems with blurry shots.The only things I don't like about the camera are probably the features Kodak scrimped on in order to offer the DX4530 at such a great price. 1) The lens cap falls off on it's own in the camera bag. 2) The lens is a Kodak, not the higher quality lens protected by a shutter found on some of KPdak's pricier cameras. 3) This is no fault of Kodak, but with 5 MP, the pictures take up a lot of memory, on the camera and on the memory card, so you definitely want to buy a memory card, maybe a few.

This camera was made before you could buy a 10 MP camera new for $75. I paid $75 for it used and it has proven to be money well spent. It is our \"go to\" camera for point and shoot use.Every family gathering we attend, this 5 MP camera routinely outperforms newer model cameras with larger file size capabilities. The sister in-laws with 8 and 10 MP cameras are perplexed by their cameras inferiority to the DX4530 and always ask how we take such great photos.One cool feature this camera possesses is that it actually has a viewfinder (you know, the little glass window folks used to peer through for a preview of their shot) in addition to an LCD screen. I am not aware of any point and shoot digital cameras made with a viewfinder now. The viewfinder is good for two reasons - (1) it allows you to save money on batteries by disabling the \"live view\" LCD screen, and (2) it reduces camera shake when you press it against your face to take a photo.I really don't have a problem with the lens cap and \"bulk\" I have read others complaining about. Compared to the 35mm's I grew up with this thing is tiny.This camera has been a real workhorse over the last 6 years. If you can find a used one in good condition I would jump on it.
