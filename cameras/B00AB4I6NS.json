{"Reviews": [{"Title": "Good point-and-shoot upgrade, bad DSLR downgrade", "Author": "Uncle J", "ReviewID": "R30R8RXJTZ8ZHC", "Overall": "3.0", "Content": "Before I begin, let it be known that I come from the DSLR world, I'm what most people would consider a \"pro-consumer\" or serious enthusiast,  I've owned many pro-grade cameras, my last one was the Canon 5Dmk3, which cleaned out my bank account along with some L lenses, I love the 5Dmk3, and I know that no cropped-frame camera can (yet) come close to it, so I'm not here to compare the NEX-6 to a pro-grade body. Why the NEX-6? or any mirror-less compact {powerful} camera?: After having a baby last year I could not carry my 5D/lenses around with a diaper bag, formula, bottle warmer, stroller, and all the crap my wife makes me carry. So I went to the mirror-less line a little over a ago when the NEX-7 came out, I've had the NEX7 for about a year now, but I've never been fully satisfied with it, it is great, but not all that great. I sold it a week ago after listing it on Amazon (I didn't think it would sell so fast!) And so with the earnings/lost money from the NEX7, I wanted to try this NEX-6, the new features of it and see if the NEX line is still for me, or if I should jump ship, sell the rest of my NEX lenses and go micro 4/3 (MFT) with the Olympus OM-D EM5 (which is the camera that most people consider NEX-6's top competitor).  So here we go...I've had the NEX-6 for about 10 days now and I've been testing the OM-D for about 4 days now, so I feel pretty confident and ready to give my review:What I really like about the NEX-6:+ Great ISO (low light) performance. Better than the NEX7, and slightly better than the OM-D (this is due to a larger APS-C sensor than OM-D's Micro 4/3, and compared to the NEX-7, the NEX-6 has a lower MP count on this sensor, the NEX7 has more resolution, but images have considerably more noise at 1600 ISO and above). I still hold some reservations against the way Sony implemented Auto-ISO (more on that on the CONs section of this review) but overall the NEX-6 is pleasant for low light shots (without a flash) of the baby sleeping. Low light performance is HUGE for me, it is a MUST to take good pictures indoors and of my (now very-mobile) baby around the house as she recently learned to walk.+ Kit lens (16-50mm electronic zoom) is more compact that the original NEX7 kit lens, and it behaves well, easy to use, IQ is great, just as good, if not better than the old 18-55 kit lens, though note that the NEX-6 body does have some magic to correct the distortion and other imperfections that the lens produces if you were to use it on an older NEX model.+ WiFi (between camera and phone): Some people report this to be problematic and hard to use. I did not think so, I think it's fairly easy to use and great! (that is WiFi between the camera and a phone/tablet, setting up WiFi settings without a touchscreen is another story, more on that later) I was able to link up with my iPhone and send pictures from the camera to my phone quickly, very cool when you want to show off how cute your baby is on-the-spot and quickly post the picture to a social network, or just have it available on your phone... NICE!+ built-in flash, I was used to this from having the NEX7, same exact operation, the cool thing about this built flash (different from most other mirror-less) is that you can move it as you take the shot and bounce the light off the ceiling for a more natural look, (the OM-D does NOT have this capability and you have to attach the flash, which is worthless) great for quick portraits or fill-light, this flash is one of the best things about this camera!+ Overall Image Quality: This really should be the number one concern, and it is! in good light and even low light, this camera can produce some amazing shots, it focuses quickly (in good lighting conditions, more on that later), and pictures are sharp most of the time.+ The EVF: Some people love it, some hate it, I think it is awesome! I use it a lot to review pictures and zoom into the images to do a little pixel peeping to see if I got the focus right where I wanted it. Same as the NEX-7. Good implementation in my opinion+ Creative options: I like that (like the NEX-7) this camera has a lot of creative options like HDR, retro-look, single-out colors, rich tone B/W and others which are fun for casual pics without the need to play around in post-processing. I know that \"Pro's\" do not care for them, but I think these are fun to try different styles and seeing what they look like before you transfer the pics from your SD card.What I wish Sony would have done better (what I do NOT like):-BIG ONE: At nearly $900, this small camera should have had at least SOME type of weather sealing, it is NOT weather sealed at all! so if you are constantly traveling, going to the beach, rainy season in Florida, your house is dusty (like mine), or your kids spit apple juice at you as you're taking a picture then you WILL have some issues. I took the camera to the beach and I had to really watch it to make sure it did not end up on the sand or wet. At the end of the day the ON/OFF switch seemed \"stuck\", oh crap! It obviously got sand or a small grain in the ridge of the switch. Also, the electronic-zoom kit lens looks like it got some dust (which can end up inside the lens or on the sensor) due to its mechanical operation as you turn the camera ON and OFF.  No weather sealing is a big buzz-kill for me-Auto-Focus in low light: I earlier spoke about how good AF is in good lighting, in low light is really not all that great. I thought it would be a huge improvement on this camera due to the new hybrid system that it sports, but I was less than impressed with its capabilities. I know how to use a camera so please do not give me an \"expert\" comment about me not knowing how to properly use the settings for AF. The AF in low-light WORKS, but was not impressive. In reality the new AF system that Sony raves about so much is really not much of an improvement compared to what older NEX models have.-Auto-ISO settings are wacked-out!: I really dislike what Sony has done (and has been doing) on the NEX system when it comes to Auto ISO; first: Auto ISO goes up to 3200 indoors without the need to go so high, second; you CANNOT change the ISO limits for auto ISO, so you are stuck having to use 3200 ISO when it could actually be lower, giving you unnecessary picture noise; third there is no auto-ISO in \"M\" Mode.. why Sony? Auto-ISO is like AF, why would anyone have to constantly change the ISO to get the picture right? the camera should do that for you! this results in missed shots having to set up the ISO correctly, or bad photos with noise.-Apps /App store: WTF Sony? I already paid $900 for a camera, and now you want me to pay more for \"apps\" that are features that the new camera should have come with? Really? you guys are going iPhone style? SOME apps are free, but you have to create a Sony account on your PC. Oh yeah, and I forgot to mention that typing network settings without a touch screen is a pain in the...., which leads to my next point:-No touch-screen: Touch-screen would have been helpful for spot focus using the new AF system, which I find a big loss! But what is really annoying is having to use the track-wheel to type letter-by-letter network settings to use WiFi, login to their app store, or do anything that requires a keyboard on the screen. If Sony wants people to use the camera to generate more revenue for them via Apps, then the least they could have done was giving their consumers the capability to quickly type on the screen.-No Image Stabilization on the body, only on the lens: This is not a major issue unless you have really shaky hands, Canon and Nikon do the same, their lenses use stabilization (IS for Canon, VC for Nikon) and the bodies do not have stabilization. Seems to work well with those systems, but NOT on the NEX. And the NEX lenses that do have Optical Stabilization do not really show it. The 16-50mm kit lens' optical stabilization is crap! crap! crap! crap! compared to the Canon's IS lenses, this lens has ZERO protection against camera shake. I honestly think it is just a gimmick from Sony to make the lens sell for more, because anything shot under 1/60 shutter speed is prone to camera shake. I have fairly steady hands when I shoot, but I always found that Canon's IS made my shots sharper while using IS and a slower shutter speed. Not the case with NEX's (supposedly) Optically Stabilized lenses. Other Sony Alpha bodies have stabilization, why not put it on the NEX-6?-USB charging instead of a battery wall plug... Why Sony? The NEX7 came with a small sized plug-fold-out wall plug unit to recharge your battery, that way you can even buy an extra one and leave it charging at the hotel while you are out shooting, but the NEX-6 only comes with a USB cable to charge the battery while is on the camera... So I cannot use the camera until it is charged? let me at least buy an extra battery and is will charge it on my own, but NO, I have to go buy an extra battery AND a charger! Thanks Sony, NOT!-------The NEX6 has some really good things, but after testing the Olympus OM-D EM5 and doing side-by-side comparison of the picture quality, I just cannot justify keeping the NEX6. I will not go into details about the OM-D on this review, since it is an NEX6 review, and let it be known that the Olympus it is not a perfect camera either (what camera is?), and there are things about the NEX6 that blow away the OM-D, like its ergonomics, the built-in flash, and the EVF. The quickest way to compare the two (from my perspective) is by telling you that the NEX-6 is more for those looking to simplify from their DSLR, or move up from a point-and-shoot to obtain a powerful-featured, large-sensor small camera, and the OM-D EM5 is more of a mini-DSLR, which does have a smaller sensor than the NEX-6, but completely outperforms it, while giving the user much more control over the camera settings.I know that people (including me) read these reviews as part of their research before they spend their hard-earned money on these gadgets. I usually either recommend a product or not. This time I am being very critical of the NEX6, but I am not knocking it down, so I cannot recommend it or not recommend it, what I can say is that IT IS one of the top 2 or 3 cameras (right now) in the mirror-less arena. But personally, I will return the one I got because it is a camera that I really wanted to like, has tremendous potential, but Sony did a half-ass job in bringing it to life. Perhaps they did it on-purpose to keep the NEX-7 as the flagship camera, but in reality, this NEX-6 should have been Sony's top-dog for the NEX line. I DO think it is a good camera, has great value (the OM-D is much more expensive), and it is a great step-up for anyone shooting with a point-and-shoot or with their phone, while it is also too much of a step-down for those giving up their DSLR. Hope this helps your decision!J.", "Date": "June 7, 2013"}, {"Title": "Nearly perfect - a pocketable camera for high image quality", "Author": "Michael Sandman", "ReviewID": "R63WPL86K2PXH", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "In 1973 I bought a Rollei 35 - a 35mm camera with a collapsible 40 mm f/3.5 lens. It cost $200, equal to about $1,000 today.  It was fully manual - no auto- anything.  There was an optical viewfinder but no rangefinder.  It took great pictures and fit in a coat pocket.  Now we have the Sony NEX-6, only marginally larger than the Rollei, effectively for the same price when you adjust for inflation.Even though I have a Canon 5D Mark II, a wonderful DSLR, its size and weight are a big deterrent to taking it with me routinely.  So I wanted a camera designed in the spirit of the Rollei 35 - to fit in a coat pocket, have a sensor big enough to make 11 x 14 enlargements, have a zoom lens with a 24mm field of view, and a have a built-in viewfinder, not an add-on, and not just an LCD.  Until now (11/2012) the options were the Sony NEX-7, upcoming Fuji X-E1 and the larger Olympus OM-D, all at $1300 or more.I have now taken about 500 shots and the NEX-6 is close to perfect for my purposes - a digital reincarnation of the Rollei 35.  But it won't be right for everyone.The heart of the NEX-6 is an APS-C size sensor, the size in the vast majority of DSLRs.  It's 1.5 times the size of a the \"4/3rds\" sensor found in similar Olympus and Panasonic cameras and 3 times the size of the sensor in Nikon 1 cameras.  As a result, the image quality is excellent up to ISO 1600 and not bad up to ISO 6400.  A new Sony kit lens gives a field of view equal to 24-75mm on a 35mm camera.  The lens focuses quickly and collapses to a small size, so the camera fits in a coat pocket or the corner of a backpack.  There are some complaints on Internet forums about the lens vignetting and about distortion at the wide end.  The camera corrects distortion in JPEGs by itself (unless you turn that feature off).  Although the raw images are not corrected, they're easily correctable in Photoshop etc.  Adobe and Aperture both have offered the usual downloadable updates to interpret NEX-6 raw files, so if you prefer to edit raw files you can make distortion corrections with standard software tools.All shooting parameters are readily adjustable. There's a standard \"PASM\" dial for selecting the shooting mode.  The initial setup menu is complicated and not entirely logical but you can configure the controls very flexibly.  Most notably, you can program the Fn button to call up the six parameters you change most frequently - ISO, drive mode, metering mode...  There are 16 parameters to choose from.  The LCD can display a full set of shooting parameters and you can adjust each one with the control dial on the back, so you after initial setup don't have to go into the menu to change settings.The viewfinder is electronic, not optical as with a DSLR.  It's like a little LCD with 2.1 million dots.  It's sharp and very responsive, but not as good as an optical viewfinder in low light.  (To get the full value of the viewfinder, be sure to adjust the diopter wheel to suit your eye.)  The LCD screen folds up or down so you can hold the camera at your waist or above your head.  The LCD is not touch-sensitive.  Oddly, Sony's NEX-5N and the new NEX-5R cameras have that feature, A touch-sensitive LCD would be helpful for entering WiFi passwords and selecting menu options, but if you buy the Sony NEX-5R, you give up the NEX-6's PASM control dial and other control features as well as the excellent built-in viewfinder (though you can buy a clip-on accessory EVF).You charge the battery via a USB cable, not a charger that plugs into the wall, which means you can charge it from a computer or in many cars, but there's no way to charge a spare battery.  (There are inexpensive aftermarket charges on Amazon & elsewhere; it's probably best to buy a \"genuine\" Sony if you want a spare battery.)  Battery life is just fair.  The camera tries to autofocus continuously, which eats battery life.  Supposedly Sony is going to fix that with a firmware update.  The camera also has WiFi, which reduces battery life.  WiFi lets you control the camera remotely with a smart phone and upload photos.  Using it  is non-intuitive and badly integrated with the rest of the menu system.  Sony's instructions for WiFi setup are useless.  Error messages appear to be literal translations from Japanese, like reading something from a 1960 made-in-Japan radio.  The LCD does not have a touch screen, so entering WiFi SSIDs and passwords is done using a QWERTY soft keyboard that is a bit clumsy to navigate.  Worse, your Sony password for downloading apps is entered using a soft version of a phone keypad, even though the QWERTY keyboard is available for entering WiFi access point info.  Although WiFi setup is very clumsy, once it's done it does open up some interesting options. Example: with the remote control app you can see the image from the camera on you phone or tablet and use it for precise focusing, and trip the shutter, of course.  But you can't adjust aperture or shutter speed, at least in the current version of the app. (Edit added 3/15/2013: There are aftermarket products that let you use an iPad/iPhone to do that.)The positives - especially the excellent image quality and the ease of setting a wide range of shooting parameters -- greatly outweigh the negatives.  If you already have a small DSLR like a Canon Rebel or Nikon 3200 or similar, the size advantage from an NEX-6 is marginal.  But if you have a \"pro-sumer\" or full-frame DSLR and you want a highly capable camera you can easily take almost everywhere, the NEX-6 is a worthwhile choice, If you don't have a DSLR and you're think about getting one, the NEX-6 is a good alternative - a DSLR near-equivalent you can put in a coat pocket.", "Date": "November 10, 2012"}, {"Title": "Yes! Yes! Yes! Yes! Yes! Meh... Huh?", "Author": "Michael McKee \"mystic cowboy\"", "ReviewID": "R3HSCVFG28KLB5", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "Bottom line, the NEX 6 is a well designed camera that's easy to use and takes good quality photos. The finish and balance of the camera are excellent and - for the most part - it's a joy to use.This is Sony's 8th NEX camera in just over two years. You can't say that they aren't serious about the camera line. The NEX 6 is an enthusiast's camera. It's for photographers who are looking for more manual controls than are available in the NEX 3 or 5 models. It has a similar 16 MP sensor to the others and the same very good image quality. You aren't gaining better picture quality in getting the 6 vs one of the NEX 3 or 5 models. So if you are moving up from a phone camera or a point and shoot, you might find one of the other models closer to what you are used to than the NEX 6.On the other hand, if you are looking at the NEX 6 as second camera, or even as a replacement for a bigger one, the 6 is much more portable than a DSLR the extra dials and buttons on the NEX 6 will speed up camera mode and exposure changes. So, on to the specificsThe first yes is the inclusion of an electronic viewfinder (EVF), similar to the one in the NEX 7. That's a great inclusion and makes the 6 more versatile. It's seems similar to the NEX 7 EVF and the same pixel dimension. The EVF is sharp and clear. It works well on this size camera.The second yes is the addition of a flash shoe, a real one that accepts all sorts of manual flashes. It's a change from the old reversed Minolta/Sony flash shoe, so if you have old Sony flashes you will need an adaptor. The newest Sony flashes are built the new flash shoe. The camera also has a built in flash, instead of the screw on model on my old NEX 5n. Flash sync is a slow 1/160, which a bit disappointing but at least the camera will now support more flashes and off camera flash.The third and fourth yeses encompass the inclusion of a mode dial and a camera top control dial. These aren't the same as the NEX 7 dials but will be immediately familiar to experienced camera users. The control dial and the mode dial are stacked on the same spindle. I wasn't sure how that would work, but in practice, just fine. The only thing I would have like to have added is the ability to use the back panel control dial for more functions, like exposure compensation in A or S modes. That's not currently possible and can't be customized. This may change with a firmware update. My fingers are crossed. Sony still includes the some very helpful camera modes like sweep panorama and hand held twilight, along with a bunch of others. The inclusion of a mode dial makes accessing these faster and easiser.The fifth yes is the new position for the movie button. The button on my NEX 5n is where I often push it accidentally. In fact, I seldom spent more than a half hour shooting without accidentally starting a movie. The button on the NEX 7 is even easier to mistakenly activate. The problem on the 7 is so bad that Sony made a software update to deactivate the movie button entirely. On the 6, Sony has simply moved the button to a location where your right thumb won't rest naturally on it. The movie button is a little awkward to use now, but not too much so.The meh, is the new lens. Oh, it's an improvement over the old kit lens, mostly. The size is perfect for a NEX camera. The lens looks great and when it's closed nobody will remark that you look like you have a lens with a little bit of camera behind it. Build quality is good. Finish is good, However, this is not the high optical quality kit lens for the NEX 7 that many of us have wanted. It's decently sharp for a kit lens, but it's still a kit lens and it has a kit lens' slow aperture.Sony still includes the some very helpful modes like sweep panorama and hand held twilight, along with a bunch of others. The inclusion of a mode dial makes accessing these faster and easiser.On the down side focus is a bit slower than with the old kit lens. Sony has done some sort of magic with the NEX 6 sensor that's supposed to make it focus more quickly. That may be so, but it's not my experience. When I place the NEX 6 and the NEX 5n side by side in tripods and activated the shutter button, the camera with the old kit lens generally reached focus more quickly than the one with the new lens. This isn't a scientific test with instruments, but the new lens didn't wow me with it's focus speed. My other problem with the new lens is that it has a zoom motor instead of direct gearing for zoom. I guess that this is a requirement of the collapsing lens and it's compactness. The lens doesn't have the tactile feedback of a non-motorized lens. It's also a bit slower to zoom. On the plus side, zooming is smoother during movie shooting. Also the new lens seems to provide a bit more shake control than the old kit lens while shooting movies. For stills, they are both good.The huh is for Sony eliminating the touch screen on the NEX 6. Sony seems to think that more serious photographers won't want a touch screen. I do. Still, I can somewhat see their point. What's brain dead, though, is adding apps to the camera that you can't interact with on the screen. Duh. It's like stepping back from using a new iPhone and having to navigate through an old fashioned dumb phone. Yes, you have to use buttons and the back control wheel to get around in the app interfaces. Talk about user unfriendly. Still, I got a camera, not a micro tablet. I can see some real potential in camera apps, especially with built in Wi-Fi that allows you to control your camera from your phone or tablet. They just won't be as easy to use with the NEX 6.The NEX 6 is an excellent camera, though it costs more than some DSLRs. My biggest problem with recommending it is the limited line of NEX lenses. Sony hasn't gotten the idea that cameras are no better than their lenses. There are about as many Sony NEX camera models as Sony lenses for them. That's the main reason, other than price, why I'm only giving 4 stars. On the other hand, third party lens makers are now making NEX lenses and Zeiss has promised some autofocus NEX lenses in '13. There's also the fact that Sony's focus peaking makes manual focusing very easy and adaptors allow you to put almost any kind of APS or full frame lens on a NEX camera. So this is a good camera that faces good competition. I like it because it feel right in my hands, takes great photos and is small and light.", "Date": "November 6, 2012"}, {"Title": "Amazing little camera, no regrets", "Author": "J Park", "ReviewID": "R343IE45WS0CO5", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "First off I want to preface this by saying that I'm an amateur photographer who's looking to get better but understands what a good picture looks like.  But at the end of the day I get more satisfaction in capturing a good moment, an image that I can look at later and remember that moment and not worry about having CA or higher levels of noise, or even if the image is slightly under/over exposed.  I'm not a pixel peeper and could honestly care less if there's a little noise when there's a 100% crop.  I don't go around looking at my images at 100% crop often, do you?  So if you're looking for a review that you can relate to on my level, then read on.I remember reading somewhere where a camera is only as good as the one you have with you.  Like most men do it seems, when I got an itch to buy a camera, my journey started.  When it's something that we don't really care about like clothes, we just buy the color and size we want.  But if something that interests us, the whole doctorate research project starts.  I had experience with a dSLR in the past so naturally I looked there.  After many weeks of reading countless forums, reviews, rumor sites, etc I had decided on the Nikon D600.  Was it overkill for my needs?  Of course but I naturally needed the biggest, most shiny new toy and if it was expensive, so be it and I rationalized my purchase.  I ended up receiving a camera that was a returned item and not new like I thought it was.  I had the chance to go more reasonble this time but I even went a step farther and added another couple of bucks and went for the Canon 5D MarkIII.  Don't get me wrong it was a fantastic camera and I really enjoyed it.  But I am a professional photographer who makes his living off taking pictures?  No, and I started having a hard time justifying having a close to $4,000 camera that I would shoot on the weekends and maybe a handful more times a month.  So back to square one.It was at this time that I received the most exciting news of my life.  We were expecting our first child.  So even more so I felt the need to act financially responsible.  And the thought of having to juggle a heavy dSLR body, a zoom lens, a few prime lenses, etc with a baby and all the gear that a baby comes with made be worry.  So it was almost by accident that I re-stumbled upon the whole mirrorless setup.  I had remembered seeing them in a magazine once but I put them off as just another gimmick or a larger P&S.;  I was actually at the store going to hold a few more dSLRs and trying to decide which one to try next.  Again like I seem to always do, I walked right over to the most expensive mirrorless camera there (NEX-7) and convinced myself and my wife that this was it, I was going to get the NEX-7.  I played with it at the store, asked questions, took some shots, messed around with it for another 30 minutes or so and left convinced that I was set. I thought to myself 'This is my next camera'.  I thought that I could shoot huge 24mp files, crop out what I didn't need.  That the Tri-Navi setup was essential to my future success of taking good pictures.  Funny thing though I got home, read some more posts, reviews, etc, and while all the reviews were generally positive, there were some other things that came up.  First came the posts saying that maybe the 24mp sensor was overkill or not as sharp.  That the dials shifted too easily.  That it had focusing issues and was not good in low light.  That it was a hassle to change modes.  So for all the complaints that appeared it seemed like Sony listened to all of these 'issues', correct them, and put out the NEX-6.So onto my thoughts of the NEX-6.What I like- Nice solid feel, really good grip.  I had looked at the Canon EOS-M and the absence of a quality grip was a huge turnoff.  Nevermind the fact that it just looks like a P&S.;- Love the mode dial.  Doesn't have a lock but doesn't need one.  You have to apply just the right amount of force to turn it.- Love the dial underneath, makes changing aperture in A mode easy.- Really love the EVF.  Is it grainy at times?  Sure, but I really like seeing how my image is going to turn out ahead of time with the changes in exposure prior to hitting the shutter.- Really love that the Fn button actually only needs one press to bring up the 6 sub-menus that you assign.  I noticed with the NEX-7 you have to repeatedly press the Fn button to scroll through your customized sub-menus.- Very well thought out built-in flash.  It allows you to manually bounce the flash.  I found it perfectly acceptable for indoor use.  Instead of a harsh flash hitting the subject and getting the dreaded P&S; type image, you can pull back the flash with your index finger, press the shutter with your middle finger, and get a really nice image.- Smaller file size works out well.  Again going back to my buying overkill I bought a 32GB SD card.  I can store over 1,300 RAW+JPEGs on it.- Pancake zoom performs better than I thought.  You read many complaints about shooting at the widest.  I haven't noticed it, but if I do start to notice it I'll just shoot at 18 instead of 16 and take two steps back.- Built-in wifi and apps.  I don't think I'll be using too many of the apps (outside of the picture style), but good to know that it's there.What I don't like- First I don't like that the pancake zoom lens uses a 40.5mm filter.  Why?  Because on the 2nd day of shooting I lost the cap while shooting in the park.  Silly me I thought I'll just buy a replacement one.  But since it appears that Sony isn't releasing this lens by itself until January there are no OEM caps available now.  So I had a choice of getting a Nikon cap to put on my Sony lens or get a generic $0.95 one, guess which way I went?- The inability to apply all settings to all modes.  Auto ISO doesn't work in M mode.  That's fine.  Picture styles will only apply to JPEG's, that's fine.  But I don't like having to change from RAW+JPEG to just JPEG mode if I want to apply a picture style.  I would've liked being able to stay in RAW+JPEG mode and only have the effect applied to the JPEG file while being able to capture the RAW file.- Shutter button is grey.Wow, if the 3rd thing that I don't like is that the shutter is grey, what does that tell you about how little that I have to nitpick about the camera?  Could the camera be better with a longer lasting battery?  Sure why not, but it's not just Sony that has a shorter life on the battery.  Every manufacturer seems to have a 200-400 shot duration on a single battery.  Which makes me wonder with all the advancements in technology, why not have a camera/cell phone battery that lasts for more than a day between charges?  All the reviews that I've read seem to agree with me.  Everything is mostly positive, I read one reviewer that listed the cons as not having a touchscreen and not having a fully 180 degree articulating screen.  Yes, but we knew going in that the camera didn't have these features.  So the con isn't performance related but spec related.  But that's like saying this Honda Accord doesn't have a 400hp engine so it's a con and you're disappointed that it doesn't.  But you knew before you bought the car what the specsheet said it had and didn't have.  So there wasn't a con about the lack of speed in the autofocus (EOS-M). Another complaint is the lack of lenses in the NEX lineup right now.  Even if you don't want to buy adapters and get older MF lenses, the ones that are out right now are pretty solid.  You have a 10-18 wide angle zoom, a 16 f/2.8, a standard 50mm, you have a great Zeiss lens, you have a pancake zoom, and you have the upcoming 35 f/1.8, a 55-210 zoom, and a all-in-one 18-200.  The only glaring hole is a 85 or so prime.  And you have Zeiss committing to at least 3 new lenses next year, and Sony with a solid roadmap of upcoming lenses.  I actually like that there aren't 100's of lenses out there, it makes me buying one at a time easier on my wallet.After shooting with the camera for the better part of a week I'll be honest and I had a little bit of buyer's remorse.  I thought to myself 'Why didn't I pay the extra few hundred for the NEX-7?'  So I just came back from the store where I held the NEX-7, shot with it, etc, and did all the things that I did a few weeks ago.  But for some reason it didn't feel the same.  I didn't have the same sense of 'Wow this is my next camera'.  I liked having all the submenus come up when I pressed the Fn once and not have to repeatedly press it.  I liked having the mode dials that stuck in place instead of having the dials that may move freely on it's own.  And I liked having a movie record button that was a little less easy to tap and being able to use it when I wanted to and not having to fully disable it like the new firmware addressed.  And I liked having the new kid on the block rather than a camera that's been out a year and seems destined to be replaced in the next 6 months or so.  The mirrorless camera segment seems to be moving much quicker than the dSLR market.  Whereas it seems like some dSLRs have been out for years with no replacement announced (Canon 7D since 2009, Nikon D7000 since 2010), it seems like the cycle on the mirrorless segment is every year to play catchup with the big brother on the block.  So will I look at the NEX-7n or whatever it's called when it's realized?  Of course.  Will I contemplate getting it or not getting it over and over again and drive my wife crazy asking for her opinion?  You bet.  But at least now I can sleep easy knowing that for my needs RIGHT NOW that I have the best camera for me.  I enjoy not having to think about framing each individual shot like I'm trying to create a masterpiece. I enjoy knowing that I can go out there with a camera that's easy to carry around and I can take 20 shots, 50 shots, or even 200 and I have confidence that I'll have some quality images in there.  Because at the end of the day, a camera is only as good as the one you have with you.", "Date": "November 26, 2012"}, {"Title": "Miracle in a Small Package", "Author": "I'm a PC...No, I'm a Mac", "ReviewID": "RI4YJ4FLT4SF", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "This review covers my experience over the last month with the Sony NEX-6 and kit 16-50mm lens. I have taken approximately 750 exposures with the camera, but only an hour or so of video.Quick Look:16MP APS-C sensor with 1.5x crop factor provides terrific image quality. Very short shutter lag, up to 10FPS. 16-50mm (24-75mm equiv.) kit lens is quite good considering its very small size. Small body + lens, fits in jacket pocket. Clear, responsive electronic viewfinder. Articulated, bright LCD. Accepts standard SD/SDHC/SDXC memory or Sony Memory Sticks.  Exposures are spot on. On camera flash is mounted high for red eye control and can be used as a bounce flash. Has a hot shoe to attach external flash. Fully automatic with many manual controls. More modes, from auto to manual, than anyone really needs. JPEG and RAW file support, RAW converter software included.Minuses: Short battery life. Battery charges in camera, external charger optional. New hot shoe still not ISO standard,with  few accessories available. Lens is not fast and not super sharp (but tiny - it's that pesky physics thing)Overall: A great second camera for a DSLR owner, or as a step up from a compact. It does not disappoint.------------------------------------------------I have been an amateur photographer for about 30 years. For the last few years I have been looking for a lighter carry-around camera for those times that I don't want to, or can't, carry the DSLR. I have tried compacts like the Canon S100/110, the Canon G series cameras, the Panasonic GX-1, and too many others to mention. All got used for a couple of days and returned because they were fatally flawed for one reason or another. Bad exposure, no flash, no viewfinder, poor stabilization, slow focus, poor in-camera jpeg processing, etc. But with the Nex-6 I think I have found my camera. Overall, it performs nearly as well as my Canon 7D DSLR. Please note this review considers only the camera and the kit 16-50mm lens; I have not yet purchased other E mount lenses for the camera, though I expect to and may update this review at that time.UnboxingThe package includes the camera, a robust strap, a lens cap, USB charge/data cable, AC power supply, NP-50 battery, CD with RAW processor and manual, and a printed quick start guide.Body. Memory, PowerThe camera is surprisingly small considering it contains an 16MP APS-C sensor, the same size as in many DSLRs. It fits well in the hand, and is just heavy enough to be stable in use. It has a very usable electronic viewfinder. In the past I found these to be blurry, slow, and hard to use, and they were a big reason I had not purchased a mirrorless system camera. But this one is a very usable replacement for an optical viewfinder and provides clarity and immediacy that, while not up to optical viewfinder standards, is certainly good enough. And an upside is that you can see the shot in the viewfinder after exposure, something you can't do with a DSLR. I always use the viewfinder as it allows me to hold the camera up to my eye, which is a much more stable position than holding it out in front and looking at the LCD. Of course you can use it that way, too. The viewfinder is also very visible in very bright sun while the LCD, like most others, struggles in direct sun though it performs very well otherwise. The LCD is articulated so you can fold it out and still see it with the camera high above your head or near the ground. This allows you to get shots that others miss. It is bright, colors are good, and its response rate is fast. It has a threaded tripod mount, but like many small cameras it is not in line with the lens axis - it's off to the side - so taking panoramas with a tripod is more complicated. The NEX-6 has built-in Wifi for moving photos to Facebook, etc. I did not use the Wifi features so I can't comment on how effective it is. Power is provided by a NP-50 battery and this is a minor downside - battery life is relatively short, so buy an extra if you plan to do a day of shooting. Another minor nit is that Sony does not include an external charger, so the battery must be charged in-camera which means that you can't use the camera while the second battery is charging. Sony sells an external charger, but it is very slow (8.2V @ 280 mA, ~4 hours). I purchased the cheaper Pearstone NP-FW50 (about $20, AC or 12V DC power, 8.2V @ 500 mA) which charges the battery about twice as fast. The camera takes standard SD/SDHC/SDXC memory cards, and it also accepts Sony Memory Stick cards.ControlsThe controls are easy to get to, and while the camera lacks the touch screen of the NEX-7 I do not view this as any sort of deficit. Most controls you use on a regular basis are physical knobs or buttons, or are easily accessed via the Function menu and its 5 way controller. The camera has two multi-purpose dials, one on the back of the camera which also serves as a 5-way control switch, and one under the mode switch on the top of the camera. These allow simultaneous access to, for example, Aperture and Shutter settings in manual mode. The flash, ISO, and exposure adjustment controls are all easily accessible, and there is a dedicated button to start and stop video regardless of whatever other mode you happen to be in. There are also two \"soft\" buttons next to the LCD whose function changes, with the current function displayed on the LCD next to each button. The on-off switch is under the shutter release, and the camera powers up quickly.FlashThe built in flash is rated ~GN20 (feet, ISO100). Its power is more typical of a DSLR pop-up flash than a compact one. It performs in excess of what you might expect, in part due to the camera's good low light performance. It is articulated and spring loaded so it pops up when you press the flash release button on the back of the camera, and when you are done you push it down and it locks in place. This mechanism looks robust and reliable, and it positions the flash center well above the center of the lens which prevents red-eye at typical portrait distances. Also, since it is spring loaded you can pull it back and use it as a bounce flash at any angle from horizontal to well beyond horizontal (pointing at the ceiling). If you have a neutral ceiling to bounce off of, bounce flash provides evenly lit, well balanced exposures without that deer-in-the-headlights look. This is possibly the feature that most separates this camera from its rivals, since it is difficult-to-impossible to get quality images from most built in flashes. The camera also has a hot shoe for mounting an external flash. It is a new ISO-sized  (but not standard) hot shoe called a \"multi-interface shoe\". It is supposed to replace the zoo of non-standard and confusing flash, light, and microphone mounts Sony has used on its cameras and camcorders in the past. It has a row of pins under the front of the shoe that will eventually allow the connection of on-camera microphones, on-camera lights, flashes, and other accessories via this hot shoe. So far the only accessories that are compatible with the new shoe is a $550 combo flash/video light and an $800 dual XLR microphone adapter that are both designed for the new Alpha a99 DSLR but will work with this camera. Sony does offer a hot shoe adapter, part ADP-MAA ($25), which allows you to mount any Sony Alpha-compabile flash designed for the auto lock shoe used on its DSLR cameras. However, unless you need to throw light more than 3-5m, the on-camera flash is adequate.ModesToo many to list. Seriously. It has face detect, panorama, portrait, sports, auto HDR, you name it. The smart auto mode does everything for you, and does it pretty well. It also has the creative modes more typical of a DSLR - PASM (Program, Aperture Priority, Shutter Priority, Manual). Whether you want automation or control, it's available. The camera is usable for capturing moving items as well, something that compacts can't do. It will fire at 3FPS for 10-15 frames depending on settings. It also has a \"Speed Priority\" mode that locks exposure and focus, which can take 10 frames per second.Focus and StabilizationWith the kit lens, the camera focuses insanely fast for a non-DSLR, and it even performs well in low light. I have not yet had it hunt for focus in normal room light. As far as I can tell, the lens focuses where it is supposed to, though the slowness of the lens allows a lot of wiggle room for the focus point. The stabilizer also works well. I have successfully taken acceptably sharp handheld shots in normal room light at shutter speeds as low as 1/8 with the lens set around 25mm (40mm equiv). I am not a particular stable handheld photographer, so this represents about 2-1/2 stops slower than what i can do without the stabilizer. Of course, your determination of \"acceptably sharp\" may vary from mine, as will your stability.Kit LensThough the 16-50mm (24-75 equiv) 3.5-5.6 kit pancake lens is not critically sharp nor particularly fast, it is surprising how good it is given its size. Its pocketability makes these issues a reasonable tradeoff, I think. It far exceeds the sharpness of the Panasonic G X VARIO PZ 14-42 lens I previously tried on a Panasonic GX1. And the size of this lens means the camera fits in a jacket pocket or a small belt pack, something that can't be done with any DSLR or even most other mirrorless cameras with similar focal length zoom lenses. This lens does suffer from fairly severe vignetting, but this is entirely and satisfactorily corrected in-camera for jpegs, and also by Sony's (and Adobe's) RAW processors. And the zoom range, 24-75mm equiv., is just about perfect for the work that I do, much of it indoors in cramped spaces. One downside of the Sony system is that there are few E mount lenses available, and fewer good ones. 4/3 system camera owners have a far better choice of lenses. I am hoping this will change over time, as the NEX line fills out.Image QualityOverall, image quality is extremely good, with results that can easily be printed to Super-B (13\"x19\"). The jpeg engine does a good job with exposure, color correction, and removing many of the lens artifacts such as vignetting. RAW files are also great, and as with all cameras I am able to get better results from the RAW files. Unfortunately, if you are an Adobe user you will need Lightroom 4 or Photoshop CS6 to be able to manage these RAW files - the versions of Camera Raw that work with CS5 and Lightroom 3 (and earlier) won't support this camera. Low light performance is extremely good. Jpegs up to ISO 800 look great direct out of camera, and even ISO1600 jpegs are usable, depending on what \"usable\" means to you. If you process the images RAW, you can get very usable images to ISO3200, or even ISO6400 for smaller non-critical images (think Facebook).VideoI have not taken a lot of video with this camera, so take this with a grain of salt. Image quality is about what you would expect with this lens, which is to say it's OK but not much better than a midrange consumer camcorder. Both autofocus and power zoom work while recording video, and while the zoom is quiet, you can hear it in the recording. The camera records in full HD 1920x1080 at 60 fps and 24 fps. It also records HD 1440x1080 at 30 fps with rectangular pixels, compatible with older (ie, tape based HDV) systems. For web and DVD use you can record in SD as well, 640x480 at 30 fps. The camera has built in stereo microphones which do a reasonably good job, but Sony elected to leave out the external mic jack that is on the NEX-7. That is a pity, since it is hard to get decent video at any distance with the built in mics, nor can you add wind shields and such. The camera has a wind noise filter but like most, it affects the audio you want, not just the wind noise you don't want. The hot shoe has contacts for an external mic, but so far none are available. The only existing option is the $800 adapter that brings out two XLR mic jacks, which is obviously overkill for this camera. A hot shoe to stereo 1/8\" mini-jack adapter would be a great thing. Are you listening, Sony?In ClosingIf you are looking for a pocketable mirrorless interchangeable lens camera, my opinion is that you can't go wrong with the NEX-6. It's not perfect, but the inevitable tradeoffs required to build a high quality camera that fits in your pocket were, I think, mostly the right ones.Edit 5/16/2013: In my original review I claimed the camera has GPS, which is does not. I'm not sure how that error crept in, but in any case, I'm sorry for any confusion. Also, the review claimed there was no compatible external mic available for the NEX-6. That has changed and you can now get the ECM-XYST1M which attaches via the new hot shoe. I bought one about two weeks ago. It is a stereo microphone with positionable mic elements that can be set at 120 degrees for wide coverage, or 0 degrees for tighter coverage. It is not as good as a shotgun (ie, Rode Videomic) for recording far away sounds such as a stage performance, but it is still a significant upgrade over the built-in mics. It is available now, for about $150.", "Date": "January 3, 2013"}, {"Title": "Great little camera. Hits the sweet-spot.", "Author": "delbarcelona", "ReviewID": "R3V3B6TBC3LN3H", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I received the camera about a week ago and I'm really enjoying it. Previously owned a Canon DSLR, but about a year ago realized that I wasn't using it as much due to size and decided to get my first NEX (5N). I was immediately blown away by the image quality (with just the kit lens). One of the few thinks I didn't like about the 5N was the lack of focus accuracy on moving subjects. After debating for some time between the NEX 5R and the 6 finally decided to order the 6.Although the viewfinder was not the reason I opted for the 6, I have to admit that I like it a lot. I use it all the time; even to review images as they look much better (they have a really cool 3D look!).I'm happy to report that Autofocus is significantly faster than it was on the 5N. It is for still subjects, but especially for moving subjects.The menu layout is very similar to that of the 5N (and every NEX), which is not terrible but sometimes requires a little more digging than one would like. However, the inclusion of several external controls makes a big difference in accessing some of the most commonly used settings and adjustments. Especially the mode-dial and the control wheel right below. There is also an autoexposure lock button that you can use for that purpose, as well as re-program it to control over 20 other settings!In my opinion, the whole experience of the user interface and controls layout is absolutely delightful and a real pleasure to use. It gives me that wow factor and makes me look forward to using it.The kit zoom is more than adequate and takes very good pictures. If you understand what it is and don't expect the performance of a $1,000+ lens you should be satisfied. I'm planning to get more lenses in the near future, but for now I'm happy with the images it produces.Wi-fi is a pretty cool feature to have. I can transfer pictures to my Android or ipad from anywhere. The camera creates its own wi-fi network and the mobile device connects to it. It has always worked for me.Some of the thinks I like the most:*Perfect size, viewfinder, external dials, excellent grip, built in (**tiltable**) flash, great image quality, size of the kit lens, wi-fi.I would also like to share my personal opinion about some of the thinks some people have complained about:*No external charger: I love having the option of being able to use the camera to charge the battery (if needed) with any micro-USB charger (cellphone car-charger for example). Before, the only option was the external charger. I purchased an external charger with two batteries for around $30 and they work flawless. No difference from the original.*Removing the memory card: I don't really get that one. Seriously; I can remove the memory card without even looking at the compartment so I don't really know what they are talking about.*Battery life: I guess that can be a little subjective, but all I can say based on my experience, is that I'm getting better battery life than with the 5N. Considering the fact that they use the same battery, no complaints here whatsoever.The one think I'm not very thrilled about is that the flash button is mechanical and is a little hard to press. You almost have to use the nail.Overall, I really like the camera. I think it has a lot of potential and I'm planning to keep it for a while.I will update the review with more relevant observations when I have more hands-on time.

For me it's the technology that gets me - I know that the pictures I take will suck, so it's fun to blame the camera and search for one  that will let me take better blurry pictures of my kids :)Anyway, the Sony NEX 6 is a very nice camera compared to many of the others I listed above.  The size is great - a nice, solid grip on it to keep a hold of (as compared to the X100 which was tough to handle).  The kit lens feels solid (although it SOUNDS cheap - the innards make a rattling noise that is a bit of a concern).  The viewfinder is GREAT - out of all of the cameras I have used recently, this viewfinder is the one I like the most.  I don't mind an EVF if it's a good one.  The OM-D has a similar viewfinder, but centered on the camera for no good reason.  Sony got smart and stuck it on the edge of the camera, so you aren't wiping you nose all over the main LCD screen...Image quality is nice - I like that it handles high-ISO images fairly nicely.  It's a bit of a concern to me how quickly it will jump up to ISO 3200 on indoor shots.  On my last camera - a Canon 60D, anything above about ISO 1600 showed a lot of noise - so seeing the Sony take a picture at ISO 3200 in 'Auto' mode is strange.  But the images don't show too much noise - definitely better than the Canon.  I do wish you could set an ISO ceiling however like you can on the X100.My only real gripe with the camera, aside from the rattling feeling of the kit lens, and the strange charger (it plugs into the camera vs. removing the battery from the camera to charge), is the user interface.  Basically, it's poor.  If you want 'settings' for the camera, you wade through all hundred-ish settings in one long list.  Pause on an item to figure out what it means, and a pop-up window is displayed that covers up how the value is set.  So assuming you can find the option you want, you can either see what it means, or see how it is set currently, but not both at the same time :)  The whole interface on the screen is just goofy and kludgy compared to other cameras.  Another example is that one of the rear buttons is mapped to 'Wifi' most of the time - to transmit pictures.  But for something so rarely used, it seems strange to map it this way by default...As a separate rant, the iPad 'PlayMemories' app that you are supposed to use for a lot of the wifi functionality is absolutely garbage.  If the camera isn't set up to transmit when you launch the app, the pop-up message on the iPad is \"Error - Search the shooting device from the network setting of the terminal and set it.\"  The grammar problems are courtesy of Sony, not me.  What the heck is the 'terminal' when you are dealing with an iPad and a camera?  And what do you set it to?  The software and camera appear to only support direct connections via wifi - so if you have your iPad on your local wireless, and your camera on the local wireless - they can't see each other.  You need to put the camera in broadcasting mode and switch the wireless on the iPad to use the camera as the access point.  I managed to get this to connect once - it ran for about 2 minutes, then crashed and wouldn't reconnect.  Yeah!So, don't buy the NEX-6 for the wifi functionality or the 'apps' in my mind - buy it because it's a nice camera body with a good feel and a big sensor that handles low light well.  Tolerate the crappy UI, and ignore the wireless :)Hope this helps!", "Date": "December 19, 2012"}, {"Title": "A transformational platform for digital photography", "Author": "Medical Marketing Maven", "ReviewID": "R3V64XMCQZEZUH", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "There are many fine reviews here on Amazon for the NEX-6. I won't duplicate them. My review is about the world of lenses that the NEX-6 opens - a world most of you trapped in a Canon or Nikon or Sony DSLR world have never known.I bought the NEX-6 because for almost 20 years, I've been looking at my Leica glass - a 35mm f1.4 Summilux, a 50mm f2 Summicron. and a 90mm f2.8 Tele-Elmarit - and wishing for a digital body I could justify buying that could tap them. I also have an orphaned group of excellent Canon FD glass, including an 85mm f1.2L and a 24mm f2. For my professionally used D7000s, I have the range from the 11-16mm f2.8 from Tokina to the 80-200 f2.8 Nikon - both AF and manual focus.When I saw the NEX-6, I suspected my quest was over. The EVF is a knockout - imagine a classic Leica rangefinder window with a grainless focusing screen, and you picture looking through the NEX-6. I ordered the camera with the 16-50mm kit lens, and adapters for my Leica, Canon FD and Nikon glass. A few hours after it arrived, and I had minimally charged the near-dead battery it came with, I knew my quest was over.The kit lens is better than I hoped, and yet, not a great lens. Like all kit lenses, it's a compromise. The corner vignetting at 16mm is quite pronounced, as is the barrel distortion. You can correct the distortion in Photoshop quite easily; you can minimize the vignetting a bit, too. Otherwise, it's just a rather slow kit lens, valuable for walk-around shooting when you don't expect to shoot a cover for National Geographic. It's not as bad as you fear.However...the \"lens focus\" of my review:The NEX-6, with adapters, accepts just about every piece of glass except the bottom of a Coke bottle. The Leica glass blows the doors off any inexpensive glass designed for pocketable mirrorless cameras (yes, the Summilux needs to be shot at f4 to become great). And because they are rangefinder lenses. they are darn near as small as kit lenses. I bought the Leica lenses in 1983-1989, used, at prices that would make you weep today ($325 for the Summilux from a Frankfurt camera store - $2500 today). Combined with the kit 16-50mm lens, the NEX and 3 Leica lenses all fit in 2 large pockets.I have fallen in love again with my 24mm f2 Canon FD. On the NEX-6, it's brilliant - the images even at f2 are rich. That NEX-6 sensor is sweet. I just got the Photoshop Elements 11, and Adobe Camera RAW 7.3 does a gorgeous job with the RAW images.While it rather dwarfs the NEX-6, my 11-16 Tokina is brilliant on the NEX-6, just as on the D7000. Should I choose to compete for the geek of the year award, I could purchase an adapter and attach the giant Hasselblad 500mm f8 Carl Zeiss Tele-Tessar I inherited from my father.I see discussions here on the merits of different lens options for the NEX-6, especially zooms. Though I have never seen the 18-200mm zoom for the NEX-6, I note it weighs 1.5 lbs, the same as my Nikon 18-200mm. For what it costs, you can buy a lot of 35mm manual-focus primes and even zooms with similar apertures or better - and since you'll be using just the central \"sweet spot\" of those lenses, arguably getting better results than from a lens designed for an APS-C sensor.Thus, the real fun of the NEX-6 goes beyond the limitations of the auto-everything E-mount lenses.There are tons of fine Canon FD and Konica and other good film glass available cheaply on Craig's List and even eBay if you shop carefully. You can pick up a Canon FD 50mm f1.8 lens for under $20, an adapter for under $20, and shoot your NEX-6 indoors at ISO 100, and blow the doors off any kit lens. I saw Konica lenses for less than $10. People sell for peanuts or give away jammed film cameras with perfectly good lenses. Virtually all will optically match or outperform kit lenses costing 20X more. And because they all have effective apertures 2-4 times larger than kit lenses, you'll be shooting ISO 100 when those with the kits are shooting 800-3200. Or handholding when they need a tripod.No, those old lenses won't autofocus, and no, they're not image stabilized. But set to P (program), the NEX-6 picks a perfect exposure for whatever the aperture of your lens. And if you can't focus properly or zone focus, or hand hold or brace properly a camera without stabilization, you aren't a real photographer in my book.Stop dawdling. You know you want it.

However, the NEX-6 does have a multi-shot auto noise reduction that can help offset the the noise when taking static images in low light (the resulting images do have a processed look, but at least it is an option, one you don't get with the Nikon 5200).The NEX-6 with the 16-50mm motorized, auto-collapsing zoom is compact enough to fit in a coat pocket, has wi-fi image transfer to your mobile device, optional remote control with image preview on your mobile device, a partially articulated screen, auto HDR and handles fairly quickly. I like taking high and low angle shots, so the partially articulated screen is something I really use a lot. The screen isn't as useful as the fully articulated screen on the Nikon D5200, but it is better than not having one at all, which is the case with the Fuji EX-1.The optional visible focus peaking feature makes manual focusing easy. It causes high contrast areas presumed to be \"in focus\" to show up as a lived colored overlay. It is basically a human readable version of how the camera does auto focus using contrast detection, and it's a near must have for using a camera with an electronic viewfinder with manual focus. It is also one of the reasons I chose the NEX-6 over the Fuji. I need help with focusing using an EVF. The NEX has it. The Fuji doesn't.The 16mm lens is wider than any of the Nikon APS-C kit lenses, and as sharp or sharper on the wide end than any of them- and way, way sharper than the wide end of the Nikon 18-200mm super zoom I was considering.On the other hand, the camera was buggy, with the kit lens constantly resetting as the camera claimed not not recognize the lens. Lost lots of good shots that way. Really irritating. The bracketing function cannot be triggered by remote control or by the self timer because bracketing, remote control and self timer release features are \"drive modes\", and thus mutually exclusive. The camera takes a while to boot up - the powered, collapsing lens also has to boot and extend. Not a good grab shot camera.The fact that the camera can't do Auto HDR while in RAW mode is annoying. You have to dig into the menu to turn off RAW, then dig into another menu to turn on Auto HDR, and then the reverse when you are done. I realize the processed image wouldn't be in RAW, of course, but I'd like the option to have the camera process an HDR image even if the unprocessed exposures are in RAW.Overall, I've been happy with the camera, but a DSLR handles quicker, and the fully articulated screen on a Nikon D5200 would have been really useful for all the ceiling fresco shots I took from a medium sized Gorilla Pod. The compact size of the camera let me take the camera and the medium Gorilla Pod places a big DSLR with a big zoom on a big Gorilla Pod might have gotten me outed from. But I missed a number of shots due to camera bugs when the camera refused to recognize the lens, and due to the so-so boot time of the camera.Pros:* Coat pocketable with collapsing 16-50mm kit lens, with a decent sized coat pocket - good for being inconspicuous when you aren't taking photos.* Low shutter lag* Mechanical shutter prevents rolling shutter artifacts* Phase and contrast focusing* Visible focus peaking makes manual focusing easy - very, very useful* Automatic electronic zoom for critical focusing - very useful* Histogram available live and for stored images* RAW format option* RAW format and kit lens compatible with Adobe Lightroom 4 and above* High resolution Electronic View Finder lets you compose photos even in bright sunlight* Partially articulated screen on back of the camera lets you compose low angle shots without having to lie down on the ground* Works with inexpensive 3-d party infrared remotes* Large APS-C sensor* Noise is comparable or better to APS-C DSLRs like the Nikon 5200* Built in multi-frame noise reduction - works great for static photos in dim places you can't use a flash like museums.* Built in HDR* 3-Frame Bracketing up to 3 EV apart* Wi-Fi upload to mobile device works well, handy for sharing vacation shots. Automatically creates a WiFi hotspot for your mobile device to connect to so you don't have to be near a WiFi network, and converts both JPEG and RAW format shots to low res images JPEG for transfer. Lets you preview and pick which ones to transfer on your mobile device.* Optional mobile device remote control with remote image preview works pretty well.* 16mm (24mm equivalent) wide angle end of zoom is really useful for getting everything you want in frame* Kit lens is as sharp or sharper than Nikon 18-55mm kit lens* What you see is what you get. When you stop down to smaller apertures the camera actually stops down during preview--unlike a DSLR which always composes with the aperture wide open. This is good and bad, good for previewing depth of field, but annoying when you want to be sure something will be in focus or the center of the depth of field - thus you have to manually open the aperture, focus, then stop down and check your depth of field.* Fast 10 fps continuous shooting mode.* Good ergonomics on the grip - easy to hold on to.* Flash doesn't automatically pop up - it does not go off when you don't want it to, which is really good for museums and events where flash is not allowed.Cons****There is no way to remote trigger bracketed shots**** I use bracketing on long exposure shots on a portable tripod. It is critical not to touch the camera to keep the image sharp. Sony has made the remote and the bracketing feature both \"drive modes\", so they are mutually exclusive. The optional remote control app doesn't solve this problem as it doesn't trigger bracketing even if you have the drive mode set to bracing, though you can manually change the exposure using the remote control app 1/3 EV at a time(a slow, laborious process that waits for the camera to send a preview of the exposure change with each 1/3 EV change as you are loosing light at twilight). This is a serious, inexcusable problem that really makes the camera a lot less useful to me.* Kit lens kept resetting, with the camera claiming not to recognize the lens, causing the lens to collapse and lose all settings. Not cool. Lost lots of good shots because of this constant problem.* Partially articulated screen only works for horizontally (\"landscape\") composed shots - because the screen has only one axis of articulation, it is useless for high or low angle shots with the camera composed for vertical or \"portrait\" compositions.* Collapsible kit lens takes time to expand when the camera powers up. The power up time is too slow to make a good grab shot camera. (A DSLR can compose shots even when it is \"off\" since the optical viewfinder is not dependent on power. A non-collapsing lens would make the NEX-6 bigger, but faster to use.)* Mechanical shutter makes noise. Wound up using my cell phone when I needed to be totally silent. Should have a no-mechanical shutter feature for quiet shooting--which we know it can do since it can take HD Movies without using the mechanical shutter for each shot.* Automatic electronic zoom for focusing no custom user-settable off time - stays on longer or shorter than I'd like* Automatic HDR mode only saves the normal exposure and the HDRed image, not the bracketed shots, so you can't do your own HDR from the exposures.* Automatic HDR mode doesn't work when the camera is set to RAW or RAW + JPEG* WiFi Transfer option is not available in playback mode - weirdly you have to switch to shooting mode to be able to turn on the WiFi image transfer mode* WiFi transfer mode does not let you choose between low res or full res transfers* No GPS* No touch screen* Battery charge is very slow--280 minutes--and has to be charged in-camera. There is no external charger from Sony to let you charge a spare battery.* Camera cannot charge and operate at the same time and you cannot power the camera with the USB/charging cable, only charge the battery or connect to your computer.* No way to turn the camera on in to just playback mode - which means the camera *always* extends the lens when you turn it on, even when you just want to look at images or transfer via WiFi.* Optional mobile device remote control app doesn't let you adjust anything but exposure +/- and has long shutter lag* Very dark vignetting in the image corners in the uncorrected RAW files of the 16-50mm kit lens - the vignetting would be considered unacceptable in a film camera, though correctable in camera and in Lightroom.* Viewfinder goes dark during every shot of the 10 fps continuous shooting mode like a DSLR, makes it a bit tough to follow the action - Easier just to switch to HD Movie mode and take the resolution hit.* Flash is not centered over the lens. I really prefer the flash shadow to fall straight back to make it less obtrusive. The camera does have a centered hot shoe, though, so you can use an external flash.* Lack of full range, native lenses. You can adapt manual focus lenses to the camera, but the range of full-featured, native lenses is limited. And the available16mm pancake lens is mediocre rather than excellent as a prime should be.", "Date": "June 9, 2013"}, {"Title": "Extremely good... but not great", "Author": "Jason M. Stone \"UX Designer\"", "ReviewID": "R1P5SPQ4F801XV", "Overall": "3.0", "Content": "Since everyone's needs and expectations from a camera are different, a word about who I am. I'm what one might call a photography enthusiast. I bought my first digital camera (a 1 megapixel HP Photosmart C30, which I find absolutely hilarious now) in 1998 and my first DSLR (a Canon EOS-D60) in 2002. At one point, I went hog wild, spending thousands and thousands of dollars on a Canon EOS-1D Mark II N and several of Canon's high-end 'L' lenses, studio lighting, backdrops, the whole nine yards. Over time, life got too busy, and I sold off all of my photography gear and downgraded to an entry-level Canon DSLR (the T1i) for casual shooting. I also have a Sony HX9V travel zoom, which I love for its convenience, but which is obviously hampered by a very small sensor.Recently, however, I became reacquainted with my love for photography, and decided to really start devoting some time to it. Since I was last paying attention, there's been a great deal of movement in the mirrorless ILC space, which I found very intriguing. The idea of a highly compact camera with interchangeable lenses, boasting DSLR image quality seemed wonderful. I pored over the reviews and in the end, decided the Sony NEX-6 was the right choice for me. My hope was that this camera would be able to take the place of my DSLR.I struggled with how to proceed with this review and with the rating I'd give the NEX-6, because the truth is, it's capable of some truly wonderful shots. The weekend before last (Memorial Day weekend), I took at trip to Utah to visit Canyonlands and Arches National Parks, and I left my DSLR behind and brought only the NEX-6 to see if it would be up to the challenge.Part of me feels guilty for giving the NEX-6 a three-star rating, when I was absolutely satisfied with the image quality. But there's more to using a camera than just the final output.WHAT I LIKED+ Image Quality: The Sony NEX-6 has an APS-C size sensor, which gives it parity with any entry- and most mid-level DSLRs. While many of those DSLRs have higher megapixel counts, it's important to note that the NEX-6's fairly middle-of-the-road 16 megapixels means that the sensor's pixel density theoretically allows for better low-light performance than a comparably-sized (APS-C) sensor with a greater megapixel specification. For my part, I was shooting exclusively in bright outdoor settings at extremely low ISO, and generally not at wide-open apertures -- it's certainly true that I wasn't putting too many demands on the camera in terms of image quality, but I was nevertheless pleasantly surprised at the results I got. I shoot only in RAW and do my post-processing in Lightroom 4, and while I was shooting in pretty much ideal conditions, I was thrilled with the color, detail and dynamic range of the shots.+ Size: The only lens I had was the 16-50mm kit lens (roughly 25-80mm equivalent), which is a very compact lens. When mounted, the entire camera is extremely light. This is a plus, but it's also a minus (see below).+ Autofocus: Again, I was shooting in bright, ideal conditions, but the autofocus was extremely responsive. I also really appreciated the ability to manually override the autofocus (which automatically zooms in the display for even more precision). Also loved the focus peaking option -- more cameras should have that.+ Articulating Rear Display: Extremely convenient being able to tilt the rear display up or down, allowing for unusual camera angles.WHAT I DIDN'T LIKE- Size: I know I also listed this as a plus, but it's not without its downsides. The camera is so small that, despite a seemingly excellent build quality, it feels fragile and insubstantial compared to a DSLR. The camera doesn't sit well in my hands as a result of its diminutive size. And from a purely psychological standpoint, when you're surrounded by people carrying large, intimidating-looking DSLRs, you feel like a rank amateur. (I realize that last point is completely stupid, but I did honestly feel inadequate on a couple of occasions, like I was trekking around with a cheap point-and-shoot.)- Controls: As a UX designer, I recognize that there's a balancing act between giving users immediate access to as many controls/settings as possible... and keeping the user interface as simple as possible. The NEX-6's controls lean toward the side of simplicity (when compared to a DSLR, at least). That would be fine if the camera were aiming to conquer the point-and-shoot segment, but (ostensibly) it's trying to steal ground from the DSLR market, where more advanced features need to be as close to the surface as possible. I found myself frequently frustrated by having to dive into Sony's ridiculously convoluted menu system for things that I could access much more quickly on my DSLR.- EVF: The electronic viewfinder has gotten a great deal of praise for being a wonderful example of the technology. However, for my part, I think the technology is crap. This may be an excellent execution of the electronic viewfinder, but I still found it extremely difficult to use in the very bright desert environment. It was simply not bright enough. There were several occasions where I had to use my left hand to further cup around the eyepiece and my eye to block the sunlight in order to see anything in the viewfinder. The other problem with an EVF has to do with dynamic range and contrast. An electronic display, no matter how good, is not able to match the abilities of the human eye. Once the \"wow, gee whiz\" factor of the EVF wore off, I found myself missing the optical viewfinder of my DSLR. (And the rear LCD, in direct sunlight, is completely useless.)- Battery Life: Some of the reviews I read listed excellent battery life as a pro for the NEX-6. Perhaps my expectations were too high, but I was sorely disappointed with the battery life. I wasn't able to get through an entire day of shooting on a single charge, something I wouldn't have even thought twice about with my DSLR. I suppose that's the price you pay for that power-hungry EVF.- Sensor Dust: I had basically two full days of shooting. Halfway through the trip, the sensor acquired a number of dust particles which were visible on photos in smooth areas (like sky or solid surfaces). The specks weren't visible in the EVF or the rear LCD, so I had no idea it had happened until I saw them on the computer. It's correctable with Photoshop, but it's extremely labor intensive to do so and very disappointing. It's also somewhat surprising that it happened at all, since (as I mentioned) I only had the kit lens and I never actually removed it from the body. If it had been removed at any point, I could understand the introduction of dust on the sensor, but since that wasn't the case, it leaves a big question mark in my mind about the build. I don't believe Sony advertises the NEX-6 as environmentally sealed, but I don't recall it ever being windy or encountering any flying dust during the weekend either. The lens does telescope in and out during zooming, so it's possible it was sucked in that way. Still... disappointing.For someone coming from a point-and-shoot or compact camera, I think the NEX-6 would be a brilliant and worthy upgrade. From my perspective as an enthusiast who had hoped a mirrorless ILC like the NEX-6 would offer a compelling alternative to a DSLR, I just found it lacking in terms of usability and \"feel.\" The image quality, as I mentioned, was impressive during the trip... but I didn't enjoy *using* the camera very much.By the end of my trip, I'd decided to return the camera, which I've now done. I've decided to stick with DSLRs, though I did upgrade to the Canon 6D. At nearly three times the price (with the kit lens) and a full-frame sensor, it's hardly an apples-to-apples comparison, but I'm happy with the decision.The NEX-6 is capable of taking some stellar shots, but it seems to me that mirrorless ILC systems are not yet at a point where they offer a reasonable substitute for a more fully-featured DSLR. Someday, perhaps.

It does not do what a Nikon D4 does, but who would expect it to? I am a long-time Nikon DSLR shooter. However, over time I have moved away from demanding sports/actions shooting so I decided to give the NEX a shot. I'm really glad I did. This, in some ways, is a revolutionary camera line. The ability to shoot a wide range of reasonably good lenses on a device this size is truly liberating. I am sure that the 4/3 cameras and Fuii X-line are also very good. I don't have any experience with them. The bottom line with the NEX 6 is that I get the same image quality that we get with my wife's Nikon D7000....maybe better. (I'm told the sensors are the same. Maybe true.) I just got back from a week in Europe with the 6, the 10-18 OSS and the 18-200 LE. This turns out to be a great travel kit, allowing me to get a wide range of images in challenging conditions. (If I had to choose just one lens it would be the 18-200.) Here are some general comments on the 6.1) If you have never lugged around a D3 with fast glass for 12 hours, you may not appreciate the magic of the this camera from a weight perspective. Again, liberating.2) Ergonomics are excellent, starting with the solid build quality. I actually prefer the solid \"rubbery\" feel of the 6 more than the slippery metal of the more expensive 7. Buttons seemed to be in just the right place. I got used to the \"Sony way\" in just a couple of days.3) The EVF is a great option. I use it at least 50% of the time.......  I'm sure its a personal preference and I respect those that prefer an optical view finder. It's just that I really like the ability to see everything about my settings and menu options in the VF, without having to back my eye out to the screen. I am back-and-forth a lot with my dSLR's.4) Low light results are really good. I can use ISO 3200 shots out-of-camera.5) Ok, so focus is not dSLR-like. Expect a little bit of hunting in low-light. Even in good light, subjects do not \"snap\" into focus the way they do with a good dSLR. They kind of \"glide\"into focus. That's fine with me. I didn't buy this camera for action photography.6) Metering seems to work great. I left it on matrix during my recent vacation. I did not experiment with spot or area. I assume they are also excellent. White Balance on the NEX 6 is a bit tricky. Unlike my Nikon dSLR's, I cannot always depend on \"auto\". On a cloudy day, it is much better to set WB to \"cloudy\". Otherwise, you can get a blueish hue.  (I shoot JPEG, so I like to get the WB right in-camera.)7) Focus peaking is great. If you're like me, and have poor eyesight, you've probably tried to stay away from manual focusing. With focus peaking, you can get really good results without all the eye strain. I am also using some of my Nikon AF-D glass, and the focus peaking really makes it a blast!8) Battery life seems fine to me. (Is that scientific enough?!) I always carried an extra battery, but seldom had to use it, even after a full day of shooting.9) The digital \"clear zoom\" is outstanding. It gives you 2x when you need it, with excellent results. I know I could crop an image in post-processing. I just prefer to get it in-camera, and the NEX allows me to do that.10) Wi-fi in-camera does nothing for me now. BUT.....I do see the potential. Lots of possible uses, not the least of which would be downloading software updates directly to the camera.So, I hope this stream-of-consciousness review is helpful to someone. Good luck with your purchase!", "Date": "December 31, 2012"}, {"Title": "Image quality comparison Sony NEX6, Nikon D600, Fuji XE1", "Author": "Doctor.Generosity", "ReviewID": "R5QL02UO834DR", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I arranged to get these three top cameras at the same time and tested them on the same indoor shot (bookcase of colorful books) with room light at ISO 3200 and 800 and flash at ISO 200. Had to use different lenses of course (18-55mm zoom on Sony, 24-85mm zoom on Nikon, 18-55mm zoom on Fuji), and all shots were JPEGs, so this comparison does not make it possible to distinguish the relative contributions of sensors, lenses, jpeg processors. All the noise reduction settings were on defaults. Just for fun I threw in my Canon S95 pocket camera and my iPhone5. All pix were blown up to the screen equivalent of about 24\" wide.A word about JPEGs vs. RAW: It is important to understand that modern lenses including these three are no longer just hunks of glass; they are designed to be used with the in-camera JPEG processing firmware, which undoes the inherent distortions on the wide angle side. Vignetting is also corrected, and chromatic aberration. It is no longer necessary to design lenses depending so much on the difficult correction of glass elements with additional glass elements, aspherics, etc. Lenses are now part software, which results in better optics at lower cost. In principle a poor single element lens could give near perfect results, limited only by the processing power of the little computer in your camera. You can see this for yourself; watch the LCD image and then fire the shot - you'll see the replay image come up with the whole field visibly altered by software distortion correction. For this reason it would require a lot of skill and Photoshop time to do the same thing manually starting from the RAW images. JPEG's are the way these lenses are designed to be used, so that's how they should be evaluated, as part of the whole camera.Results at ISO 3200:- Nikon D600 (full frame) gave the nicest image, as we should certainly expect for the sensor size, camera size and weight, and cost. Image was creamy, clean and contrasty.- Fuji XE1 was second. Image was just a bit noisier and rougher than Nikon full frame.- Sony NEX6 was third. Although it had more contrast than the Fuji, this varied by colors; in some areas, such as red type on a blue book cover, the image actually washed out completely. Noisier than Fuji and evident compression artifacts.- Canon S95 quality is not in the same ballpark at high ISO and magnification; very rough.- iPhone5; like a juvenile delinquent in a class full of straight A students!Results at ISO 800:ISO 800 is my basic setting in daily photography. All three images were beautiful.- XE1 was the cleanest, but the Sony NEX had more punch and contrast.- Nikon D600 was a bit rougher and noisier than the other two, but of course had the highest pixel density when blown way up.Results at ISO 200:- Nikon D600, Fuji XE1 and Sony NEX 6 are quite comparable, with the choice being almost a matter of taste. Here the D600 is a bit noisier than XE1 in some areas and many people would say the Fuji XE1 half frame actually looks better overall than the Nikon full frame, which is remarkable. Sony NEX is right up there with them; the three images have different qualities, but there is no obvious winner. Canon S95, although still raggedy compared to this company, is not bad at all at low magnification and low ISO.What is amazing about comparing XE1 and D600 is not that the Nikon DSLR is superior but that it is only SLIGHTLY superior and then only under extremely low light and high magnification. Fuji really seems to have some special sauce on their half-frame sensor which allows it to capture photos almost as good as a full-frame DSLR. At ISO800, they are all very good but XE1 is best. If your goal is best image with least bulk to lug around, XE1 is the winner. The XE1 is an improvement over XPro-1, simpler, smaller, but still a bit quirky and the interface odd. Sony NEX was just a bit muddy at high ISO, but superb at ISO800 and below. Also, there are so many other good things about Sony NEX (focus peaking, in-camera HDR, articulated LCD, wireless, ability to use legacy lenses easily in MF mode, picture effects) that I use mine all the time.I still have a soft spot for my Nikon, and greatly prefer the optical through-the-lens viewfinder to EVF or LCD, but objectively speaking, purely in terms of image quality per unit weight/size, there is no longer any real justification for DSLR. Fuji is a unique instrument for the photographic artist. Sony NEX is also so good as to make the need for full frame DSLR questionable, and is the most flexible, ergonomic and cleverly fabricated of the three. You may have various reasons to choose one of these three, but image quality is no longer the deciding factor. Finally, all three of these are cameras for photographic fanatics; for ordinary folks looking to capture uncropped snapshots in good light at a viewed size about 4x5, the tiny Canon S95 and iPhone5 results don't look that much worse to the naked eye.", "Date": "December 1, 2012"}, {"Title": "Switched from DSLR for this NEX and I will never look back", "Author": "Jaafar Benabdallah \"Jaafar\"", "ReviewID": "R1VIFM7YLMGKQ6", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "To make it short, as there's detailed good reviews over here, I've been using a Nikon D90 for almost 4 years and loved this camera very much. When I decided it's time to update, compactness was my first priority but with minimal loss in the quality and the usability. Well, after almost 3 weeks with the NEX6, I can confirm that image quality is definitely there, especially in JPEG. With raw, as the kit lens has clearly visible vignetting and distortion especially at 16mm, you need either the Sony image data converter (excellent for automatic correction) or Lightroom with a profile. But IMO this is only needed for delicate situations (high contrast, use of very high ISO, lots of dynamic range). JPEG are really excellent for most occasions. (I know other people swear only by RAW, they probably should skip the 16-50). High ISO performance is good, 1600 is usable straight out of camera, and 6400 is not that bad after Lightroom correction.As for usability, it's not yet as good as an advanced/expert DSLR. I like how the rear dial can be used for multiple functions and replaces few buttons (ISO, exposure compensation and drive mode) but it requires a 3-step operation instead of 2 with physical buttons. AF speed and accuracy is good, almost as good as in a DSLR except for moving subjects and low light. But few seconds delay for focusing is not a big deal if you're not shooting action. The Fn button is a life savior to change a lot of settings (e.g. AF and metering modes) without diving in the awful menu. To sum it up, I would consider that what we lose in ease and speed of settings is largely compensated by the compactness of this camera when the 16-50 is mounted. It fits in large pockets, you can carry it on your shoulder a whole day and you won't feel it. If you need other lenses, you can put them in any pocket. I have the promising 35mm f/1.8 on order and I'm currently using the Nikon 50mm f/1.8G and the Nikkor 105mm f/2.5 via an adapter. Manual focusing is easy with focus peaking and magnification, although it requires several seconds to achieve. Ah yes, the EVF is really nice, and I'm already used to it. The image is as large as in a Full frame DSLR, and the possibility to preview the image that will be captured is a very convenient feature that compensates the lack of \"reality\" that is lost compared to an optical viewfinder. After all, what's the point of direct view through the optical viewfinder if the sensor will not capture it as we see it?Higly recommended for DSLR shooters that look for a compact and very capable camera.", "Date": "November 29, 2012"}, {"Title": "It's an amazing camera, but it depends on what your skill level is and what you are looking for.", "Author": "James Minh Tran", "ReviewID": "R1TDGEBZE9VSRZ", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "A point I want to get across first is if your reading this, you have to decide what kind of photographer you are right off the start.Are you someone just starting?Are you a casual shooter who just wants good pictures and either is considering this first an entry level dslr or has one already but is considering a size reduction?Are you a legacy lens shooter who knows about and is looking towards using vintage glass via adapters?Are you a professional/semi professional protog looking for a second/third back up or travel focus camera?The reason why I wanted to start with that is because this camera, can be your boon or our bane largely on what your exceptions coming in.--The Causal Shooter  Simply put for image quality, kit lens quality, auto focus speed,this camera will be on par with  t3i,t4i,t5i or the 3000 series from Nikon, epl/ep series from olympus easily plus or minus some pixel peeping tid bits. This particular APS-C sensor is fantastic at low light while providing plenty of resolution  for a crisp decently large size print, cropping, and obviously way more than needed for any sort of online social media sharing. Just let it be known that while smaller, it gives up almost nothing in terms of image quality, don't let size fool you! However, on the subject of size, it comes down to this. It's a smaller, much more compact camera than any DSLR out on the market, and thus way easier to carry around. However a reduction in size does obviously mean a reduction of ease of use. The Nex 6 has more than plenty of buttons and wheels for easy access for most controls, however a dslr simply always has more features and more dials, buttons etc to make it more quicker for setting changes on the go. Thus if your very casual shooter looking for very simple controls towards a nice photo, than the NEX series may be just for you. It gives you all the same ability and quality of a dslr just without the fluff.  I also forgot to throw in that with the NEX on board flash, you can tilt it upwards to create a bounce flash that is far better than limiting you to a direct flash alone like other cameras.--Current Entry Level DSLR Owners  This moves on to those who may already have a entry level DSLR and is considering a switch. This is a tougher situation but what you need to ask yourself is if your someone hoping to grow with photography, or simply looking to scale down. If your one of those people who bought a dslr hoping for those nice images you see other people have but eventually realized the bulk and the amount of buttons and knobs that you never bothered to learn just gets in the way then I'll say a sideways move to a NEX series camera is best for you. Your not giving up any image quality while reducing your size and again ridding of the fluff.  Now if your someone who does want to grow with photography, then you need to seriously consider Canon, M 4/3, Pentax and Nikon systems before you make this jump. I'm not going to lie, the brands simply has much much more to offer in the long run than the E mount at this point. Entry level lenses, mid level IS lenses, L lenses, TTL Flash, etc etc at a much better price point than any E Mount, or full frame E Mount gear currently. For example, Sony wants roughly $300 for a 50mm F1.8 while Canon offers a 50 1.8 for $100? 50mm F1.4 for $330?  You get the idea.--Legacy Shooters  I personally use my Nex 6 so that I can use the plentiful amount of old legacy lenses out there. If you don't know already, due to the short distance of the mount, your able to use adapters to mount any, and I do mean almost any, film camera lenses , and if you wish modern af lenses (although with no af controls outside of the contax G and A Mount I believe) to your Nex. I currently shoot Konica AR, Canon FD, and a few C Mount, Eos Mount, and Olympus mount lenses and all I have to say, it's the most joyful thing in the world. Obviously they are plenty of times where I wish I had autofocus due to the speed of the subject in which I'm taking my photo, however by shooting manual, I've grown to feel like I'm being more hands on with my photography than simply pressing a shutter button and calling it a day. No dig towards modern AF since well, obviously it's almost better in every way hence why we have it, but having old film lenses, and plenty of them is a joy to use. They render extremely nicely on the NEX 6 sensor (I previously owned a Nex 5n) with no resolution problems as seen on the Nex 7. The extra dial at the top makes it much easier to control shutter speed all the awhile the thicker body and grip of the 6 makes it much easier to balance the weight of the camera since most film lenses are quite heavy. My only grip is that the third wheel that is offered on the NEX 7 would've been nice for say exposure comp or quicker iso change but the downside is that NEX 7 Sensor pushes just a few too many MP and you lose the low light performance of the 6 , which for me personally, I find myself shooting far more often with not enough light than plenty.--Protogs looking for a 2/3 back up or travel cameraWhile I want to recommend this camera to you, I might have to say you should at the very least consider the competition. I think it's somewhat agreed that the NEX sensor is amazing, maybe second only to the AA less filter sensor of the fuji line, however the controls, the software, even the lens options, if your use to shooting cameras such as the 5d, 6d 70d etc your going to run into a situation where it baffles you on how limiting the NEX can be at times. Auto ISO almost always checks you in at 3200, histogram menu appears only to take away other information from the screen instead of allowing you to see it all at once or picking and choosing. Like I mentioned above, the price of lenses is insane, there's a massive premium compared to other brand lenses. Limited battery life, sd slot is housed in the same door as the battery slot, no weather sealing, I don't think I need to go on since if your one of these types you most likely already know the spec sheet by heart. The one thing I will say in the NEX favor however, is look at it's price point. For the images you get say NEX 6 + 35 1.8 (~$1046 going by amazon prices as of 2/1/2014 vs $1300 for a 23mm F2 Fuji X100s vs $1300 for body only EM1) the closest thing may be the $800 for XE-1 with Kit vs $748 for NEX with Kit in which case it's nearly a coin toss. In the pixel peeping wars, I believe the XE-1 wins out by a air with a bit better sharpness and obviously better rendering due to the lack of AA. However, it must be said that at what point are you going to need that extra pixel of sharpness? If your making life size prints, then by all means your going to need superior glass and rendering but if you already have a better camera for that then wouldn't anything not your primary camera not as good? This I believe will be hardly left to what sort of subjects your planning to shoot, and how each camera handles to you overall.-- Last wordsNow, I did notice I made no mention of the direct competition in that the M43 sensors cameras. Make no mistake, Olympus and some Panasonic cameras are amazing, especially the OMD Em1, the EP5 etc. I would love to have their 5 axis stabilization but for me personally, with their 2x crop factor, their higher price tag, and their (although such a touch) lower performance in low light high iso, I found the NEX series a better value for price point. M43 does have a much better system in that they have an amazing selection of extremely quality glass. Some bodies and lenses are weather sealed and honestly with enough light in the scene, they perform just as well as any non full frame sensors but overall it's just not for me.", "Date": "February 1, 2014"}, {"Title": "NEX-6 + Old Nikon Lenses = Great Combination", "Author": "S. Edelstein", "ReviewID": "R1L7KINSOK3QJZ", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "This is a rather specialized review that I'm writing for people who are interested in using great old Nikon lenses (ca 1960s to 1980s)  with their NEX-6. They make an excellent combination and the old Nikon lenses can be obtained for relatively cheap. What I have to say my be true for other lenses such as Canon but I have no experience with them.NEX-6 REVIEWIt's an excellent camera. I was attracted to it because of its low light capability and it's viewfinder. Both are excellent. I can usually shoot at ISO 3200 if I need to and get good results. The viewfinder is big and bright and I would not consider a high-end camera without a viable viewfinder, especially when using old lenses. I think the software is horrible. It is poorly organized and some functions are named so that you would never know what the function is unless you dig into the documentation. I would not recommend this camera for a novice. Overall I rate it at four stars.WHY OLD LENSES?Actually, I found out that I could use an old Nikon 50mm f/2 lens I had that's close to 50 years old. So I gave it a shot and it worked great. Everything is done manually and I find that improves my photography because I actually get to think about what I'm doing. With the NEX-6's 1.5 crop factor the 50mm is equivalent to 75mm for a 35mm format. This lens has become my favorite lens, again. Once I realized the 50mm worked so well I was hooked.I soon discovered that I could acquire some of the best lenses Nikon ever made at low cost. I probably went a little overboard but now I have a great collection of six Nikon prime lenses ranging from a 20mm f/2.8 to a 200mm f/f4. I even purchased  an 80-200mm zoom that's built like, and weighs like a tank. The total cost of five lenses I purchased was $500. I believe the equivalent optical power in new lenses would cost thousands.WHAT YOU GIVE UPYou give up autofocus, anti-shake, and many other automatic capabilities. But you don;t give up everything and not the ones that I think could the most for the quality of your photos. With a Nikon lens mounted you basically have a limited functioning camera and a lens. The rest is up to you, the photographer. You also sacrifice having the lightest weight and compact camera and lens. The Nikon lenses are known for their rugged metal construction and so they are heavier than today's lenses. If you only want to aim your camera and press the shutter I would not recommend this path. You can stop reading now.PICKING LENSESThe lenses I go for are the Nikon's made anywhere from the 60's through the 80's. They are either \"AI\" or non-AI (older are non-AI). You can read about AI on Ken Rockwell's site mentioned next. Basically, to AI or not makes no difference on the NEX-6 in and of itself. However, AI lens may have higher resale value but they generally cost more.There is an excellent web site by Ken Rockwell. Do a Google search and you will find it. Ken has reviewed just about every Nikon lens ever made, in fact it may be all for all I know. Although his reviews are based on all-Nikon shooting (camera + lens), I found the reviews to be very helpful, allowing me to select the lenses I wanted to hunt for (which turns out to be easy, more below. He has separate pages for the best and worst lenses and he explains his reasoning. Call me crazy, but I focused on the best lenses.Do not purchase \"G\" lenses. I have not used any but I think they have a different mount than all the others and I have been told they won't work.THE SECRET SAUCEIn order to use the lenses on an NEX-6 you need a lens adapter. I chose the Nikon Lens to Sony NEX E-Mount Camera Mount Adapter which is about $15 on Amazon. It gets the job done. But because I was committed to using the old lenses I decided to purchase an adapter for each lens which obviously adds some cost.  But I wanted the convenience of having the adapter+lens combination as a single unit to make it quick and easy to mount the lens.Attach a lens. Then turn on Peaking which allows you to make precise manual focusing adjustments by highlighting the edges that are in focus in your choice of three colors (white, red, or yellow). I wouldn't even consider old lenses on a modern camera unless there was something comparable to the Peaking technology.Go to SetupGo to Peaking Level and select a level. I like medium.Go to Peaking Color and select a color. I like red.In order to use your Nikon lens you have to go into the menu system again and change a menu setting, which has a name that sounds like nothing of what it does.Go to SetupGo to \"Release w/o Lens'Set it to \"Enable\"The camera will now work with non-Sony lenses like Nikons.When you switch the lens back to a Sony E-mount lens change the Release w/o Lens setting to \"Disable\".I also set \"Menu Start\" in Setup to Previous so that I can quickly get back to Release w/o Lens when that was the last setting I changed and I want to use my E-Mount lens.USING THE LENSESLike I said, everything is manual. I'm still experimenting with exposure combinations but there is a way to use the lens that works well for me under many lighting conditions. I set the ISO to auto. Auto ISO on the NEX-6 will not go over 3200 so that's fine for me. I set to S for shutter speed control and usually set the speed for the conditions while being careful to follow a rule of thumb of having a shutter speed set to a value that is at 1.5X the focal length of the lens to minimize motion blur in hand held shots.  For example, with the 50mm lens, 1.5x is 75. So I want the shutter speed faster, usually 1/100 of a second or faster.With those settings I am free to pay attention to f-stop knowing that the ISO will auto adjust as needed. This is evident in the viewfinder because you can see the final exposure and see if it looks right to you. Mostly it does unless it is very bright or very dark. Then more shutter speed and aperture adjustment is needed.With the shutter speed set I then make the manual aperture setting the focus of my attention. For great Bokeh with the 50mm lens I'll shoot wide open at f/2.ACQUIRING LENSESOnce I have decided which lens I want I'll shop on eBay. I haven't found a lens that isn't available there. By doing a search you will quickly get a sense for what a reasonable price range is. If you want to bid you may wind up getting a phenomenal lens at a great price.  Me, I'm the impatient type so I purchased all my lenses as \"but it now\".But there are some very specific things I look for in a lens and seller.1. The rating of the seller. I stick with 99+% buyer feedback. And there are many that fit that.2. Returns. I want a seller that has at least a 14 day return policy. If no returns I move on.3. Lens description--I read descriptions carefully to see if that's what I want. The good sellers will have good descriptions and lots of photos.4. Cost--I look for a price that's acceptable to me for the lens. The prices can vary widely to unreasonably low for a lens that has problems, to unreasonably high by sellers who I suppose want to prey on the naive buyer . But like I said, with a little bit of comparison shopping it becomes pretty easy to tell what fair price is. For example, the 50mm f/2 Nikkor AI or pre-AI, a terrific lens, can currently be had for about $50 (But It Now), or less in an auction.5. Shipping--I look for free shipping or up to about $10. There are overseas sellers and their shipping will stand out as being much higher, $20, $30, or more. I stick with US sellers.I did buy one lens off of Craig's list and that worked out great. The seller was nearby, a delightful person, and a professional photographer who gave me some photography tips.  THAT lens is a Nikkor 20mm (30 mm on the NEX-6) f/2.8. It is my most expensive lens at $200 but $100 or more dollars cheaper then if I purchased it on eBay.When I get the lens I test it. I make sure everything moves okay and that's generally smooth as silk like Nikon lenses usually are. Then I do some shooting test. They will include a shot or two at a clear part of the sky or cloudy sky, stopped down as far as the lens will go, f/22 for my lenses.  This type of shot will bring out lens imperfections such as scratches or other problems. The lenses I got all checked out great except for one lens that had very noticeable spots in the viewfinder with the lens stopped down. But I couldn't see anything on the lens so I blew on the sensor. That fixed the spots. It was dust on the sensor.The honest vendors will state the condition of the lens. I purchased a couple of lenses where the seller said there was a mild scratch in the coating. When I got the lens I thought the problems were overstated because I could not see anything. But I appreciated the honesty. The lens tests look fine to me so I kept the lenses.My lenses test always includes transferring the images to the computer and carefully examining the images for problems.  They have all passed with flying colors.I did return one lens because it had a built in lens shade and the paint was peeling somewhat. The peeling was visible in the sellers pictures but in person I know it would continue to bother me aesthetically although the lens tested fine. The seller took it back, no questions asked and made the process very easy.CONCLUSIONI have tried to bring out the main things that are important to me and what I've learned about using a state-of-the-art NEX-6 with old, high quality Nikon lenses. I don't claim to be a photo expert but I have been a life-long amateur photographer. I'm also sure there are people who would say why this route is a really dumb idea. Ken Rockwell for one is a big fan of auto everything. I might be too if I had really deep pockets. This way I can have the enjoyment of bringing great variety and optical quality to my photography at prices I can afford. And like I said, I think going manual with a quality prime lens makes me a better photographer.", "Date": "August 10, 2013"}, {"Title": "Great Combination of Price/Performance for a Mirrorless", "Author": "Justin", "ReviewID": "R9C8MJ8AVJK8B", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I figured I'd write a quick review just to set the record straight.  I've seen a lot of reviews that compare the NEX-6 to mid and higher-end DSLRs.  I've seen the NEX-6 compared to cameras like the Canon 5D Mark iii and claim the image quality of the NEX-6 is good, but doesn't compare to a 5D Mark iii.  That's just ignorance.  To take away stars from your review of the NEX-6 because it doesn't perform as well as a DSLR that costs 3 times as much doesn't make sense.  My guess is the writers of those reviews don't understand the point of a mirrorless system (in fact, some of them even call the NEX-6 a DSLR in their reviews).Mirrorless cameras excel in situations where carrying a full sized DSLR is prohibitive or awkward.  For me, photography is about having the camera with you when a scene presents itself, not lugging around a DSLR, setting it up on a tripod, leveling the tripod, framing the shot, etc.  With the NEX-6, photography is fun, not a chore.The NEX-6 achieves great image quality in a wide range of environments (the low light performance on the NEX-6 is exceptional for a mirrorless).  The camera doesn't look as intimidating as a DSLR which makes it easier for me to get nice candid shots (both family and street photography) because people don't immediately freeze and force a fake smile.I own the NEX-6 and almost exclusively use it with the Zeiss Sonnar T* E 24mm F1.8 (SEL24F18Z) or the Sony 50mm f/1.8 (SEL50F18).  The image quality with the Zeiss 24mm is absolutely stunning when you do your part.  The kit lens is really only workable if you shoot JPEG.  If you're just a point-and-shooter, you'll probably be happy with the quality of the kit lens.  I only shoot RAW, so my kit lens just gathers dust.If you're pixel peeping at 100% crop, yes, a full size DSLR will have better image quality, but you'll only notice the difference if your prints are 8 x 10 or larger.  At 1/3 the price and 1/2 the size of a Mark iii, I'll take the NEX-6 any day.  I know I'll have the NEX-6 with me when that shot presents itself.", "Date": "June 8, 2013"}, {"Title": "Amazing Pictures", "Author": "JB", "ReviewID": "R3BYRADK26POHD", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I debated a lot about whether to go with another point and shoot type device or upgrading. I love the point and shoot's ability to compact down when off and then basically fit into my back pocket. In the end, years of frustration with slightly out of focus pictures told me it was time to upgrade to something more. I thought I was going to buy the 5R, after all it was new, touch screen and amazing reviews were flooding in - but I was worried about no built in flash and the size of the lens included in the 5's kit. (The 5's lens was also getting very good reviews). I ended up checking out the 6 for these two specific reasons - the view finder I felt was a ho hum item for me. The flash was knowing it wasn't going to be the best, but something to be more of a fill flash for the slightly backlit shots was the key. In addition, the amazing compactness of the Power Lens on the 6 was a huge selling point.I have to say I'm not disappointed in the slightest. I don't just drop a grand on a whim, and was nervous, but I received the camera kit on Dec 20th and haven't looked back. I've started to realize that sometimes you can be good, composing shots, etc, and sometimes you can be lucky... Someone was talking about how they got 2000+ photos and still loved the camera... well I took close to 3500 photos over the Christmas holiday (PS a photo program for chewing through as many photos as this baby can take is critical of course). I'm on a fake it till you make it type of strategy with this - while not ever photo is perfect focus, its not the camera's fault but the owners - and I've got nearly 20 to 1 more in focus than our old point and shoot. The ability to instantly (and I mean INSTANTLY) take 10 photos is crazy. I've learned to focus very well for the first - rattle off 5 to 10 (as soon as I can lift my finger), bracket some, and focus bracket some (through the additional apps). We've gotten some gold through this camera and its worth getting them while our kids are young.I do have to say, there is a slight pause on the start up / shut down for the lens to do its thing. I've also noticed that this camera can't do two things at once when shutting off - say you rattle of 10 shots, it will pause you for a few seconds to write (maybe a full 3 seconds) during which time a little red light on the bottom by the battery / SD card slot will be lit. If these were your last shots, and you intended to power off and have the lens retract (to put the cap on and walk for example) it will WAIT for the writing to finish and then retract the lens - no way around it. I don't know why it can't write and retract at the same time - but it can't.The other small grip is actually the Movie record button (it is on the right hand side - about thumb level). In terms of starting the movie record, I have no problems with it, but man I keep forgetting where its at when I want to stop recording... trying to learn and become familiar with it more and remember this. That being said, I've been editing out the last few seconds of the videos I'm taking in order to have them stop where I intended.I will also mention that the weight, size (when on or off), and quality are all amazing. I've been so impressed with this thing. For a step up from a point and shoot, it really does not feel like its taken a bigger foot print at all. It easily fits in my coat pocket and is very light - when people say they don't notice the weight, I totally agree.Overall, as mentioned, as I've used this camera more, I've not regretted my purchase. The apps are great, the camera build quality is great, feels very comfortable in the hand, and the pictures are such an improvement I'll never go back.PS - we use the view finder more than we thought we would too - my wife more than I, but is very helpful in odd light spots.", "Date": "January 8, 2013"}, {"Title": "It left me wanting more (NEX-6 vs. Olympus OM-D)", "Author": "CHoff", "ReviewID": "R22LTE34G61251", "Overall": "3.0", "Content": "Me: A 31 year old photo enthusiast. I jumped on board the MFT train back in 2009. I owned a Lumix GF-1 (and briefly a GF-3) prior to this new camera. I started looking for a new camera because I grew tired of relying on flash photography when taking indoor photos of my daughter because all the no-flash pics were blurry despite maximizing aperture on the 14-42 kit lens. I know how to use all the PASM modes and understand the basics of exposure and composition. Basically, I read Understanding Exposure and spent a few years playing around with settings until I was comfortable. I'm by no means a photography fanatic or professional. I'm just a family guy who likes to get good pics of my family and nature.My criteria:MirrorlessCompactTakes quality indoor/low light photos without a flashEase of use (my wife just wants a camera that she can point and shoot)Fast focus to capture the kidsHas a flash when you need itAfter all my research, I narrowed it down to the NEX-6 and the OM-D. Despite all the hype with the OM-D, I went with the NEX-6 because of smaller size, larger sensor, pop up flash and wireless integration.NEX-6:I bought the Sony 16mm f2.8 to use for indoor photos. After getting the camera home and shooting several hundred shots, I was a bit disappointed.Autofocus: The autofocus was hunting frequently. It could usually lock on to a person in the center of the frame, but when I was trying to take a picture of our Christmas tree from 12 feet away, it would just hunt and hunt for a focus. It also couldn't keep up with my daughter resulting in many missed photos.User interface: Relatively easy to use. There is limited customization in buttons and settings. My biggest disappointment in this area is the inability to set auto-ISO limits. I often shot in aperture priority mode and the NEX would frequently crank up the ISO as high as 3200 before slowing the shutter speed resulting in grainy images. The NEX-6 review by pseudorandom parents summed up my frustration pretty well.Video: Great video, no complaints.Flash - Only used a few times, but generally resulted in very harsh photos. I did have great luck pulling the flash back with my finger to bounce it. I'm going to miss that capability. . .Touchscreen - The lack of touchscreen is a huge minus in my book. Once you get used to touching the object you want to focus on with a touchscreen camera, it's tough to go back.Wireless integration - A total publicity stunt. Very slow to connect, not useful. Apps are lame.Kit lens - It's compact. I only took a few shots with it. Performance wasn't great. About what you'd expect from a kit lens.Image stabilization - No in body IS and only a few lenses have it.Phase detect autofocus - This is one of the most heavily touted features of this camera. The problem is it only works with the kit lens right now. That being said, I really didn't notice a huge improvement even with the kit lens.OM-D:I bought the Panasonic Leica Summilux 25mm f1.4 to use with this camera. Keep in mind that all the criticisms of the NEX mentioned above were formulated after I got my hands on the OM-D. When I just had the NEX, I wasn't quite satisfied but I didn't really know why. After reading the amazon review of the NEX-6 by \"pseudorandom parents\" and then using the OM-D, I began to realize why the NEX-6 left wanting more.Autofocus: Just like all the reviews say, it's very fast. The autofocus tracking feature isn't all that reliable, but it actually works pretty good keeping track of my toddler. From what I've read, you need an SLR for good tracking performance.User interface - It's a little more technical than the Sony and you have to download the full manual for explanation of all the options. Even with the full manual, you'll be left confused more than a few times. The dpreview hands on is quite helpful. I'm still making my way through the pages to find all the features available. Suffice it to say that this thing is endlessly customizable.ISO - I know this seems weird, but the ISO performance seems to be better on the OM-D despite the smaller sensor. ISO limits are easily set as well.Video - I did video with the kit lens as well as the 25mm lens and I think that that the video on the Sony was a little better. My first video had a few wobbly frames which according to my research was due to a rolling shutter effect? Anyway, once I put the camera in movie mode (instead of just pushing the record button while in Ap), the effect seemed to go away.Flash - It is a hotshoe mounted flash which is compact but definitely adds bulk to the camera. Like I said above, I'll miss the pop up flash in the NEX and the ability to bounce the pop up flash. With the results I've had thus far, I don't think I'll be needing it very often.Touchscreen - A huge convenience. I love being able to touch to focus and snap a pic in a split second.Kit lens - This kit lens seems to be nicer than most kit lenses. I did a few videos with it and the electronic zoom is quite and smooth.Image stabilization - Since it's in the body, you don't have to worry about the lens IS. It's a really good 5-axis in body stabilizer, just read the reviews online.Digital zoom - you can program the function button to do a quick 2x digital zoom. I love this feature! It allows a convenient zoom feature when using prime lenses. It is a digital zoom so you will lose resolution, but I haven't noticed a huge change.APS-C vs MFT sensor - This was a huge concern of mine and a major reason for initially going with the Sony. I have to say that I haven't noticed any difference in low light, ISO noise, etc. In fact, the OMD seems to be better.Like I mentioned above, my wife just wants a camera that works. One she can pick up and snap good pics without much technical knowledge or tinkering with the settings. I think both cameras work well in this regard. I'm confident that either one will suffice although based on available settings and customization, I do think the OM-D is catered more towards enthusiasts and the NEX-6 more towards the average consumer. I know she will complain about the OM-D flash and the minor inconvenience of attaching it when you need a flash, but it's well worth the inconvenience in my opinion.One more thing. . .the EVF does seem better on the Sony. I've never owned an SLR or DSLR and don't care about the EVF so this feature doesn't really matter to me.\ufeff", "Date": "January 1, 2013"}, {"Title": "NEX-6: A Videographer's Perspective", "Author": "Jay Windland", "ReviewID": "RP9ZI6ARSSRD7", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "This review is going to focus on the NEX-6 as a video camera. To start with, I didn't even buy this camera to shoot video. I own an FS700 and shoot video professionally using the Metabones Speed Booster with full frame Canon lenses. I wanted an inxepensive stills camera that I could use with the Speed Booster just for fun and settled on the NEX 6. On a whim, I took it with me on a video shoot and was genuinely surprised at how well it handled as a B-cam. I do a lot of multicamera shooting and use a pair of Panasonic GH2's for alternate angles. The GH2 produces a very detailed image and has no recording time limits, so it is great for multicam events. The NEX-6 of course isn't going to replace the FS700, but it could well replace the GH2's as b-cameras, which came as a surprise to me. Here is the breakdown on topics important to me.Continuous Recording:While the GH2 can record continuously to the full capacity of the SD without interruptions, the NEX cameras are limited to 30 minute clips. Previous NEX models however would overheat and shut off before you got anywhere near that. The NEX-6 appears to have fixed this. There are reports online of people shooting five or six 30 minute clips back to back without overheating. As I write this, I am nearing the end of my second 30 minute clip and while there is a flashing yellow temperature indicator, the camera is not noticeably hot and recording has not stopped. As I write this sentence, I have just started my third clip. I could probably keep going, but I've already exceeded the real-world duration of a typical wedding ceremony or corporate presentation with no overheating issue. Of course the camera will need to be restarted (and re-synced in editing) every 30 minutes, so for really long events, the GH2 still wins in this arena.There are however a couple of differences in the camera's functions while recording. Unlike the GH2 and most other video DSLRs I've used, you can adjust the ISO while recording on the NEX-6. This is important for event shooters, because you could be rolling on an important event and have an unexpected lighting change. Your aperture may already be wide open or stopped too far down, and your shutter speed isn't a good way to ride your exposure because it will change with way motion is rendered. So your only recourse with many cameras is to stop recording (breaking sync with audio and/or other cameras) adjust your ISO and start recording again. This also slows down your shooting. With the NEX-6 you can change ISO without stopping. White Balance cannot be changed while rolling, but this is far less important in my opinion.One downside is that once you start rolling video, the histogram disappears. I cannot imagine why this would be, because it displays live on the LCD and EVF the rest of the time.Image Quality:The NEX-6 isn't tack sharp in video. The GH2 definitely resolves more fine detail and is able to reproduce intricate patterns without aliasing or moir\u00e9 artifacts. Aliasing and moir\u00e9 are present on the NEX-6, but in real world shooting don't crop up nearly as much as you see on Canon DSLRs. The NEX-6 image, while not overall as sharp as the GH2, has greater dynamic range and thus retains more detail in shadows and highlights and is a bit more flexible in real world uncontrolled lighting situations. The GH2 tends to crush the shadows and have punchy less natural colors. To my eye, the NEX-6 produces more pleasing colors and gentler gradations. A big part of this is down to picture profiles. The NEX cameras have a fairly flexible image with custom profiles and image settings. Comparatively, the GH2's picture profiles do relatively little to dial in a look. Even the more expensive VG series camcorders don't provide the level of image flexibility as the NEX cameras, despite sharing their sensors and other internal components. You can dial in the contrast, saturation and sharpness to fit any particular scene, as well as set color temperature in 100 kelvin increments and shift color on green/magenta and blue/amber axis's to help handle color casts in camera.Slow-Motion:The NEX-6 can shoot at 60 frames per second which makes very nice 40% slow motion when conformed to 24 frames per second in post. However you have to do it in post. It's not a difficult task, but you don't get to play it back at the intended speed in camera while you are on set. The FS700 and Panasonic GH3 before conform higher frame rates in camera, which means when you want to show a client how something is going to look, they can see how the slow motion affects the shot right there. It would have been great to see true in-camera slow motion in the NEX-6.Use as a main camera:Compared to a pro video camera, there is a lot missing here, but it really just boils down to audio and ND filters. The ND filters can simply be placed on your lenses, but the audio has to go somewhere else entirely. There is no mic input, no gain control, no meters, no headphones. As a b-camera this is no concern. Audio is going somewhere else anyway and the on-board mic is fine to help you sync in post. As a main camera, you just have to deal with external sound. (Note: I've read there is a hot shoe XLR audio component for the Sony A99 that is compatible with the NEX cameras, but it costs more than the NEX-6 itself. Not something I would run out and buy.)However, when you compare this to something like a Canon DSLR, I think it works out better as a main camera. For one thing, you have a built in EVF, so when shooting in bright sunlight you don't have to mess with loupes or external EVFs. The LCD is somewhat articulating, so you can go for high and low shots with much more ease than with a 5D. Also, add a Speed Booster and you have the same full frame field of view of view as that 5D with image stabilization and focus peaking in a tiny package at a fraction of the cost of a full frame Canon DSLR.Conclusion:Especially when paired with a Speed Booster, the NEX-6 is a sweet spot for video and stills. I wouldn't necessarily want it as my only camera, but it is a great b-cam to something higher end. And if you are just getting started, it's a great place to start.", "Date": "September 1, 2013"}, {"Title": "Great Camera! 5-Star with firmware update.", "Author": "T. Hosford", "ReviewID": "R1ZKSOSHQEORA", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "I have had this camera in hand for about 5 days now.  I can't say I know everything about it, so I will update this review as I learn more.Pros:SIZE AND WEIGHT: This camera is a pleasure to carry around.  This was the main reason I purchased a mirror-less camera system.  It can't fit in your pants pocket, but it can fit in a jacket pocket with the 16-50mm power zoom lens.  In fact, by getting it I am making a move from Nikon DSLR to the NEX system. (If you're looking for a D300, check out ebay. I'll be selling mine and the rest of my kit).  I love the D300 as a camera, but I don't like it as a heavy piece of bulk slung around my neck.  For this reason, I kept finding myself leaving it in the hotel room, or at home.  Then, most of our vacation pics or walking around pics end up being shot on our iPhones (not a very good camera), or my wife's Cannon S100 (amazing camera).PICTURE QUALITY: The picture quality is simply outstanding.  The sensor is top notch.  It's big, it is great at absorbing light, and the shots look beautiful.  This was one of the main factors in choosing Sony over Micro 4/3 or Nikon.  I wanted the depth of field provided by the larger sensor, as well as the better low light performance (in theory, at least).BUILD QUALITY: The camera is made of plastic.  But it is the good kind.  When you hold it, it just feels like a quality instrument.  Also, the battery and input/output doors feel secure and tough. The dials have a nice click to them.  The lowest \"soft button\" feels a bit mushy, but the rest give a nice click.  The flash button is a mechanical release, and works perfectly.  Just be warned that this is a \"protected\" button that has a raised ridge surrounding it, so, if you have big fingers, it will be hard for you to depress it far enough.MOVIE MODES: I was a bit worried that everything would go into auto mode when shooting video.  The NEX-7 literature from Sony repeatedly mentions \"full manual control\" and there was no such claim made of the NEX-6 (at launch time, anyway).  However, I have confirmed that when you put the camera in manual mode and press the movie button, it says in manual mode.  You can change the aperture, ISO, and shutter speed (within reason: there are limitations due to frame rate - 30 frames per second means each frame must be faster than 1/30 of a second).VIEWFINDER: The viewfinder is great.  It is pretty much a requirement in direct sunlight.  I was going back and forth between the Micro 4/3 and the Nex-5, because the NEX-7 was a bit much.  When the NEX-6 was announced, it was \"lights out\" for the rest and I pre-ordered.  Unlike a DSLR you don't see what the camera is seeing, you see how the camera is seeing it.  So, if you have the shot underexposed or over exposed, you are seeing it as such.  You are basically seeing what you would on a point and shoot, but through the viewfinder.  This is kind of cool, as you can see full menus there and manipulate them.  A neat little trick that they do is it senses when you put the camera to your eye, and it automatically turns off the screen on the back of the camera, and turns the viewfinder on.  I have found this sensor to be too sensitive. If you are trying to shoot from around your belly, with the tilt screen turned up. It will often switch to the viewfinder so you cant see what you are trying to get a picture of anymore.WIRELESS: I haven't been able to get the camera to connect to my router.  For some reason, it can't even see my router.  I'm not sure what the problem is because my MacBook Air, iPhone, PS3 all have no problem seeing it.  It must be something wrong with the firmware, because the camera's wireless does work.  I downloaded the camera control app and put it on the camera, and you can connect it to the iPhone and see what the camera is seeing.  This is very useful for taking pictures of groups.  You can frame the shot while in the group and then tell the camera to snap the shot from your iPhone.  It gives you a few second to put your iPhone in a pocket so all of your pictures aren't of you holding your iPhone.  Anyway, we found this to be very slick.MODE DIAL: This thing is so darn useful.  Mostly I have been just playing with the Camera over the past several days, but I find myself going to this dial all the time.  It is so easy to quickly change modes.  I don't know how I lived without it for so long on the D300.  It would have been nice if they added a U1 and U2 like the D7000, but I'm not complaining.CONTROLS: The layout of the controls is perfect.  I love the wheel under the mode selector, and the back wheel.  It could do with some more customization on what you use each for.  Especially in manual mode.Cons: It feels like Sony shipped this camera using the video game model:  Get it mostly complete, and issue an update patch later.  Although, I'm still waiting for the update patch.AREAS THAT NEED FIXING WITH FIRMWARE:1. There seems to be a \"wake up\" bug that has happened to me twice in 5 days where the camera won't re-extend the 16-50 lens when the camera wakes up.  So, it is trying to operate and focus with the lens collapsed.  At first I thought the autofocus was going crazy, but then I realized the lens was still collapsed. You need to turn the camera off and turn it back on and it seems to reset itself.  Not critical, but it could cause you to miss a shot.2. APPEARS TO BE FIXED NOW: Finding a wireless access point appears to have some flaw preventing it from seeing access points.  I'm not sure what is wrong, but it won't see my router (and all my other wifi gadgets do)3. Enable auto ISO in M mode.4. Ability to adjust the sensitivity of the viewfinder eye sensing.5. Ability to adjust audio input levels.OTHER ITEMS THAT WOULD IMPROVE THE CAMERA:1. Bundle a real battery charger instead of the battery-in-the-camera charging device.  With the poor battery life, it is pretty clear that we will all be purchasing a second battery.  So, it is much more useful to be able to charge the second battery while using the camera with the first battery.  Right now, you need to use the camera to charge the battery.  That is just lame.2. UPDATE: ADDED BY SONY: Add a Time Laps video function. Both with photos and video. (This may be an app in the future)3. Ability to customize what is on the view finder and what is on the back screen independently.  (i.e. use the viewfinder for framing the shot, and use the back screen for menus and picture review... but never have that stuff in the viewfinder.4. UPDATE: SONY ANNOUNCED THEY HAVE ADDRESSED THIS: Third party camera apps?  Not sure if anyone would do it, but it would make the app store much more useful.5. Add a Custom user settings U1 & U2 to the Scene mode.  Allow these to be shared on playmemories store.CONCLUSION:All in all, this camera is great.  I am liking it the more I use it.  The lens selection is small compared to either of the Big 2 DSLR formats, but this whole line of cameras is new and more lenses are on the horizon.  There also appears to be 3rd party support gaining ground.  This camera is easily a 5 out of 5 if Sony just cleans up a few things that are all firmware related.UPDATE: Sony just released a Time-Laps application for the camera. It costs $10 on the sony app store.  It has really increased the coolness of the camera for me.  The app is great, and will automatically make the shots into a movie for you, or will just store them all as still images for you to later put together.  It is well designed and very convenient to use. Although, they need to add an option to turn off the LCD while taking the time laps.  The whole point of this is to set it and forget it (Like a crockpot), and then come back in 2 hours and see what you got.  However, it's 99% of the way there.  Great update, Sony.  It's at about 4.5 stars now.  I look forward to more updates... this camera is so close to being a solid 5 stars.I also bought a Sony E-mount to Nikon adapter so I can use some of my old prime lenses.  With the focus peaking function on the camera, it is super easy to get sharp focus quickly using the manual focus ring.  Also, the camera is smart enough to automatically adjust exposure to a normal level, so it's not \"full manual\" or nothing, but you can also use the full manual mode if you want.UPDATE 2:Sony has issued another Firmware update to bring it to 1.02.  This update expands the usefulness of the smartphone remote function.  It makes the camera a lot more useful in that mode allowing adjustment of nearly everything right from the phone.The more I shoot with this camera, the more I love it.  It is truly a great camera. One issue that has come to my attention is with video, or rather recording audio in video mode.  Currently, there is no way to adjust the audio input levels (or even observe the audio levels on the screen).  This \"auto only\" mode can result in audio issues.  Obviously in camera audio is always bad, but this lack of manual control even extends to the sony hot-shoe microphone.  The camera's auto mode pumps the gain too high, so you can never actually record silence.  So, when the room is silent, you will get a hiss instead of silence.", "Date": "November 18, 2012"}, {"Title": "Awesome enthusiast camera -- surpasses expectations of long time photo enthusiast", "Author": "V. Price \"Vincent\"", "ReviewID": "R1AUY3SRUF3KFZ", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I'm a long-time serious amateur who used to shoot with everything from 35mm to medium format to 4x5 and 8x10 sheet film (and spend days on end in the darkroom processing and printing).I purchased this camera to replace a Canon T1i digital SLR.  The Sony NEX-6 has 60% higher resolution with tons of features as my Canon at only a fraction of the size and weight -- especially with the newer E-Mount lenses attached.  The camera with its 16-50mm kit lens can actually fit inside my coat pocket when turned off.  (The lens sticks out a bit longer when the camera is turned on; it collapses to a very compact size when the camera is off.)I can set the ISO to 3200 and take low-light photos with almost undetectable noise compared to what I could do with the Canon T1i DSLR.  The burst mode is MUCH FASTER than my Canon DSLR's.My favorite feature of the NEX-6 so far has been the \"Focus Peaking\" combined with the very intuitive and very intelligent way it automatically sets everything up. It has allowed me to purchase and use some very fast, old \"Olympus Zuiko OM\" manual focus prime lenses from eBay.  The NEX-6 with its focus peaking allows me to manually focus very quickly and accurately with those lenses (even in relatively low light), and the \"Aperture Priority\" mode on the camera automatically sets all the other settings on the camera so the exposure comes out perfectly.When I use my NEX-6 with one of the E-Mount lenses that was designed by Sony for its NEX cameras, I can just set the camera to one of the two \"I\" (Intelligent) modes and just compose my shot and pretty much not have to worry about anything else.  The only shots I've gotten that were \"bad\" so far from this camera have been badly composed shots or shots where the camera had focused on the wrong subject in the photo.  Exposures themselves have been \"spot on.\"  For portraits, the camera is able to detect faces and even track them around the scene if the subject moves around. When set on \"I+\", the camera will actually take multiple exposures and perform automatic HDR compensation to capture the best exposure possible.  It does it so much more quickly than I could do with manual fiddling on my older Canon T1i and photoshop post-processing.One of my two complaints about this camera is that Sony's app store for its NEX camera line has a very limited selection of apps -- and what is available is rather expensive if one is used to the typical prices for apps on Google's playstore or Apple's iTune app store.  Apps for this camera on Sony's store runs from \"Free\" for the several basic apps available to $4.99 and $9.99 for the more useful apps.  This is a mintor complaint -- the built-in features that come with the camera already blow away what I could ever dream of with my 3-year-old Canon T1i, and the NEX-6 still has more features than most of the current cameras in this price class from other manufacturers.My second complaint is that unlike the other major lines of cameras (e.g., the 3/4th format from Panasonic and Olympus or the DSLR cameras from any of the other manufacturers or from Sony itself), the line of native E-mount lenses available from Sony and third-party companies is very, very limited.  On the other hand, as I've mentioned, this camera works so well with the old manual focus lenses that I'm enjoying using my old film camera lenses with it.Overall, this camera is AWESOME.  After reading all the glowing reviews and seeing the specs, I had very high hopes for this camera.  This is one of the few items I've purchased that has surpassed my expectations.  It allows me to take great pictures with minimal effort -- I just worry about the composition, and the camera takes care of almost everything else to capture the best exposure possible.  Its ability to use cheap, super fast, high-quality manual focus lenses from Olympus and others has been an added, fun bonus that connects me with the old film days while allowing me access to fast optics that would easily have cost me thousands of dollars in their modern digital-era incarnation.UPDATE, Oct 2013:  After a month and a half with this camera, I'm even happier with it now than when I first got the camera.  I just spent the day with the NEX-6 and a 40-year-old manual focus, Olympus 100mm f2.8 lens.  It was just a great pleasure walking around with such a small system that captures such wonderful portraits/people photos.  The old olympus zuiko prime lenses go so perfectly with this camera:  The lenses are very compact, light, sharp, and fast (large apertures).", "Date": "September 29, 2013"}, {"Title": "The Best NEX IMO", "Author": "Gregory S.

Here is what it doesn't get right:(1) So dang many features and menu options, not entirely self-explanatory, that I haven't really settled into a clear shooting pattern with it yet. I read the entire, not-very-good, manual that was supplied. Then I bought the Matsumoto-Roullard book, and it is starting to solve this issue.(2) The NEX-6 chews through its batteries pretty fast. To help with this problem, I got two spare batteries and a wall charger.(3)There aren't enough accessories in the box. You need:  - Sony's case***  - a UV filter (I got the Hoya HD2 UV 40.5mm)  - a cap-keeper (http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B005FH3SGQ)  - an LCD screen protector (http://www.amazon.com/Sony-Semi-Hard-Plastic-Protective-Screen/dp/B005K8AUE8)  - lens/LCD screen cleaning wipes (wet/dry combo)  - the aforementioned spare batteries (at least one) and wall charger  - a couple of 32 GB SD cards (or at least one) -- I got the Sandisk Extreme Pro rated for 95Mb/sBy the time you get all those things and pay tax, you will have spent over $1000 even if you started at under $700 for the kit. None of these accessories should really be considered optional.Looking forward to seeing a Sony A6000. The viewfinder isn't as big and bright according to some preview reviews, so they may have downgraded my favorite feature. Faster A/F never hurts. Maybe I'll have A6000 envy. Maybe not.Notes:* The NEX-6 has logic that corrects for the aberrations in the kit 16-50 zoom lens. I'm very happy with the image quality, but if you shoot RAW, you'd have to load the same lens correction parameters into your desktop image editing software. The barrel distortion and vignetting is pretty bad without correction.** My idea of satisfaction back in the days of film was a Nikon FE2 with various Nikkor AI lenses. This is the first camera I have been pleased to own since I quit lugging that around about 20 years ago.*** People are grousing too much about the case. They literally haven't figured out how to use it. Hold the camera in its case in your right hand. Unsnap the left snap on the bottom of the case. That is the smaller snap. If you unsnap the right (larger) snap, you will have the same complaints about how awkward the case hangs. The issue about having to remove the case to get at the USB and charging ports is correct but not that big of a deal. The fit on mine is fine. I am suspicious people aren't letting the kit lens fully retract before trying to wrap the case on, because that would explain the lack of space some are complaining about.", "Date": "March 21, 2014"}, {"Title": "superb image quality from your pocket", "Author": "Teddy W.

We own the Canon 40D, 5DMarkIII, and several canon compacts.- We have, over time, chosen select Sony compact cameras for their size/speed/etc.  This is our 3rd Sony camera.I purchased the NEX-6 in November as an early Christmas present.  Also purchased the 50mm f1.8 and the Sigma 30mm f2.8 lenses for the e-Mount series.  I selected the NEX-6 over the NEX-7 due to the increased cost of the NEX-7 coupled with complaints from customers with views that seem to indicate that the NEX-7 wasn't really ready for release.After approximately 500 photos and a dozen movie segments, I can report that this camera leads our Canon DLSR's in several areas.  I am completely impressed.Pros;- Size (it is amazingly compact for the performance.  With the pancake lens, it's a coat-pocket camera.)- Speed (This camera is extremely fast.  And quality of resulting images does not suffer in exchange for speed.)- Convenience (on auto, the camera adapts extremely well to multiple environments, both indoor and outdoor)- Color representation (The camera nailed almost every situation in terms of color balance)- Clarity (no matter the lens, the camera produced sharp and clear pictures in almost all cases, even in difficult situations)- HD Movie performance (very satisfied with the results)Cons;- Limited lens selection (need a better selection of telphoto and zoom)- Battery must be charged in the camera by USB chord- Kit pancake lens at wide angle needs improvement- Cost (while I still consider the camera a good value to me, I believe this technology/cost ratio should be more in line with entry-level DSLR cameras)Lens;- Pancake kit lens is funky at the wide end, but otherwise fast for its specs and overall a good lens.- Sony 50mm f1.8 is my favorite so far.  Brilliant, sharp, and very fast for portrait shots.- Sigma 30mm f2.8 is decent.  Considerably slower when compared to Sony lenses in the same f-stop ranges.I am waiting for the Sony 35mm prime e-mount to be in stock.  I'm betting on it to become the best in walk-around lensware on this camera.At the end of the day, I would absolutely buy this camera again, although I would look for a price drop in the near future.The 4-star rating balances the excellent performance of this camera with the lack of lens selection and the price.", "Date": "January 2, 2013"}, {"Title": "This is a very nice DSLR for someone who wants portability", "Author": "Alex", "ReviewID": "R3OR6XEUEV874Q", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I saw this camera at BestBuy and didn't like it at first because it looked like a point and shoot compact camera. well I bought Canon cameras for my whole life.

The 6 feels like a pro-grade camera, and the 5N feels like a toy now. Nice, sturdy, heavy feel (may be a downside to some who need it as light as possible), and great grip for shooting photos and videos.I use a 5DMK2 for professional use, and originally bought the Nex-5N for travelling. I had a T2i initially for travel, but it was still too bulky. I fell in love with the nex 5N's small body, and great quality lenses. Naturally, being used to full body canons, i got a little frustrated with the 5N's touchscreen controls, and missed a wheel for quick adjustments. I would sometimes lose the shot searching through menu's, and the control wheel of the 5N was a lot more flimsy, causing you to screw up every so working on the controls when rushing adjustments. The 6 is has tougher controls and quicker to set... much more satisfying for the one that knows how to use it.Also regarding the more sturdy pro-like body, it feels like I can even take it on one of my photo shoots. Maybe I will and see if a client cares.Anyways, that's my input. Some side things:-I'm a fan of micro-usb charging. One less thing to carry when travelling light. Yes a small plastic piece is a big deal, especially when backpacking across the amazon. I don't have to dig around my pack just to charge batteries, nor do I have to worry about losing a charger (which would screw me on a trip). I can charge it through a external battery, which I already own, on the fly without an outlet (on a bus or plane). Also, all my other electronics charge off micro usb, so no extra cable to bring (only exception is my GoPro, but mini-usb is close enough). If it's a big deal, Wasabi (that's the brand) sells spare batteries that work as good as the original, and it comes with an external charger. Even better, I bought that wasabi kit for my 5N and they are they work perfectly for the 6. Wasabi Power Battery (2-Pack) and Charger for Sony NP-FW50 and Sony Alpha 7, a7, Alpha 7R, a7R, Alpha a3000, Alpha a5000, Alpha a6000, NEX-3, NEX-3N, NEX-5, NEX-5N, NEX-5R, NEX-5T, NEX-6, NEX-7, NEX-C3, NEX-F3, SLT-A33, SLT-A35, SLT-A37, SLT-A55V, Cyber...-It's bigger than the 5N, but not so much. Considering I also had the external flash always installed on my 5N, the \"area\" it takes up isn't that much bigger. Plus, the pancake lense makes up for it, and feels much sturdier than the original 18-55mm.-Built in flash can be pointed straight up. Those who know the advantages of that, will understand why thats a pro. You can't set it to that position, but you can hold it pointed up by keeping your finger on the spring.-wifi functions is an advantage i wasn't shopping for originally, but glad i have it now. works perfectly on my galaxy s5, and can instantly upload photos without a laptop, on the fly.", "Date": "May 6, 2014"}, {"Title": "aweeeesooommmeeeeee buy it!", "Author": "Kristin", "ReviewID": "R155BN8SHW73IJ", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "This camera is so freaking cool.

Well I have grown tired of crappy cell phone pics but I was so used to all the cool filters and effects my phone can do so I went on the hunt for something under $400 but this camera kept getting recommended and I somehow talked my husband into it...he was practically talking ME into it after I showed him the stuff it could potentially do.. but its not cheap!!I was a little overwhelmed but I took the time to look through the manual while intermingling hands on as I was reading to start learning about this camera.

The XZ-1 is very nice, but you get so much better pictures by having a viewfinder to be able to see and frame your shots on sunny days and there are more things you can do with this.For example, I love the free SmartRemoteControl app. You can see a live view from the NEX 6 on your smartphone or tablet, zoom, change shutter speed and iso and take the picture using wifi. Its good for about 75 feet. I used it as a \"pole camera\" this weekend at an airshow. If you google \"pole photography\" you will see the pole pixie. Click on the gallery there and see how it takes better house pictures for real estate agents by putting the camera up high. Its also good for events. I used this to look over the crowds at the airshow and into the parked vintage fighter plane cockpits. It also would be great for getting a better angle on volleyball games, Civil War re-enactments and any number of outdoor events... wherever you might want to get a better angle or see over everyone's head. The great thing about using the NEX 6 with the SmartRemoteControl app as a pole camera is that you can SEE and frame your shot on your phone or tablet to get the picture you want instead of just taking a bunch of random pictures off a pole until you might get something. I got a painter pole to 1/4-20 adaptor on ebay for about $15 to do this, and it is very cool.I also picked up an E mount to M42 Pentax screw mount adaptor for another $15 along with some legendary Super Takumar lenses on ebay. These are all BEAUTIFULLY made, black solid metal, manual focus. Go to pentaxforumsdotcom/lensreviews for some recommendations and sample pictures to see what you can do.  I picked up a 50 mm f1.4, a 135mm f3.5 and a 200mm f4 for $75, $36, and $50 respectively These were all around 40 years old, but all MINT condition and much nicer looking than anything new and plastic. The f1.4 is great for portraits with the blurred backgrounds, indoors low light etc. You put the camera in  shutter priority or manual, but then you can set AUTO ISO which makes it pretty hard to go wrong! You can also use histogram in the viewfinder for a second opinion if you wish, but I don't find it necessary. Likewise, focus peaking can be used as a focusing aid in place of the old split screen. But again, the viewfinder is so good that I don't feel the need to have either histogram or focus peaking turned on, but they are there and they work.The great viewfinder, the pole photography and the legendary Pentax Super Takumar lenses have made this a great camera to play with and I've been getting better pictures than I ever have before.  BTW for point and shoot, it's good for that too, especially with the nice wide kit lens. If you use the Sony lens the camera also digitally corrects for any aberrations like pincushion etc. to mimic the $1000 plus German made lenses. Well obviously the German manufacturers and their admirers are going to dispute that, but I think it gets you at least a little closer to that level of perfection on a \"budget.\" But try those old super Takumar primes for color, clarity and sharpness. If they don't make you happy, you can \"rebay\" them and get your money back. I'm keeping mine.Hope someone out there reads this and has a similarly great experience. This is by far the best camera I've ever had the pleasure of using.", "Date": "January 12, 2014"}, {"Title": "Good balance of size, image quality, and features -- one of the better mirrorless camera choices", "Author": "RandomReader123", "ReviewID": "R1U5EM00CVZ02S", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "The Sony NEX-6 is a very good mirrorless camera that we chose after trying out a fair number of competing cameras.  It's not perfect -- no camera is -- but for our needs and preferred style of use we felt it was the best compromise out of the current crop of cameras.  I'd held off on writing this review until I felt I understood the camera well enough to be able to provide useful information on its strengths and weaknesses.  We've now had it for about two months at the time I write this.Summary:Our priorities were good still and video quality, light weight/portability, and having a viewfinder (as opposed to needing to rely on the rear screen to frame shots).  We bought this camera for a family with both enthusiast (like to take full manual control) and casual (just want to use the camera as a point-and-shoot) photographers.  Overall we're quite pleased with the camera and have gotten some very good shots with it.Pros:- The sensor (essentially the same sensor as a good APS-C DSLR) provides very good image files with relatively low noise.- Plenty of resolution for most people (unless you're printing quite large or doing a lot of cropping, you're unlikely to need more).- Better-than-average video quality for cameras in this segment, including the ability to take full manual control of shutter/aperture/ISO while taking video.- One of the smallest/lightest bodies among cameras that include a viewfinder.- One of the better electronic viewfinders available today.- A reasonable-sized grip that makes it easy to hold on to despite its small size.- The included zoom lens is very compact for the amount of coverage it provides.- Fast, accurate auto-focusing so long as the subject isn't moving too quickly.- If you're willing to deal with RAW files (as opposed to the more convenient JPEGs) the image files have a lot of latitude for recovering blown highlights and shadow detail.- A clearly marked mode dial that makes it easy to put the camera in point-and-shoot mode (when you don't want to have to fuss with settings and are willing to let the camera make all of the decisions) or Program, Aperture Priority, Shutter Priority, of full Manual control.- Ability to use \"legacy\" lenses from other camera systems via cheap adapters (for more advanced users only, as in most cases you have to manually focus and select the lens aperture).  The focus peaking feature really makes this work well.- A built-in flash plus a hot-shoe that allows the use of a dedicated flash unit (or other accessories).Cons:- The menus are too long and not arranged as well as they could be.  Sony has a much better menu system on their Alpha cameras and the RX100; they should have used that same menu system on the NEX line.  Fortunately you can set the camera up so that you rarely need to delve into the menus.- The drawback of the large sensor is relatively large lenses (by mirrorless camera standards).  Other than the included kit lens, the lenses for this system tend to be larger than those for the Olympus, Panasonic, and Nikon competitors in the mirrorless camera segment.- With the included zoom lens, the camera has to apply a *lot* of distortion correction as you get to either extreme of the zoom.  That correction is done automatically for JPEG images (and most RAW software that supports the camera can do so as well) but you end up with images that suffer from loss of detail towards the edges.  This software correction is what makes compact lenses like the 16-50mm zoom possible and isn't confined to Sony.- Difficulties auto-focusing on fast moving subjects.  If you plan to do a lot of sports shooting, a D-SLR is still the better way to go.- The video suffers from moire (false color)  in some cases where there's a lot of repeating, fine detail in the shot.- The camera could use more user-configurable buttons.- No external microphone input for video.- If you zoom with the kit lens while taking video, the noise from the lens is very noticeable/annoying in the resulting video.- Like all electronic viewfinders, the refresh rate becomes very slow in low light.- No separate battery charger is included, so you have to charge the battery in-camera (meaning you can't be using the camera while charging a battery).  Fortunately cheap-but-good battery chargers are available here on Amazon.- The are some odd design choices with the camera.  For instance, when deciding you need to override the camera's exposure setting using exposure compensation, you'd want to be able to view the live histogram.  But, while you're adjusting the exposure compensation, all other data disappears from the screen.  So you need to make a guess with the exposure compensation, get out of that setting mode so you can see the live histogram, go back into exposure compensation if you didn't like what you saw, etc.  You sometimes wonder if the engineers who made the design choices ever take pictures.For me, the key to being happy with this camera is learning how to configure it to your liking as it takes forever to scroll through options in the very long menus.  Things you should learn from the manual as quickly as possible:- How to program the \"B\" soft button.  Use this for the setting you change most frequently that doesn't already have a dedicated control (I use it for while balance).- If you don't tend to use Automated Exposure lock, learn how to reprogram the AE button for a different setting.- How to program the \"fn\" button.  You can assign 6 (out of a possible 16) camera settings to this button.  When you press the button, those 6 choices will be shown across the bottom of the display and you can quickly select and change the one you want using the navigation controls.One more thing to do is to enable the quick navigation display.  The user manual doesn't really describe this, and I only know about it because the good folks on the forums at talknex dot com pointed me towards it.  You enable this by:1) Bring up the menu screen2) Select the 'Camera' menu3) Scroll down to the 'DISP' setting and select itYou'll now be shown a number of different display options.  Along with options like a histogram or a level, there's a choice called 'For Viewfinder' that's disabled by default.  Enable this option, then exit back to shooting mode.  Looking at the rear screen, press DISP repeatedly until you get a screen that shows various shooting parameters.  When this screen is displayed, you can press the 'fn' button and then move around this screen and select/change the various parameters using the navigation controls.  Why this extremely useful feature isn't described by the manual (or enabled by default) is beyond me.Annoyingly, not all camera functions can be accessed via the methods shown above.  For instance, I always reformat the memory card after downloading the photos (the card manufacturers recommend a 'format' rather than 'deleting' the files, as a reformat recreates the file system on the card and helps prevent corrupted data) but 'format' isn't a function that can be assigned/accessed via the methods listed above.  So I always have to navigate well down into the Settings menu to format the card.Pros and cons vs. other cameras I tried out:Sony NEX-7:  The -6 has a dedicated mode dial whereas the -7 doesn't (although some prefer the '7's \"tri-nav\" control system; for me the dedicated mode dial won out).  The -7 has higher stills resolution.  Menu systems are broadly similar (meaning not great on either one).  Bodies are almost identical.Sony NEX-5n:  The -5n is very similar (sharing the same sensor, menus, etc.) but lacks the -6's built in viewfinder.  The -5n's body is somewhat smaller.Olympus OMD-EM5:  The EM5 has the same resolution as the NEX-6 and produces stills that are very similar in quality.  The EM5 has inferior video quality with less detail and more compression artifacts.  The EM5's menus are (to my mind) worse than the NEX-6 and a major drawback.  Camera body size is similar although the EM5 feels much more like an old film camera (with it's SLR-like body design).  I found the EM5 difficult to hold comfortably as there's no grip.Panasonic G6:  The G6 produces files of the same resolution as the NEX-6 but its sensor produces more noise and RAW images do not provide as much highlight/shadow recovery as the NEX-6.  I think the Panasonic menus are better.  The G6's video is somewhat better than the NEX, not suffering from moire nearly as much.  The G6's body is somewhat more chunky.Panasonic GH3:  The GH3 apparently shares the same sensor as the OMD-EM5 above and so also produces still images that are very close in quality to those of the NEX-6.  The GH3's video is outstanding -- if you're interested in video first, stills second then this is the mirrorless camera to get.  The GH3's body is much chunkier than the NEX-6.  Menus are well laid out and there are a large number of configurable external buttons.  (If size and cost hadn't been issues, I might have purchased the GH3 rather than the NEX-6).", "Date": "August 20, 2013"}, {"Title": "Review from a Canon 5D3 User", "Author": "BattleGnome", "ReviewID": "R21GBJU2A46L5I", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "When I first got this camera I was a little unsure, but after using it for a week I have fallen in love. Wow, it takes amazing pictures, and has really nice video capability as well.Here are some things that have been pleasant surprises.1. The 16-50mm kit lens is better than I expected. I have a Canon 5D3 with the 24-105mm F4 lens, and I took some test shots to compare (16mm on NEX 6 is 24mm on 5D3). If you shoot at F8, it is at least close in capability. The kit lens is fine for shooting outdoors, or if you have a tripod. It is also quite good for video. I wasn't expecting much from this lens and thought I might sell it, but after using it awhile I have decided to keep it. It is small and low profile, and is good for outdoor stuff.2. EVF with Focus Peaking - The electronic view finder is amazing in my opinion, and also has a feature I didn't know about called \"peaking\". When you manual focus, it puts a red halo around the parts of the picture that are in focus. Allows you to easily get perfect focus (as long as object is not moving). Autofocus is pretty solid as well.3. Video and microphone. The video on this thing is outstanding, and the microphone far exceeded my expectations. I do not think you will need an external mic unless you are doing professional videos. Also, 24p with quality lenses, high ISO, and video auto focus. You definitely don't need a separate camcorder!4. Ergonomics are great. The button layout and menus were very well thought out. I can get to everything really fast, and have no complaints whatsoever. Changing shutter speed, aperture, ISO, flash settings, focus point, shooting mode (timers etc), is super easy and fast.5. Sony 35mm F1.8 lens. I bought this lens with the camera and love it. Takes awesome pictures! Will use this lens most of the time.Some minor gripes.1. Battery life is not great in my opinion. After reading up on this, I believe it is true of all mirrorless cameras. I do think you need to get a second battery and an external charger to get the most out of this camera.2. Wireless is useless. I thought it would be cool to just download pictures via wireless to my Mac, but it is kludgey in my opinion. I got it working wirelessly, but think it is easier to just plug in the camera.3. Apps are terrible and *expensive*. I was kind of excited about some of the apps, but did not realize they cost money. $5 to $10 each! I don't like that.4. Wireless and apps both are *slow*. Took forever for menus to load, and sometimes they fail and you have to start over.The above gripes will not take away from your enjoyment of this camera. You can safely ignore the app and wireless features, and everything else works great. Get a second battery and you're good to go. The built-in flash is \"good enough\".", "Date": "June 7, 2013"}, {"Title": "Best NEX yet", "Author": "Tom S", "ReviewID": "RP7ZHBW9JIEAU", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I am glad I waited until the NEX-6 to upgrade from my NEX-5.  The NEX-6 provides a great viewfinder, flash, nice mode dial, a cool level-indicator to help you avoid tilted photos and digital zoom.  Some people criticize digital zoom since it is only in-camera cropping, but it really is better than post-cropping since the exposure and focus is based on the zoomed image.  After many test shots, I found the new 16-50 power zoom lens is sharper than the old Sony 18-55 zoom.  Sony sold a lot of the 18-55 zoom lenses and they should be ashamed of that lens since is was very soft, very large, and rather slow.  The 3200-6400 ISO noise seems slightly better in the NEX-6 and the auto-ISO now extends  up to 3200 which comes in handy.  Like other reviewers mentioned, the WiFi function takes a lot of button pushing, but it works and really not too hard to set up.  The Android/iPhone remote control app is very cool; it provides a live viewfinder on your phone, with exposure control, and you can take a photo by pressing the button on your phone - this is so much better than the ten-second dash to beat the self-timer.  The NEX-6 shoots multiple frames much faster than the NEX-5, this makes shooting with exposure bracketing faster and it is a big improvement for HDR shooting since it reduces the risk of ghost images resulting from motion in the frame.  The phase detect auto focus is fast and reliable.  Some reviewers have commented about the image in the viewfinder sometimes seems dim or off-color; it seems fine to me.  Maybe the other reviewers did not understand that the viewfinder shows you what you will see in you photo and if the exposure is too dim or the white-balance is wrong then you will see the bad results in the viewfinder.  So, I think the viewfinder does what it should.  The auto-whitebalance is as good as any camera I have used.  The dual-control power zoom is easy to control for both still and video and makes it much easier to smoothly zoom the lens for video.  However, the zoom lever is not progressive; it has only one zoom speed. In addition to the passable paper user guide, there is an expanded user manual provided on a CD-ROM.My main complaint is that such a sophisticated and feature loaded camera like the NEX-6 should have user settable favorite/custom settings.  There is no way to save the current configuration of settings as user defined custom setting.  But there is hope since the NEX-6 has downloadable apps and maybe SONY will add a Custom Setting app for the NEX-6.  Only SONY provides the downloadable apps, so I hope they get busy and provide some useful new apps.  The other thing on my Sony wish list would be a good quality, compact E-mount power zoom from about 60-180mm.Overall, I am very pleased with the NEX-6 and I have no problems with its operation.", "Date": "February 17, 2013"}, {"Title": "Sony NEX 6, what a great camera.", "Author": "yaseen", "ReviewID": "RCGML50RJEHRZ", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "Okay, first of all I am not a professional photographer. I am just a guy who likes to take good quality pictures without worrying about taking a special class in photography, reading books, or spending hours if not days reading the manual. I owned a Panasonic ZS7 after reading all the great reviews about it. However, I was never satisfied. It has a very slow shutter speed, an okay picture quality, and poor quality software (I will never buy a professional software to edit my pictures. If the camera did not come with one, then I have to live with my raw pictures).Couple of months ago I decided that it's time to upgrade, but I have no interest in carrying a bulky DSLR camera or hiring someone to carry it for me (The Sony A77 weight is 5 pounds with the lens!!!??). So I decided to look for a compact camera that has the DSLR features and capability. After looking all over the internet and considering every single review out there, I found out that the NEXs are the best fit for my needs.I waited until NEX 6 was out and I contacted Michael Mckeem (the first to review this camera on Amazon). I was concerned about the slow AF in the new 16-50 lens and its overall performance and quality (remember the first camera in the NEX family to get the 16-50 lens is NEX 6). His response was very helpful and I was really close to make the final decision.  I went back again and start looking for more reviews and pictures other have taken and posted online (This is a $1000 investment and I had to be careful). Then I decided it is time to get one.I received my camera about two weeks ago. The day it arrived I took it with me to an international festival we had in town and start playing around (remember, I am not professional and I do not know how to set the camera manually to take good pictures, I mainly leave it on Auto and let it does it things). I went back home and start viewing the pictures and I was stunned by quality and color richness.Until that moment I have not touch or play with any of the manual settings of the camera. The next day my wife was baking some cookies for thanksgiving and I had to stay with the girls out in the back yard (I live in the woods and my backyard is about 2 acres). I started taking pictures and playing with the settings since I have a lot of time in hand. That's when I became obsessed with this camera and its capability.I do not want to go any further with my review because first of all I am not professional and second I am not familiar with the terminology used to describe my feeling about this camera. However, I want to tell those who are interested in this camera the following: if you want a camera that can give you more if you ask for it, NEX 6 is the one. Also, do not worry about the limited E-mount lenses in the market because you can always buy an adaptor. I bought one for EOS lenses and I ordered a canon 70-300 III USM lens. I will update my review once I receive it and start taking pictures with it.Over all, NEX 6 is a bit expensive, but you get what you paid for. The software is amazing and it will do a great job editing your pictures. I disagree with those who said it is hard to play with the settings, if I can do it in two weeks, you can do it in a couple of days.", "Date": "November 27, 2012"}, {"Title": "Nearly Perfect in Every Aspect", "Author": "Emoya", "ReviewID": "R1FC3UXUEI95DM", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "This camera is one of the most enjoyable cameras I've ever used. This is my first Sony Nex and I have to say that I am very impressed by what Sony has done. I've always read the positives and negatives about the Sony Nex Line, and I can't speak for the other Nex cameras, but this camera hits the spot on ergonomics, functionality, and size. I am not going to go into too much technical specifics since there is plenty written about it on here and other places, but I will outline what I think is great about the camera.For one the size of the Nex 6 is terrific, especially with the pancake power zoom lens. However, I don't believe this camera to be pocketable, not in any pants at least, maybe a coat pocket, and even if you could fit them in some pants or coat pocket they would feel very uncomfortable. Nonetheless, the Nex 6 is still smaller, lighter and more compact than a DSLR.The NEX 6 feels great in the hands and it does remind me of shooting with a DSLR. The large grip is phenomenal and feels very secure in ones hand.The tilting screen is very useful, as is the wheel to control either aperture or shutter speed. The Nex 7 has an additional dial that might be more convenient to some, however, since I mainly shoot in aperture priority or shutter priority I don't miss it. But I can see how those who shoot fully manual might miss that other wheel.Sony's menu system has always been criticized for being cumbersome, but the FN (function button) eliminates the use of Sony's flawed menu system. It is probably my favorite feature on the camera. Pressing the FN button pulls up a menu page that has 5 different camera elements. The elements can be ISO, AWB, metering, etc.; customized by the user and easily accessed by a button makes this feature a joy to use.The Sony Nex is fun to use because everything feels natural and well thought out. After just using the camera for a couple of hours I felt I knew where everything was and did not need to pull away from the viewfinder to see where the buttons where located.Oh, and the viewfinder is great. I can't attest to this, but many photography experts say that Sony has the best electronic viewfinder in the industry. And the Sony Nex 6 does not deviate from having a terrific EVF.The only reason the camera did not get a 5 star review is because the sharpness of the 16-50mm lens is simply not as sharp as some other lenses I have recently been accustom to. I used to read that the Nex line Achilles heel was it's lack of great lens. I am not sure if that is true or not since I have seen pictures with other lenses that seem to be very sharp, and there is also the use of lens adapters that seem to work very well. But the 16-50mm is not a terribly sharp lens considering that I am using an APS-C sensor camera. So, for increased sharpness an additional investment might be needed, but that really depends how satisfied the user is with the sharpness of the kit lens.", "Date": "May 27, 2014"}, {"Title": "Great Mirrorless camera!", "Author": "PeteSter! \"Pete\"", "ReviewID": "R3D8ET67F1EYR", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I consider myself an \"occassional amateur photographer\" in the sense that I love photography & take interest in understanding the settings like exposure, ISO and aperture but don't spend and hours everyday for this hobby.

It takes good enough pictures and is with me all the time. I decided it was time to ditch the SLR for a newer technology - the mirrorless.The NEX-6 is a perfect combination of size and quality. Although some people may still swear by the \"SLR\" I can't see a significant different between a Consumer level SLR and this camera. A professional $10K SLR may perform better but remember this is a consumer level mirrorless and needs to be compared to an equivalent SLR. The pictures are amazing - especially the night shots. The camera has a lot of controls similar to what you would find on an SLR and it would help to learn about where to find each one of them. Its a matter of developing your motor reflexes to reach each of the controls and once that happens, you would never miss your DSLR.

The APS-C image sensor is at the higher end for the price and weight, and produces images on par with even mid-range DSLR's.  The auto-focus is fast and even I, a heavy manual-focus user sometimes use it over manual.  The focus peaking also is an excellent addition, and aids the process of focusing.The camera fares well in most lighting conditions, and remains stable up to ~12800ISO, and even 25600, depending on the lighting condition.  There is zero shutter lag, and there is a small start up time (some reviewers have disagreed).  The build quality is top notch, made up of metal, and only plastic in the battery area.  The viewfinder is an excellent viewfinder, and although electric is clear and sharp.  The LCD is also extremely good, despite the lack of touchscreen and offers a wide viewing angle and sharp resolution.  The viewfinder also automatically switches to LCD and vice versa, which is neat.  Video is excellent, and due to 60p video, it takes smooth video, which can be slowed down effectively in Post-Preduction (After Effects/twixtor.)  Even without a microphone, the sound quality is decent, free of noise and distortion.  The only caveat I had with this camera is that the battery is horrific.  It lasts barely 300 shots on viewfinder mode, and ~200 on LCD mode.  To solve this issue, I bought a 3rd party battery, and now can take >400 shots on LCD mode.

I mostly used the 35mm, as the pancake zoom seems to be a little buggy. First of all, it takes a while to startup, as it seems to need to go through the focal range first before allowing me to use it. Also, every now and then, the lens won't startup correctly, so I have to either turn the camera off and back on, or I have to take the battery out and put it back in. I don't have this problem with the 35mm. Eventually, the lens just wasn't recognized by the camera anymore, so I had to mail the lens in for warranty repair service. Haven't gotten it back so I'll update later when I get the new pancake to see if it fares any better. The camera body, however, has been wonderful. The eyepiece does come off easily and I lost it very quickly. The swivel screen has been very useful, but will only help with landscape oriented photos. The dial on top will control depending on what mode you are on. If you are in Aperture priority, it will control your aperture. If you are on Shutter priority, your shutter speed. If in program mode, you will see that it changes both, keeping exposure the same. This, to me, is the perfect way to shoot. You have control over aperture and/or shutter speed, and need only adjust exposure compensation. Very useful and quick. It does take longer to power on than I'd like, and it isn't quite as fast in focusing as a DSLR. But I'm not a snapshooter anyway, I like to take time and deliberate w/ my photos. One thing I do wish was improved, is when I'm using the MF, it zooms in so I can see clearly what I'm focusing on, however, it takes a good 2 sec. before it zooms back to normal view. I wish it zoomed in for only a split second until I was done adjust the ring, and it would immediately go back to normal view. Often times, I will set it on AF, and adjust with the MF ring to make sure focus is correct, but then I have to wait 2 secs for it to go back to normal view to make sure composition is correct. My last complaint I have is that movies and images are not in the same pool under playback mode. You have to switch between viewing all your movies, and all your images. And it's not easy to switch between the two either. Often times, I forget I even have movies on the memory card because of this. Also, there is a separate pool for each movie format as well.

I was between NEX 7 and NEX 6. And definitely I go with the NEX 6 it is much more newer, the wifi function is fantastic. Also the camera makes a great work in night situation as many reviews mentioned.The videos made in 1080 are incredible. I did many movies in the San Francisco pier and works like a charm, very impressed. Before that I read many reviews, comparing the video results with another camera and I can say that NEX 6 make me proud.About the photos, it is totally 5 star. The focus mode is amazing.This camera make me a PRO NOW. :):)I attached a video made in the san francisco pier - you can see the alcatraz in the background.Just for curiosity, the song is \"Peter And Gordon - A World Without Love\"", "Date": "May 29, 2013"}, {"Title": "Great camera", "Author": "ri", "ReviewID": "R2TNWGA649XVJ9", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "The Sony NEX 6 is a really nice camera.

The image quality is outstanding and this camera will do everything that my much larger SLT camera will do.I had liked the concept of the smaller NEX series from the outset. What made me a buyer was the addition of a view finder on the NEX 6. The other models although nice were too hard to view when in a bright situation, I seldom use the screen to line of a shot.The one thing that I don't like is how the SD card fits in, it is in a tough position and difficult to remove.

The camera image quality is AWESOME!!! I have a Canon 7D and purchased this one because it will fit in my pocket and still shoot quality images in low light conditions.  The image quality in low light far exceeded my expectations. At this point, my 7D is my backup and this will be my primary.  I used it inside and outside in the cold (-5 to 15F) and it just kept shooting.The only negatives are related to the battery.  The battery that comes with it doesn't last very long.  You MUST buy a supplemental battery or two or three.  The other qualm is it doesn't come with an external battery charger.  So, to charge the battery, you must charge the battery with the camera connected via USB. Several of the batteries come with chargers, so that is a good way around the problem.One other thing worth mentioning, the 16-50mm Power Zoom uses a 40.5mm filter, so don't forget to purchase it as your buying the camera.  Most local camera stores don't stock it.  The 55-200mm uses a standard 49mm which is available at your local camera store.", "Date": "March 24, 2013"}, {"Title": "NEX 6 is a Gem", "Author": "ZIJI", "ReviewID": "R2HLG2S5LU1RQF", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "The NEX 6 for me has the best ergonomics in its size class .

Great camera but it was time to move on.  I'm not currently in photography to make money.  I just enjoy it.  I was thinking about getting the Nikon D7000 but I couldn't ignore all the reviews and talk about the NEX line.  Particularly the NEX 6 and 7.  I never would have seen myself buying one of these so called \"serious little\" cameras but Sony is getting right!  I'm not going to talk about the specs because that's already available on the specs page.  I will tell you I love this camera.It gives me the control I'm used to with a DSLR plus a bunch of new features like wifi and the ability to load photo apps.  Sure, the user interface for the wifi and apps aren't perfect, as you probably read in other reviews, but it does what it says and I like it.  Being able to use my iPhone as a remote control is great. (It works on other phones too)  No need to buy a separate remote.  Additionally, you can download your photos to your computer over wifi.  It's slower than using a USB or card reader but it works.The love the display screen.  You can see what you're doing if shooting angles over head or below.  The screen doesn't flip all the way up for self portraits like the 5R but I've got my iPhone remote control app for that.The low-light (high ISO) capability is great in my opinion and the built in flash actually does a really good job when you need it.  And the flash moves!  I can hold it back with one finger and bounce the light.I'm happy with the new 16-50mm power zoom.  Good range for everyday shots of scenery or friends and family.  I do miss my 50mm f1.8 but it's available for the E-mount when I'm ready to pick it up.The NEX-6 is small but not too small.  The grip on this little thing makes it comfortable to use, even for my big hands.My bottom line:  This is an amazing little camera and I'm very happy with it.  Sure, it won't replace the pro/full frame DLSRs but that should be obvious.  Sony is raising the bar for mirrorless cameras!", "Date": "January 5, 2013"}, {"Title": "Lens malfunction after two days", "Author": "John C. Lynch", "ReviewID": "R81MBWKANKQQW", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "I invested a lot of energy and time before buying this camera and was convinced that this was the one I wanted.  I spent the extra dough for the NEX-6 because I wanted the electronic viewfinder and I liked all the control options.  And I was very happy that it came with a 16-50mm lens -- a perfect (for my uses) range for the main lens I'd be using.  I took about 300 photos in 3 days and I was ecstatic with the quality and the speed and the options and... everything!  The camera is awesome.  And then I got the camera out yesterday to take a macro photo.  I wanted to make sure I was focusing on the right thing, so I used the hybrid auto focus feature that lets you fine tune the focusing after the auto focus does its job (what a neat feature -- I love that!).  But after I snapped the shot, the lens froze.  Wouldn't zoom, wouldn't focus.  Dead.  And the camera now says, \"Cannot recognize lens.  Attach it properly.\"  And that's it.  Camera is now dead and needs to be returned.  That's fine -- Amazon will take it back and replace it.  But do I want a replacement?  Did I just get a dud?  Or will this happen again?  Maybe not in three days again, but maybe in a year or two.  How much confidence should I have in the lens?  The build quality of the camera itself seems solid.  The power zoom?  Not so clear.UPDATE:  I received a new NEX-6 from Amazon within 2 days of my having notified them that the first one was defective.  The second one has been trouble free -- I have done everything I could think of to replicate the circumstances that caused the lens to fail the first time and I have had no problems.  I'm still nervous about the lens, but the camera itself is fantastic.  And I got the Sigma 30mm f2.8 EX DN, which is a fantastic lens.  That lens with the Sony NEX-6 body reminds me of my first SLR camera and the thrill of learning the basics of photography.  I'm raising my star rating from 1 to 4 stars because the camera is awesome, but I still have concerns about the kit lens.", "Date": "January 13, 2013"}, {"Title": "4-star body 2-star lens", "Author": "Dan", "ReviewID": "R1SLOZL3L0DXES", "Overall": "3.0", "Content": "Sony Nex 6 with 16-50 kit lens.I am an armature and had owned Canons. When comparing indoor shots (with flash, 1/60 shutter) with the Canon P&S; (G11), I am surprised that the G11 yields better (better color, resolution and contrast) JPEGs. When flash is not used, the Nex 6 wins in every aspect due to better high (1600) ISO picture quality. I am not trying to compare apple to orange since the 2 cameras are different classes. I believe the 16-50 lens quality couple with the in-camera lens correction (reduce lens distortion in sacrifice of picture sharpness) has hampered the Nex 6 producing higher quality photos. Don't know what lens to buy for the Nex at this moment. Perhaps third party lens (Nikon, Lecia) with lens adapter.Overall, the Nex 6 body is pretty good (solid build, resonable focus speed, focus peaking, good EVF etc..). However, I miss the 2 custom shooting modes and much longer battery life in my G11. Hope Sony will provide firmware Apps to allow the two intelligent shooting modes (in the PASM dial) to be converted to custom modes.Once a while during power down, the Nex 6 lens takes few seconds to retract.

I will probably pick up several primes for it as well. You may be wondering why I only gave it 4 stars after stating that I love the camera. Well, I am not sure about quality of the camera. After only using it a few times and having it just over 1 month, the flash popup button has decided to stop popping up the flash when pressed. This makes me wonder what other things will go wrong with it. I've had my Canon 7D for over 2 years and have had no problems with it at all.

I have previously owned a NEX3 and a X-E2. Even though the X-E2 was a very nice camera I still felt it was a poor value and ended up returning it. After having used the a7R for a day I am sold on the Sony line of cameras but not ready to jump into the a7 line yet as there are a couple kinks that need to be worked out.I bought this camera used off ebay for 600 dollars with a the kit lens. I think this camera is inferior but comparable to the X-E2 from Fuji.The kit lens feels like what I am used to from a kit lens, kinda cheap and it is weird having a power zoom on the side of the lens. Photos come out good but not great. I also bought the sigma 19, 30 and 60mm lenses. So far the 60mm art series is pretty exceptional, at ISO 100 I am getting some very crisp shots that I think are slightly better than my old 7D.The reason I traded in the Fuji was the AutoFocus (1 AF Point at a time) and that I have to go through a menu to change the ISO. This camera does have dual contrast detect and phase detect like the XE-2 has but this one does have multi point focus. Although the Fuji does have many AF points you only can choose one at a time. There were situations where the camera would hunt for focus when the point I had chosen was in a dark spot or a dark flat wall. The Sony like other cameras would then use another point to lock onto. Unfortunately both cameras require you to go through a small menu to change the ISO.It seems that the image quality of the X-E2 is slightly better than this camera and does handle higher ISO's better than the Sony. One of the reason that I made the change from APS to full frame is that I hated how the 7D has high noise at anything above 3200, this camera is the same, at 3200 shots are pretty noisy, I have not shot above that so far.I like the menu layout of the X-E2 and my Canon cameras much more, the menus on the NEX line are more cartoonish for my taste and slower to use as there are only 6 icons and some of the icons have a rather long list of options. I would have much preferred several tabs and each tab has a shorter list of options. I am more of a manual shooter so once the settings are in I don't change them often, I only want quick access to Shutter, Aperture and ISO.Overall I am satisfied with the picture quality from this camera and I like that lenses are cheaper than regular SLR cameras and with a cheap adapter I can use all my old Minolta lenses with this camera. This camera does struggle some at higher ISO settings and the build quality is not as nice as some other cameras.For the money, being 800 dollars cheaper than the X-E2 and still about 150 cheaper than the X-E1 I think this is a much better option. I also like that this camera is the ONLY camera in the NEX line that has a standard size hot shoe. No need for a stupid adapter if I want to use my pocketwizards or other standard sized hot shoe attachment. The viewfinder is usable but so far with mirrorless cameras I find I barely ever use them. AF is great and using MF focus on this camera is easy as well as it zooms to full resolution and it is easy to set razor sharp focus.I never bought this camera to replace my 5D but it is nice backup that is very usable and can turn out some excellent images. On top of that it is small, light weight and lenses are cheap for it. I carry this camera, the kit lens and three sigma lenses and it all weight less than my SLR body with a prime lens on it.

The camera is capable of great photos.  I appreciate its small size and light weight.  I have no complaints about the kit lens, which I use all the time.  I purchased a Sigma 30mm f/2.8 lens for the Sony E mount, but I found I didn't use it, so I sold it.  I would be interested in the extra speed and image stabilization of the Sony 35mm f/1.8 OSS prime lens, but the price is high, even in used condition.I have found this generally excellent camera to have five flaws, and two of them are major.  First, the battery life is terrible.  With the official Sony NP-FW50 battery in place, I use the EVF on every shot and rarely use the built-in flash, and I am lucky to get 100 shots on a fully charged battery, although the camera is rated at 270 shots using the EVF and 360 shots using the LCD.  I tried a replacement Sony NP-FW50 battery and an off-brand Wasabi battery sold on Amazon with no better results.  So I always have to carry at least one and often two extra batteries to make it through one day of shooting.Second, the camera has six sets of menus, and most of them are reasonable in length, but the setup menu has 67 choices, and navigating that menu is in no way intuitive.  In fairness to Sony, there are enough buttons that once you make your initial settings and assign certain functions to the Fn button and to two other customizable buttons, you rarely have to resort to the menus.  A firmware update could help simplify and better organize the menus.Third, and far more minor, it is difficult to grasp and remove the memory card without dropping it, so I recommend always doing so over a table or desk to keep your memory card off the floor.Fourth, I find that the vivid setting under Sony's creative styles doesn't boost the colors very much; the difference is hardly noticeable.  It's nothing like the boost you get from a Nikon DSLR's vivid colors.  In general, when shooting outdoors, Sony's colors don't quite match the brightness and intensity of Nikon's colors, although indoors the Sony colors are just fine.Fifth, you can't play back both your still photos and your videos.  You have to go into the menu system to choose either still photo playback or video playback.  I have not encountered this with any other camera.So much for what I don't like.  This is a compact, fast operating, versatile camera with a great EVF and LCD, good exposure and autofocus systems, and a built-in flash you can bounce, and it takes clear sharp photos that you can enlarge to 16 x 20 at least.

From a photography standpoint, this is a no-brainer; more so if you are a father with small children. You can crank the ISO and shutter speed and the articulating LCD makes it AWESOME! I have beautiful pics of my beautiful little girls.But I like to shoot video from time to time and, until this week, generally enjoyed my high-end Canon camcorder. But, alas the battery was dead, and I was forced to try my nex 6. I'm glad I did. I'm selling my Canon camcorder (might do b-roll duty)The video quality was simply jaw dropping, particularly in low light. I had the shutter speed set to 1/125 with the ISO moving between 800 and 3200. It all looked fantastic. (1/125 was because I was also shooting at 60 FPS, at 1080P. I would lower this to 1/60 if I was shooting at 30 FPS. I like shooting at 60 FPS because there's more opportunity for well focused screen shots)So you *can* get ride of extra cameras and use only the nex 6 for video and audio. OK? I couldn't find this info anywhere (youtube will cover the how-to well, like what shutter speed to use and why, and using the creative mode \"portrait\" with detuned sharpening and contrast)But! Here's what I noticed:1) Focus is tough. Go manual, stop down your aperture if you can. I'm shooting kids (that's funny, \"shooting kids\"), so focus was a challenge. Focus on clothes was great due to the contrast, but the eyes are all sadly soft. Lesson learned. I'll try to stop down to F4 or better, up the light, and use manual focus as much as I can (this is more work than a camcorder in a sense, and totally worth it)2) The audio is pure crap. Voice is really, surprising clear and audible, but there's this really weird background noise (on my sigma lens anyway) and occasional dropouts. So you'll want the ECM-XYST1M microphone for the nex6. I ordered it - reviews claim it to be totally outstanding.3) Think about your lens.. and the lame 16-50 kits lens might be PERFECT. I used a sigma prime, the 19mm, just because I'm lazy (it was closest) and because the sigma is so sharp (spectacular lens). I also like how Sigma was F2.8, which I needed. The kit lens would be better, for one, it has zoom ability. Secondly you don't have to turn the lens to zoom, you merely push a button. Thirdly the kit lens, the lowly disrespected kit lens, has optical stabilization.So, the next time, I'll use manual focus, add my new mic, and use the kits lens. In addition, since I'm fond of 60FPS, I'll try to up the light too so I can stop down once more for greater depth of field.Speaking of depth of field, my fat, blonde, mega-cute 4 year old girl - she's adorable - I'm blabbing - but I shot her talking at the lens, and everything behind her is blurred. Very profession looking, really pulls the view attention to her chubby sweet face. Does *not* look like home video. Too bad the audio is \"poo butt\" as she would likely denounce it.OK, fwiw, I use final cut pro X, and it had no problem ingesting the video and editing it is pure joy.The camera is worth for video alone - who knew!?

My daughter is 3. There is a height disparity (though sometimes she says \"I'm almost as tall as you, Daddy\"). My primary camera is a Canon EOS 5D Mark III. To get pictures of my daughter's world with the Canon I am either bending over (don't try it when you're 49!) or down on my knees. The NEX-6 with the flip-up rear LCD is more like a Rollei or Hasselblad with their waist-level viewfinders. One ends up with a lot of pictures from a very different perspective than one would get with a standard camera.Video quality is superb, another critical parent-cam feature (\"Come over to my house and let me show you 600 hours of unedited footage of my cute daughter!\").The flash exposure system is inferior to that on $100 film point-and-shoot cameras of the 1980s, which used the focussed distance and a fixed flash output to set an appropriate aperture. I'm not sure what the Sony is doing but the result usually looks as though you had set off a magnesium distress flare in your living room. (In fairness to Sony, given that the flash is flexibly mounted the simplest distance-based exposure system wouldn't work if the photographer has chosen to bend the flash up for bouncing.)As others have noted, the battery life is short. It is just barely adequate for following a kid around for 3-5 hours. If you're planning to travel with this camera buy at least two extra batteries and come up with an elaborate protocol for charging. Also remember that despite the standard micro-USB connector the camera cannot be charged from a standard USB charger. It needs a minimum of about 2 amps at 5V (a charger for an iPad or big Android tablet should work, as does the supplied Sony charger); the typical phone charger supplies 0.5 to 1 amp.I haven't ended up using the eye-level viewfinder much. The rear LCD is typically crowded with text overlaid on the edges of the frame. Unconsciously I have ended up taking a lot of pictures that required post-exposure cropping. The composition that I wanted was what the camera was displaying on the center 75 percent of the screen (the part not cluttered with text). You can turn off some of the text but then you have no way of knowing remaining battery life or other critical information. The camera needs a mode where a 100% preview of the image is displayed on the rear LCD with text underneath or alongside. The Sony RX100 is better in this respect so maybe there is hope from a future firmware upgrade.Given that this camera costs less than any of the Canon L lenses that one typically uses with an EOS system, I am pretty amazed by the quality.

This camera has many of the features of a DSLR but is much more portable and will be easier to use for most people.  It is the perfect size... not too large and not pocket-size.  It just feels right in your hands.The first thing I noticed after turning it on and navigating through some menus was how easy to understand the menu system and options are.  The screen shows you information about each option as you navigate to it, so it is easy to just pick up and shoot great photos without opening a manual.  While I am on the subject of the manual, the PDF manual is excellent and makes it easy to find the information you need.There are some neat features on this camera.  One of my favorites is the \"background defocus\" function that de-emphasizes the background and focuses more on the subject.  It makes your photos look like they were professionally taken.  While the camera makes it easy to shoot great photos, you still have full manual control.  You can also take 1080p video and panoramic photos, both of which work well.I love the built-in Wi-Fi so you can transfer and view photos on your computer or smartphone wirelessly.  There are also downloadable apps for the camera that adds various functions like retouching and additional effects, as well as an app to remotely control the camera from your smartphone.  However, not all of the apps are free and some of the cooler ones (like the Time-lapse app) are as much as 10 dollars.  You would expect that a camera of this quality and price range would include these apps at no additional cost and not nickle and dime you on the extras... oh well.  You can download these apps through your computer and upload them to the camera using the included cable, or you can download the apps directly to the camera over Wi-Fi, but both methods require that you register on their website for an account first.  The included software package for your computer is good for viewing, converting, sharing, and tracking all of your photos.The OLED screen on the camera is so much better than the standard LED screens.  It is much easier to see in bright light and is crystal clear.  If you prefer to use the viewfinder, there is a heads-up display for your current settings like aperture and the shutter speed.This is a great camera and a nice step up from your basic digital one without getting in to DSLR territory.", "Date": "June 3, 2013"}, {"Title": "Amazing Camera", "Author": "Anita E.

Their \"universal\" hotshoe is anything but.  I tried five or six different external flash units on it and none worked.  Finally had to order a Sony flash for $350!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!  Will receive it tomorrow.  If it doesn't work, then the hotshoe is defective and I'll be returning the camera.  Apparently I'm not the only user who has had problems trying to find an external flash for use on this model.  Buyer beware.  Otherwise it's a terrific camera.  LOVE having the EVF built-in.  WiFi feature is way to cumbersome to bother with.  Have to VERY SLOWLY enter a password each time you try to use it.  So silly.  If there is a way to retain that data in the camera then I MIGHT use this feature, but I got so frustrated trying to use it the first couple times I just quit trying.  Easy enough to remove the SD card and stick it in my PC for uploading photos/videos.  One feature change I really like is that I can now remove the battery and SD card without having to remove the tripod release plate.  That's very slick.  Image quality, of course, is outstanding due to the large \"DSLR\" sensor used in this camera.  The camera is small, lightweight, and other than the placement of the video button I love how it works.  Just very angry over not being able to use non-Sony flash units in the \"universal\" hotshoe....UPDATE 5.17.2013:  After determining that the hotshoe on my prior camera was fried I returned it to Amazon (thank you very much!), and bought a new NEX-6 from them.  This time around I decided to use ONLY Sony flash products, so I bought the Sony ADP-MAA adapter and the little Sony HVL-F20AM flash.  I do a lot of real estate photoshoots, and while this little flash DID work on the NEX-6 just fine I felt the light output was inconsistent.  Some of that was my fault for shooting too soon before the flash had fully recharged. Unlike the similar flash I had on my NEX-F3, this one runs off two AAA batteries, not the camera battery, and it seemed to take longer to recycle.  However, even when it was fully recharged between shots, I found the output inconsistent.  So I bit the bullet, returned this flash and spend $348 for the HVL-F43AM much larger, heavier flash, and WAYYYY better flash.  And OMG do I ever LOVE this flash!  It is by far the best flash I've ever owned or used, including my old Nikon SB600.  The F43 uses four AA batteries, but a single charge seems to last forever.  I'll post a more detailed review of this flash on it elsewhere.BOTTOM LINE:  This is THE best camera and best flash I've ever owned, period.  I bought the 16mm-50mm power zoom lens with the camera and like it very much although I find I use manual zooming way more than the power zoom feature because it's so easy to use.  I also kept and regularly use my Sony 16mm f/2.8 \"pancake\" lens with the Sony VCLECU1 High Definition Wide Angle Conversion Lens, a terrific combination for real estate interiors.  If my math is correct that combination provides me with the equivalent of an 18mm lens in 35mm camera terms!  And I use my Sony 55mm-210mm lens for portraits and outside where I need a longer lens or more bokeh.  With this system I am a VERY happy camper now.  I truly do LOVE the NEX-6.  It provides me with DSLR image quality in a camera not much better than many point and shoot models!  And it comes with the best Electronic View Finder I've ever seen BUILT-IN!  For me, this camera blows away DSLR's in the same price range, and while I've had many Nikon cameras over the years, as well as many other brands, e.g., Leica, Panasonic, Canon, other Sony's, etc., I like this one better than all of them!", "Date": "April 17, 2013"}, {"Title": "Great little camera", "Author": "Georgina \"tville\"", "ReviewID": "R1M00GTF1VN67Z", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "This really is a great little camera.

Received it quickly and have been playing with it for about a week. I have been researching on a replacement of my Canon XSI that is about 4 years old. I have the lastest iPhone that can take great videos but I thought switch from camera to iPhone may not be practical to catch the moment some time.Considered T4i which is a very good camera also and would be a big upgrade from the XSI. But I wanted a more portable camera because I travel abroad during summer a lot. The 16-50 lens will lack the zoom like the 18-135 kit lens T4i has, but it is much smaller and better than my old 18-55, especially for the wider view and portability.I agree with other reviewers who give this camera 5 stars on most of the things they feel. It does hit the sweet spot for my use. The camera has great low light performance, fast auto focusing, and the speed priority continuous shooting is a blast. I used a SanDisk 32GB Extreme Pro 95MB/S, and it clears the buffer in about just a couple of seconds and you can start the bursting again. Really amazing! I managed to capture about 200 shots in less than one minute.Also considered Panasonic G5 (almost bought it if not seeing Sony is releasing the NEX-6 in November). G5 is a great camera itself with fast burst speed, touch screen, and video. But size and style wise, I like NEX-6, which my wife likes its sleek looking as well. She can put it in her bag without adding any bulk.There are a lot of nice features that have been discussed in other reviews. I like the function of using the back dial to zoom in and zoom out which basically allow you to operate the zooming with one hand easiy. Yes, I can do this with two buttons on Canon XSI too but it is not as neat as NEX-6. There are other functions like Wi-Fi which I consider is not the primary factor in purchasing a camera, but it does add convenience. Connected iPhone to NEX-6 and uploaded pictures to iPhone, and used iPhone to remote control the shutter.It is the first time I use an EVF so it does take some time to get used to. Then you will appreciate that it gives real time feedback of how things are going to look like in the picture before taking the shot.Had some reservations with the battery life, but the battery actually works pretty good for taking over 300 ~ 400 shots easily (not using much flash though). Add you can easilly get a lot more if you shoot in burst mode. You do have to fully charge it at least twice before the battery becomes stable, i.e., holds charge much longer. Have left the battery in the camera for about three days, and it still showed 100% charge.

You can get pro quality pictures from this camera and with some tweaks, you can do pro photo shoots as well. The problem is the hot shoe is not exactly standard. It will fire any standard flash in manual mode which am fine with but the shoe it self is shorter than a normal hot shoe foot so your flash foot hangs off a little and does not go on 100% on but goes on enough to make contact to work. The current flash that sony has cost as much as a another camera body,two depending on what model you get and is bigger than the camera.

Because some places lately seem to allow you to bring in a small non-professional camera with no tripod and the Nex-6 is small enough to probably make it in, and a monopod would probably go unquestioned as well.)Thicker strap (while the camera is relatively lightweight, the strap it comes with is pretty thin and uncomfortable after a while.)More lenses (of course!)Filter kitProbably more stuff I'm forgetting right now.Basically, the price for this camera isn't just the price for this camera, because there are probably plenty of extras you will \"need\" to get to go with it. But that's cool...I think it's worth it. Last year I was comparing some point and shoot digital cameras and they both took really good pictures, especially the 18.2 MP camera and they had a lot of features and both of them took much better pictures than my iPhone, but eventually I stopped carrying my point and shoot because it was too much of a hassle to take a picture with it and then get that picture off the camera and either onto my computer or my phone or iPad and I couldn't be bothered. This camera has renewed my enthusiasm for carrying a separate camera. First of all, after installing the appropriate app on both the camera and the iPhone I can now make a direct WiFi connection between the two and send pics to the phone any time. Second, I can also use my phone as a remote control for the camera and that's relatively easy as well, although I'm pretty spoiled now by being able to put my eye up to the viewfinder of the Nex-6, especially when outdoors in bright lighting and so that's my preferred method now.I used to use a Nikon D300 and that thing is a behemoth compared to this Nex-6, definitely not purse size. The Nex-6 fits in my purse and a book still fits in there, too!Overall, most of the apps available for this camera seem a bit silly and I don't really see paying for them (the remote control and share-to-phone apps are some of the few free ones) but I think this is a pretty awesome camera I expect to get a LOT of use out of for a long time to come, whether I learn to use ALL the bells and whistles or not.", "Date": "July 2, 2013"}, {"Title": "Great compact camera with professional options and very large sensor", "Author": "CoNE", "ReviewID": "R1P857ELLGKDAD", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "Pros:-Excellent controls and customizable buttons.-Great images and video.-Small body is comfortable to use and handle it-EVF-Sensor size and quality-Many manual lenses capable with adaptersCons:-Battery duration-Wi-Fi needs hotspot-Powered lens zoom is imprecise-16-50 is no the best lens", "Date": "March 7, 2013"}, {"Title": "Probably a little more camera than I need", "Author": "Eeyore", "ReviewID": "R1MM7EMH2G3NKY", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "I'm a complete novice and I bought this camera mainly because it was on sale and I needed a camera to photograph my jigsaw collection. So far it has been great. Something that I want to emphasize to anyone who is thinking about buying a new camera is that the NEX-6 has a viewfinder and the other lower priced cameras I looked at do not and I now realize that the viewfinder is an absolutely essential feature of a good camera.  It is literally impossible for me to take pictures in the bright sunlight without it.  The LCD monitor is only good for looking at pictures already taken and making some changes to the settings. Because of glare it really isn't useful for taking photographs in sunlight. Something I like about the NEX-6 is that the lenses are relatively inexpensive. It came with the 16-50mm Power Zoom lense and after looking at some reviews and reading what other owners have bought I spent another $240 for the Sony E 55-210mm F4.5-6.3 OSS Lens (White Box) and another $360 for the trio of 16mm f/2.8 Wide-Angle and Fisheye Conversion and High Definition Wide Angle Lenses. I really got a good deal on the 16mm f/2.8 wide-angle lense so make sure you buy these lenses when they have clearance sales. I don't know much about how the image quality compares with other cameras but it seems pretty good. The manual is not very clear but may be good enough for an experience photographer. I have bought mostly what other people have purchased as far as accessories. So far no big mistakes. The Case Logic camera case is a little small now that I have all of these extra lenses but I can get almost everything in it. I bought for $19 the Vivitar filters which seem to not make much of a difference to image quality but I'm glad they are in my kit. You'll need to buy some lense pouches for your extra lenses. I probably overpaid $30 for 3 of them.  The E 55-210mm needs a large pouch. The others only need small. In addition to the Sony 32GB SDHC Class 10 UHS-1 R40 Memory Card you will definitely need the Wasabi Power Battery (2-Pack) and wall charger. The NEX-6 has a short battery life and you'll need these spare batteries for an all-day sightseeing trip. I've spent about $1300 total on this camera which is about $1100 more than I was planning on spending originally but I found out that this is really cheap compared to what high end cameras cost. It is not a professional camera and the lenses aren't that great but they are good enough for 99% of the people out there. When I was shopping I worried that the 16.1 MP sensor wouldn't be good enough. I found out it is plenty. My jpeg pictures are about 5 MB in size and are 3000 by 4000 pixels when posted on flickr. The camera is rather small and I was worried about dropping it so I attached a wrist band and I have ordered an LCD screen cover. I'm not sure what else I would need. Unlike Canon and Nikon, the NEX doesn't have a huge selection of lenses. I believe that Sony has some new lenses coming out this year that can take advantage of the 24.3 MP sensors but the existing lenses that I bought are well suited for my 16.1 MP NEX-6.", "Date": "June 7, 2014"}, {"Title": "Love It So Far!", "Author": "RFSTech, Inc", "ReviewID": "R35N574MV0U6R7", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "Much more complicated then the old Panasonic point-and-shoot but excellent picture quality so far.

Griffin", "ReviewID": "R19M27E02MEJYS", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "when it comes to my experience in taking pictures I'm a novice at best but I can,  and do shoot in other modes other then auto. plus I have purchase a couple other lens  to use with camera other than what came with it. with that said I bought this camera to replace and upgrade from my NEX f3 that I bought a couple of years ago. I researched both the NEX 6 andthe A6000 that was going to replace it and I was set to purchase the A6000 when it came out.  but ultimately it came down to money and at the time I could buy the NEX 6 for a couple hundred dollars cheaper, plus with the A6000 not out yet their were a few things that they had changed that I wasn't sure if they were for the better or not. so here's my impression of this camera for the couple months that I have had it first the badCONS.the menu system: and this goes for all Sony NEX cameras. if you plan on taking pictures in any other mode than automatic it takes way too long to find some of the settings that I'm looking for. setup is the worst by far there are settings in this menu that should be under camera and settings under camera that would better served under settings.the control wheel:again this goes for all Sony NEX cameras and even the new A000 series that replace the one I have. it's simply a bad design, it's too easy to bump it and go into another setting that is designate for this wheel not to mention it likes to flip back to a previous item on it's own. if you are trying to navigate the menu system this task is made I little worst on the NEX 3 were the mode dial is part of that same menu system. E16 - 50mm lens:I don't like this lens  for a couple of reason for one since it's meant to be more compact in size, the zooming in and out is by wire instead of the traditional  mechanical, which means that when you turn the rotator ring there is a lag between your action and the Len's response time and its a little annoying when your trying to compose a shot just right. the power zoom lever in my opinion isn't much better. the other thing to note about this lens is the distortion at the lower end of the zoom range.Phase Detection Compatibility:I found out by accident that the Phase Detection part of the hybrid AF system on this camera is a firmware feature of the E16- 50mm lens. yes you do have ability to turn this function on or off (Setup Menu) on the camera but the Phase Detection AF is only compatible with certain Lens. you can't use it with third party lens or some prime lens. and if you bought one of the older E mount lens like I have, it becomes a compatibility  issue without a firmware upgrade to the Lens itself. I have a E55 - 210mm lens I had purchased in a bundle when I bought my NEX 3 and had to do this upgrade. note that the particular lens that you want to updated has to be connected to the camera while doing so. as of this writing firmware updates are only available for the E18 -55mm, E55 - 210mm, E18 - 200mm, and the Sonar TE 24mm lens. check the Sony site for updates.Eye Sensor (for EVF):on bright days if your hand passes over this sensor as you are adjusting the LCD screens angle it will confuse the camera into thinking that you are using the  EVF and briefly turn of the LCD screen off. that being said its still a nice thing to have.PROS.EVF(electronic viewfinder):this is one of the main reason why I wanted to purchase this camera. their are some situations were the LCD screen just wont work, like a bright sunny day or on a winters day when everything is covered in snow, it helps to have this feature. best part is that 100% of what you see is exactly what your shot will be so composition is a no brainer. the downside of this is that even at over 2,000,000+ dots the picture is still noisy with colors tending to be a little over saturated. and on cloudy days it's hard to pick out details, however the brightness of this viewfinder can be adjusted to compensate for this. just keep in mind that the EVF actually uses more battery power.Build Quality:taking this camera out of the box first thing I notice is how this felt better in my hand than the NEX 3. I know they're pretty much the same camera but this one feels a little more like it was honed from one piece of metal even though the housing is basically plastic. it still has weight to it, not too much though. I love the feel of the grip in my hand. I'd rather walk around with the camera in hand like this than around my neck, that's why I bought a Joby wrist strap for it. the mode dial requires a little more of a cokes to turn it than the control dial below it. this will ensure that it wont be accidently moved while it's in your bag or if it gets bumped up against something.Mode Dial:if you've had a NEX 3 or 5  this speaks for itself.Control Dial:this is a great addition and alternative to the control wheel that the NEX series uses to navigate Aperture or Shutter Priority. it's also better to use this to navigate the menu system than that bloody wheel. Fn (function button) + other customizable buttons:think of this as a mini  menu for your most used settings. you can program up to six different items.Dedicated ISO & EV Buttons:even though there located on the control wheel I love so much. at least there easy to get to. just access the menu and do the adjustment that I want.Adjustable LCD Screen:you can adjust it 90 Degrees up and 45 degrees down. no you cant do selfy's with it like some of the cameras in the NEX/A000 line up  but this isn't something I personally care about. although side to side adjustability would have been welcomed.Battery Life:in my personal use with this camera in low light conditions were it requires me to have this thing on for awhile, or times that I have to use the EVF,  or even when I'm using the Wi-Fi connection so I can use my smart phone as a wireless remote I would have to save that battery life is pretty descent. it's still good to invest in a extra Sony made battery though.Wi-Fi:the main reason I like this feature is that like I said up above I can use my smart phone(in my case a lowly s4) as a wireless remote. for instance when the sun is lower in the sky or at an angle that reduces my ability to see what I have composed in my shot I can walk into a shaded area away from my camera to see if I have the camera positioned right. or the sun is low and I'm trying to capture the shadows of the late day, on a tripod but I find that my shadow might be in the shot as well, I can walk a few feet away until I'm out of the shot and still see how it looks. or my tripod is positioned all the way to the ground looking up at some trees or whatever, and I don't want to lay on the ground to compose the shot. I just position the camera using my phone's screen to make sure I have the shot the way I want. contrary to what I have read of some of reviews on this site or YouTube videos about this feature,(Smart Remote Control) if you are using it in say Aperture mode or even complete manual mode like I have done you DOhave control of the camera settings on you phone. you just have to make sure you have downloaded the latest version of the Smart Remote Control from Sony's app store.bottom line this a really good camera to grow into (get out of auto mode and experiment) and it's even better if you take the time to learn what your camera can do. if your  on a budget like I am but want to be able take descent pictures better say than what a point & shoot can do (they can't compete with a APSC Sensor)  I would say you cant go wrong. however if you can afford to spend the extra money get the Sony A6000 than do so. the new menu system on the A6000 worth the upgrade alone...", "Date": "May 17, 2014"}, {"Title": "Good quality", "Author": "Tracy Jameson", "ReviewID": "R23QNDQEUM1PBK", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "I was pleased to find out that the quality of the Sony cameras has not changed.

(2) the built in flash so instead of the flimsy screw on attachable flash (a decent fill in flash), (3) built in charger (I bought a tiny USB cable so I can charge from my laptop or a car usb/cigarette lighter), (4) mode dial, (5) on screen level. In theory the wifi is useful, but probably due to Apple's restrictions this is a bit clumsy with an iPhone (you have to go to the settings to connect to the camera rather than this happening automatically when you start the iPhone application). In theory the combined phase and contrast auto focus is better - in general I find both camera's fine in good light and they both hunt a bit in dim situations. The compact kit zoom is very small, but I typically shoot with the very nice 50f18 prime lens. The standard flash hot shoe is nice, but I tend to use a constant LED panel when I need additional light. So in general I think this is a very solid upgrade for owners of the NEX 3 and 5 models (though I miss the touch screen of the 5N). I have to say I really like the electronic view finder - it helps check white balance and I actually prefer this to an optical view finder. I rate this as 4 stars as while it is a good product I do think people who are not invested in the NEX system should at least consider the options from Fuji (XE2) and Olympus (EM5) - those camera bodies are pricier, but they have a better range of lenses at reasonable prices.

Also, the addition of a control dial allowing on the fly mode changes, with an additional dial below allowing for manual adjustments, was a crucial change for the better. Finally, the bulkier grip with a bit more of a rubberized feel, is just so much more comfortable to hold than the 5N's plastic casing. This camera is well worth the extra cost for the features that make it a true DSLR replacement option.Note: While the 6 loses the touch screen that the 5N (and now 5T) has, it's no big loss.

I am not a stranger to Sony cameras as I have plenty of them.  I just sold a Nex F3 to get this Nex 6.  I really like the Nex 6 camera and have some really good tips and ideas and observations concerning the camera.  All the specifications have already been gone through in other reviews.  This one is about certain parts of the camera and how to use them, and different accessories that work really well with the Nex 6.  This review is somewhat long with all the tips and hints I refer to, so the review is continued in the first comment following the review.1.  If Clear Image Zoom is turned on and you are using the Sony 16-50mm Lens, Clear Image Zoom takes place on the meter zoom bar in the LCD at the half way point in the meter. Anything more than the partition is in the middle is Clear Image Zoom.  I like setting Zoom as the Soft Key B in Custom Key Settings.  That way when you are taking photos and want more zoom (Clear Image) it is there for quick use.  It is the key at the bottom right of the LCD.  If the camera is set up to  Flexible Spot Focus, the Soft Key B is taken over by Flexible Focus and will not work for anything else.  I don't like Flexible Spot Focus, because by the time you move the focus box to the point on your screen you want, the target has proably left the area.  I selected Center Focus as the focus point and that way it works fine.  Just focus what you want sharp in the center of the frame, half press the shutter to hold focus and reframe the shot the way you want it.  To get to the Custom Key Settings go to the Setup Menu and it is about half  way down.  Only two keys are selectable, the AEL Key Setting and the Soft Key B Setting.  There are many selections in this area, but I like the Zoom setting as there is no easy way to zoom the camera without a key or you have to go to the Menu to select it and that takes too long.  The shot would be gone by the time you got to the Zoom Meter.2.  Fn Menu set and use.  The Fn Menu is activated by pressing the Fn button on the right side of the shutter.  Once this button is pushed the #1 item will be shown on the right side and the rest are at the bottom of the LCD.  You can scroll from left to right with the 4 way controller.  To set up the Fn Menu, go to Menu, Setup, and it is about half way down under Function Menu Settings.  There are 6 custom settings and each one is programmable.3.  The camera has a Bulb Mode in Manual.  Just go to Manual on the top dial, then rotate the dial on the 4 way switch to the left and the shutter speed will decrease.  Once you reach 30 seconds, go one more and that is the Bulb Mode.  The camera shutter will stay open as long as you hold the shutter down in this mode.  I just took a photo yesterday with the ISO at 100 and in the dark outside my house and the shutter was open for 192 seconds.  The shot turned out really great and the photo showed way more than my eyes could see.  You have two options in using this mode.  One is to hold the Shutter Button down as long as you want the exposure to be, or two, use an Infrared Shutter Release.  They are cheap on Amazon.  The Sony one is much more expensive and does the same as the aftermarket ones do.  Here is one that I bought and it works fine. B003MQWN40Since this review is so long, the rest is in Comments 1.

This was to replace my faithful and beloved Lumix GF1 with the wonderful 20mm1.7 lens. The NEX6 takes time to get used to. The menu I thought it was a pain until getting used to and now I find it very handy by using the summary mode in LCD exclusively. As far as the image goes, I will be very upset if they dont release better, faster lenses soon. I feel the body/sensor/features is there but not the lenses.. the kit lens is good if the lighting and conditions are good, otherwise i know to keep the 35mm1.8 on, which is not spectacular but a good lens.Not to repeat the same things but 2 things I found it worth mentioning: 1)I actually liked the flash i can manual bounce that works pretty well if ceiling allows. 2)If you set light mettering as the overall weighted, then you get 90% of times underexposed. This was bothering me so much, and even saw the same complain in dpreview. But figured out setting to center weighted and I get similar brighter result to my GF1.Overall, satisfied upgrade from GF1. Definitely sensor size difference is seen. Was hoping it was more pronounced. I think it is the lack of lenses that does not maximize it. The Zeiss lens is too expensive and I feel is not much better than the lumix 20f1.7  Had I known the results, I would have waited longer for the next NEX or XE-2.", "Date": "April 16, 2013"}, {"Title": "I love my NEX6!", "Author": "Gina B. \"It's a dry heat!\"", "ReviewID": "R94OS7WXFWJOE", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I've had a lot of cameras over the years, but I have loved none more than my NEX6.

I would recommend this camera to beginners who like to shoot on full auto or to more advanced users who need plenty of settings to tweak.

I'm a small woman and the NEX-6's size is perfect for me. Love the grip. Feels great in my hands. Having used Sony cameras, the menus are not difficult for me. When my Sony DSC-F717 (5mp) died a few years ago, I was lazy and relied on my iPhone or Sony HDR-SR12 Handycam for photos. So I was blown away by the picture quality of the NEX-6, especially in low light. In my first month, I've only shot in the 2 automatic modes, with excellent results. I'm looking forward to learning how to shoot in the manual modes.The only CON for me, as an avid vacation videographer, is that I can't replace my video camera with the NEX-6. The 1080p picture is great, but it's much too slow compared to a hard drive camcorder, even with an SDXC card. Also it lacks the pause function that allows you to shoot short clips quickly. And no Dolby Digital 5.1, just subpar stereo.

Having always used a point-and-shoot before, but wanting to get into photography as a hobby and personal project, I found this camera to be the happy medium I was looking for to make the jump up.It's of course much smaller and lighter than my friends DSLRs, yet packs the same APS-C size sensor in it. This is exactly what I wanted as I plan to keep the camera in my bag for quick access to it. Something the other cameras would be troublesome with.I've had my eyes on getting a Sony Nex for over a year now, and after comparing the Nex 7, and the newly released Nex 6 and Nex 5R, I choose the Nex 6 because it had features over the Nex 5R I wanted (built in EVF, 16-50mm pancake lens instead of 18-55mm, better button control for manual use, and internal flash), and tests show the Nex 5/6 actually take better quality pictures than the Nex 7's 24MP sensor because the higher MP count pushes the sensor too far. So until Sony releases the next version of the 7 in 2013, the Nex 6 has been updated to be better in almost every way (an example is the video record button, on the Nex 7, it's easy to accidentally hit it with your thumb, causing recordings at random times. The Nex 6 fixes this button placement). This, combined with the 7 being more expensive, made the choice a no brainer for me.The draw back is the Nex 6 doesn't have a touch screen like the 5R and the screen can't be flipped 180 degrees for taking self portraits (not a deal breaker for me). It's also has a slightly larger and heavier body than the 5R, but I view this as a plus because I have big hands and the 5R gip is a bit small for me (plus I think the 5R body is unbalanced with big lens on it). The Nex 6 also doesn't have a microphone jack plug like the 7. But DSLR and these newer generation mirrorless cameras generally have poor internal audio anyway, so I've bought an inexpensive lav mic (Audio-Technica ATR-3350) and plug conductor (Kv Connection KM-IPHONE-MIC) to record audio on my iPhone using the iTalk app (which surprisingly takes good audio. Not quite as good as spending several hundred on a dedicated audio recorder like the Zoom H4n, but I already have the iPhone, and would rather use the extra money to buy a nicer prime lens). The audio can then be sync easily into the videos in post using a choice of different software programs (from basic stock programs that come with most computers, to expensive professional software). I'll be using Adobe Premier Pro CS6. This external audio workflow was recommended to me by the pros.After a few hours of playing around with the Nex 6 and it's settings, I've was able learn the basics of how aperture, shutter speed, and ISO all play together. I didn't even fully understand what aperture was 2 days ago when I received the Nex. In fact, when I took my first few shots out of the box, using it like a point-and-shoot, the image quality was below par. My iPhone took better pictures when I quickly compared them. I was starting to doubt it was a good purchase. But then I started playing with the Nex and adjusting the settings and the iPhone became a toy in comparison. The images and videos are just beautiful. And that's with the 16-50mm kit lens (I haven't purchase a dedicated prime lens yet as I'm still learning more about them before I make that investment). The controls and buttons are easy to learn and the camera is quite simple to use. Great for prosumers like me looking to create great pictures and videos using both auto and manual control without being overloaded with 1000 different adjustments.The only annoyance I have with the Nex 6 at the moment, is the focus in the non-smartauto settings often flicker in and out rapidly (but are focused when the shot is taken).

And, for the most part, I found that I liked it too - hence my 4 star rating.Here's why:++ APS-C size sensor.++ 16MP means larger cells with great low light performance. And, smaller files to archive.++ Light, compact, and barely noticeable even after a full day on the go.++ Electronic View Finder is an improvement over a shoot-and-review optical view finder.++ 16-50mm kit lens with its tiny size, low weight, and Optical Steady Shot, is squarely in walkabout country.++ Built in flash is handy - but don't expect miracles (GN=6m)++ New universal shoe for recent flashes++ Usual Sony must-haves like panorama and multi frame noise reduction++ Decent number of hard button and control wheels++ Standard micro-USB for charging from computers and battery packs++ Built in Wi-Fi++ Articulated rear LCD panelHowever, here's why it stopped just short of a 5-star camera for me. Many of the following may not matter to you, but they did end up impacting my overall experience.1. Usability/Ergonomics.-- Movie Rec button is located under my main gripping hand so I need to shift hands to press it.-- You can edit shooting settings on the rear LCD using the Fn key in \"For Viewfinder\" mode. However, if you accept a change by pressing the Menu or Enter buttons, or half pressing the shutter, you are taken out of edit mode and must press Fn again to make another change. To remain in edit mode, you must press Fn instead. This is annoying since the Fn button is really hard to hit when staring at the rear LCD.-- The mechanical flash release button needs way too much pressure to activate.-- The flat recessing of the hard buttons makes it impossible to touch-sense the buttons.-- The far-left positioning of the view finder is simply awkward.-- The kit lens' tiny zoom ring and lever make it fiddly and imprecise to operate by touch.-- Only two of the hard buttons can be reassigned, and the back thumb-wheel is useless in PAS modes.-- The lack of an independent charger means that the camera is busy when charging, and it is also harder to charge multiple batteries.-- Oddly the camera won't charge unless its power switch is in the OFF position.2. Menuing system is abysmal-- Item placement in categories seems capricious. E.g., Flash mode is in the Camera menu, but Flash compensation is in the Brightness menu.-- Commonly used controls are dispersed across menus. E.g., AF mode, AF area, and AF/MF selection are in the Camera menu, but exposure comp, flash comp, WB, and ISO are in the Brightness menu.-- Some menus are simply too long - e.g., the Setup menu has almost 70 settings that you have to scroll through.-- The camera imagines you only want to change one item at a time. E.g., selecting the AF Area and OK'ing a change, will simply drop you out of the menu, requiring you to re-enter the menu-ing system. Annoying.3. Auto ISO-- not possible to set a max ISO ceiling-- Pick Auto ISO in PAS mode, then change to M mode and pick a different ISO. On returning to PAS, you will find that the camera forgets that you wanted Auto ISO. This is unfortunate.-- In M mode, cannot set ISO to Auto (a really convenient feature on the A99 - where exposure comp changes ISO)Added June 01, 2013:4. Annoying focus hunting in AF-C mode-- Even in ideal lighting conditions (clear sky, mid morning and early evening) for landscape shooting, the image in the viewfinder will pulse furiously - even after the green focus indicator shows that focus lock has been obtained. This was so unnerving that I thought something was wrong with the camera. The only options? Switch to AF-S for still shooting; or just ignore the pulsing, as the AF-C captured images are fine. (See first comment for a link to what this looks like.)Conclusion#######This is not a perfect camera - but it definitely comes close. Fortunately, none of the issues that bothered me actually affect image quality; and many of them can be mitigated by camera configuration or acquiring new muscle memory. Others can simply be ignored - e.g., I do not expect to use the movie rec button often.Overall, with the NEX-6, you get DSLR level control, and awesome images that are sharp, with good color saturation, and low noise even at high ISOs (through 3200). And, I'm still amazed at how much functionality has been crammed into this tiny package.The NEX-6 is just the ticket for when I need to travel light, but don't want to give up advanced camera controls.Happy Photography!", "Date": "May 29, 2013"}, {"Title": "Excellent", "Author": "vj", "ReviewID": "RS9MY5ZWGHBYM", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "Excellent replacement for a bulk DSLR, this one on par with a pro nikon dslr used by a pro shooter.

So now I have something really easy to carry, that cost about one third what the Canon set me back. This makes my back and my wallet hurt a bit less. The photos are really pretty good, not quite the resolution of the Nex7, (or the 5d2 natch), but the noise is lessened at higher ISOs compared to the Nex7 at least. The kit lens is ok for what it is, not to be compared with some of its more expensive competitors like the Fuji Xe1, but then again that camera costs half again as much as the Sony, and doesn't handle nearly as effortlessly. I bought the Sigma 30 2.8 and it seems to be considerably sharper, but for this kind of cam, easy zooming is what I'm probably going to be doing the most of.The downfall of this cam for me is the fact that I'm a Mac user, and all that Sony Wifi software really isn't all that great, at least on the Mac's OSX. (I think that it's better on the iphone's IOS, but I don't have an iphone). There's really only one program to wirelessly upload to my MacPro, and that is shaky at best, and is designed to actually shut the camera down after the image(s) are sent to the computer- like I'm not going to want to shoot any more pictures after the one I just looked at on screen. What? How could they be that out in left field? Well, it is what it is until the software is upgraded.Another bad choice is the micro usb connection that's supposed to do double duty of connecting the camera to your computer, and the battery charging adapter. Really?- a flimsy little micro mini that feels like its going to last about 3 months- why not the regular mini usb plug that every other camera I've ever owned has had? Well I guess the assumption is that you're going to sending all your photos to your iphone, or facebook, or whatever, but come on, there's got to be plenty of older people like me who never bother with that kind of stuff who just want to see the pics on a computer screen. Well, I guess this implementation will be improved over time, but for right now the Wifi hoohah is really not so great, especially without a touch screen. Logging in is torture if you've got any more than 3 letters in your email address.My last gripe has to do with battery life and charging. At least have a spare battery and an external charger. Sony's omitting a real battery charger is unconscionable with the way this camera eats batteries. I haven't been able to get through a day of just fooling around shooting without the battery going dead - so if you have a spare, at least you finish the day - but without the charger, your camera is locked up for 3-4 hours when you need to charge the dead one.Any way, having said all that, there is still plenty to like about this camera - I'm just wondering if I'd have been better served by the 7, even without the (not very useful to me) WiFi stuff.", "Date": "July 19, 2013"}, {"Title": "DSLR quality images in a compact body...", "Author": "deck2c", "ReviewID": "R20804EA59AR78", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "I owned a D600 & a D7000 body and i must say, quality for me is very important. But carrying all the weight of my camera equipment sometimes can be very annoying. So I decided to look at some of the micro four-thirds cameras in the market. I asked a professional photographer friend of mine and gave me some suggestions. He gave me two options. The Olympus OMD which he owned and the Sony NEX-6. So I did my research and comparing the two, the OMD really stands out. But I decided to settle with the NEX-6 just because of the price difference. And boy was I surprised!!! When I saw the pictures coming out of this small camera I was really happy about it. Having an APS-C sensor in a compact body is very convenient. I know Sony makes sensors for Nikon and the sensor on this camera is the same as the D7000 so its like carrying my D7000 with me without the heavy weight of the camera. I just need to invest on some good glass for maximum image quality. But the kit lens already looks nice and sharp. And the 10fps is great especially for moving subjects like kids. The only reason I'm giving this a 4 star is because there is no mic input unlike the NEX-7. I have and external audio recorder but i'd rather have that option of a mic input in case i need to. But the video quality in this camera is great as well. Low light images is superb. I can shoot up to ISO 3200 and still get good quality images. I do post processing anyway but having to shoot at that high ISO makes my editing less. And the dynamic range also is very good.

Very happy with the NEX brand, this is a significant upgrade from the C3, love the external controls, very solid feel, fast and great pictures. I love the built in flash because you can use it direct or hold it facing upwards to make it act like a bounce flash which is great if you don't have your external flash handy. It does have a ISO hotshoe flash but I recommend buying the Sony branded flash for better fill light and bounce flash as the standard flashes are never great.Couple things i don't like is that it's too new so programs like Aperture for OSX took a while to support RAW (Sony's ARW) format. They do now but still don't have the lense profiles for the new compact lens it comes with. Although i love the lens (for a kit lens it's not bad) but it does barrel a bit without the lens profile so expect to do some Lightroom or Aperture editing to fix it until Apple or Adobe adds those profiles.Great value for money and VERY portable.

As a serious enthusiast who's very picky about IQ, mirrorless cameras never really appealed to me besides portability; that of course changed after a quick exposure to the Sony NEX 5N from a friend.  The quality left me baffled as I pondered over the similarity to my trusted Nikon D7000; I have underestimated those tiny cameras for the longest, thinking it'd be a downgrade.Ordered the 5R but lack of EVF prompted me to sell it and acquire the NEX 6 which is even better with all the external dials (less menu diving) and better built.  The IQ is on par with my Nikon D7000 with good IQ up to ISO 3200.  The autofocus continuous is not as fast as the Nikon but knowing the limitations allow me to use the camera as its strengths.The obvious thing to do was to move up from the D7k to the D600; having two APS-C sensors with similar IQ became redundant.Get the Sigma 30mm f2.8 for a good match up, don't trust sony NEX lenses!

(i also have multiple Nikon DSLRs and never had to open and clean the sensor by hand.)adding to my negative experience is the lousy customer support.  somehow their system online doesn't remember my purchase no matter how many times i register it.  and at one point i was blocked out of my online \"Play Memories\" account and have not gotten a favorable response from customer service, either on line or over the phone.it is sad to see Sony go downhill since  i associate them with good hardware builds but that is what is occurring.  i feel they are so big and distracted by all their other problems (ie.

But the end results are generally good. I also had many point'n'shoot cameras with the last one being Sony HX-5. It was very smart, and would take two shots when it wasn't sure (silhouette on white background, for example). So this NEX-6 embodies hybrid of two. It's point'n'shoot with some DSLR qualities. Only downside is autofocus speed in bad light. It can be slow and hunting.General still image quality out of camera is pretty good. It's \"sweet 16\" sensor. I shoot RAW to resolve any exposure or white balance issues in Post-Processing. 10fps continuous shooting is pretty amazing. I also use this camera as my video camcorder. And it is pretty good in low light like in dance studio. The ability to set certain parameters for video like White balance and exposure compensation is very promising - in fluorescent or tungsten light I get better video. I use optically stabilized lens for my video.Built-in flash is too low for some bigger lenses so I'm planning to get some external small flash gun. Built-in flash can be bent to point to the ceiling (if there is a ceiling) to achieve soft shadows.Menu system is split into big (hard to scroll thru) and illogical groups, so it takes time to learn it.

Good thing I bought this Sony it is just amazingly  fast, convenient, light, lots of very good features perfect camera for traveling. I can compare it to nikon dslr it is up to or better performance in low light.Video option you can't even compare to nikon dslr due to the constant noise from auto focusing motor that make video simply unusable I did tried it on D800  it is simply bad unless you would buy Very expensive external mic. Sony has a very great feature as HDR painting mode it just great it works in A S P M modes you can create a really stunning pictures in that mode without tripod,extra software or very cumbersome bracketing mode. This mode especially works well for landscape, stationary objects in interesting lightning conditions. Anyway the camera is simply amazing I do not see any particular reason why would somebody buy heavy and I convinient dslr. Of course nikon keep doing it marketing moves like 36 mega pixels full frame magnesium body and other remotely related to joy and quality photography items. Thre are two reasons of my review first let people know how good and convinient sony product and second is  not people do the same mistake as I did buying a very expensive full frame nikon dslr.

Sony Nex products in my opinion is a future of photography fast light full of feature.

I myself preordered it 5 min after it was announced. But once you use it for a while you'll discover that there are important ways in which it is intentionally crippled by Sony. I guess they really want to leave some crucial features for their higher end offerings and future upgrades.The primary issue is the behavior of AutoISO in A/S/P modes and its absence in M mode. First I consider AutoISO as essential as auto focus. There are no reasons why a user should touch ISO 99% of the time (if exposure is not right there is always compensation). Especially if there is no dedicated button for it.The problem with AutoISO on this camera is that when you use the camera in something other than broad daylight (say at home or in shade or any time more than ISO 100 is necessary) the camera becomes very inflexible. In A/P modes, it always defaults to 1/60sec shutter (or slightly faster for long focal lengths). This is suitable for some uses but not suitable for most. Most importantly if you ever plan to take pictures of children indoors or in shade you cannot use these modes with AutoISO.  This is also not ideal for still objects which can easily be photographed at 1/15-1/30sec which would allow using lower ISO.You can switch to S mode and choose your shutter speed, but then with AutoISO the aperture will default to F4 (up through ISO 3200). This is again very undesirable for many scenarios. Especially, if you have one of the fast NEX F1.8 lenses you'll only be able to use them at best at F4. This \"wastes\" more than 2 stops of lights defeating one of main purposes of fast lenses. I have two such lenses so it's a real pain.Finally, there is M mode in which you can set both aperture and shutter. But here is a great surprise: the AutoISO no longer works. So you have to adjust it every time the light changes a bit. And there is no easy way to do that when you are looking through a viewfinder. So instead of taking pictures you end up tweaking settings and missing important moments (or getting badly exposed photos). Modern camera without AutoISO in M mode is simply unacceptable ... (in the same way as would be not having Auto focus in M mode)I should note that this is not a new problem. All NEX cameras are crippled in this way. But what was OK a couple of years on $500-600 camera makes no sense on a recent camera costing $850. No Canon or Nikon camera has such issues (even Sony own A99 and RX1 have AutoISO in M mode).There some other minor disappointments. Neither is a deal-breaker for me but they make an upgrade from NEX 5n less enticing.1. No touch screen. That's not a big deal for photos but is awesome for tracking in video. I used it all the time on my NEX 5n. It's really annoying that this camera lacks it.2. The better hybrid AF is not used for video. So in video with fast lenses you still get horrible hunting and slow focusing. To me this would have been the main advantage of hybrid AF. Instead it's a disappointment.3. New hybrid AF is not compatible with Sony NEX 50mm F1.8 (which I own) and 35mm F1.8(which I plan to buy). These are the lenses that really need it. Somehow Sony does not support them and gives no clear information when they will be supported (aside from some vague promise that eventually they will).All in all NEX-6 is a half-baked product. Some great technology and features but without the usability it's not worth it. I know most people upgrading from point-and-shoot cameras just don't realize what is missing since they rarely use anything beyond \"intelligent\" Auto mode (and just blame themselves when pictures do not come out, which is guaranteed to happen often). Also people who mostly care about daylight photography and controlled conditions (as most review sites do) will likely not care about these basic features and keep piling rave reviews. But for anyone who cares about taking their photography to the next level is likely to be frustrated with this camera.Going back to the title of my review this camera is like a convertible that does not convert.In a sunny and warm weather this car is simply perfect. But when it rains or is cold you'll hate it. In the same way when you'll go beyond the basic uses you'll realize the limitations and wish Sony engineers have invested some more thought in a $1000 product.", "Date": "November 14, 2012"}, {"Title": "Nex 6 review", "Author": "Ronald Perry", "ReviewID": "R1RSUZYEMH0GV4", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "Read all the the reviews on the net.

It was quite fun to use for three days (until I returned it).So why did I return it. It's actually quite good camera but does not improve enough over a much cheaper NEX 5n to be worth it for me (and in some ways, like absence of touch screen, it's worse).The user interface is still too much point-and-shoot oriented and restricted and at the same time badly organized and confusing.One example which is already mentioned in a couple of reviews is the lack of AutoISO in manual. So you'll end up tweaking ISO a lot manually. Funnily, even though it has two wheels you cannot assign either of them to control ISO in S/A/P modes. So one wheel is essentially useless most of the time.The interface itself is seriously illogical: the division of features into Camera and Setup sub-menus is quite random (guess which one has \"Object tracking\" and which one \"Face priority tracking\").Movie and pics cannot be viewed/deleted together (you need to dive into the menus to switch).I also find it unfortunate that on this relatively serious camera there is no custom mode presets (in the menu or ideally on the mode dial). Instead it has two so-called \"intelligent\" modes which I reserve for giving the camera for my technologically-challenged parents to use.Finally, I had hopes that AF would be less flaky than on 5n. When taking pictures of people (even in single-point AF) it still misses quite a lot of shots and is hard to rely on.Some of these problems are quite easy to fix via a firmware, so I might still upgrade later.

As of now I am split 50/50 on keeping or returning it.Background: My main camera is Pentax K-5 with 16MP Sony APS-C sensor (also used in Nikon D7000) that was considered best in class before the latest 24-36MP offerings. Before K-5 I used 12MP K-x and 10MP K2000. A year ago, while looking for more portable alternatives with decent image quality, I stumbled upon Panasonic G1 with 14-45mm kit lens (considered the best kit lens) and was immediately sold on the micro 4/3 system.  Even though the m4/3 sensor is inherently smaller than APS-C, the G1 is 2 generations behind the current G5 and the focusing speed isn't that great, the handling of the camera (non-slip rubbery coating all over, protruding battery grip, excellent controls and ergonomics, fully articulated flip screen) compensates for its shortcomings and make its use a real pleasure. This is also one of few cameras there iA mode really works (see below) unless you are trying to shoot backlit birds in flight while riding a rollercoaster. Later on I added more pocketable Panasonic G3 with better sensor / AF speed, touchscreen and video recording that left me with mixed feelings - what it gained in updated electronics, it lost in handling. The body is too small, slippery and at least 2 physical buttons short compared to the G1. As a result, when I use the G1 the first question in my head is \"Can I get this shot knowing its limitations?\", while with the G3 \"Where should I grab it to get the shot?\". I am also using PS Panasonic ZS7 with pretty sharp Leica zoom as a \"pocket notebook\" in PASM (unlike the G1 its iA and iA+ are just horrendous), so ZS7 IQ is the lowest end on my scale. I am on the fence with Olympus OM-D - it's IQ, focusing speed and customization beats many DSLRs but the body is on a smallish side and rather \"dense\" that makes its handling similar to the G3. Recently a reasonably priced 3rd party screw-on plastic grip has been release that should improve on handling.Based on the above, my expectations for the NEX-6 were a compact but not too small size with comfortable handling, use in bright sun - OVF, tiltable screen (not fully articulated but better than fixed), IQ between K-5 and K-x/G1/G3, not the fastest in the industry but fast for my purposes AF, compact lens (willing to compromise a bit at the expense of IQ) and focus peaking for manual high quality lenses (with adapter). Here is what I've gotten so far:Build/Handling Pros: The size is just right - not too small, not too big. Great handgrip enhanced with a textured rubber coating stretching to the back where it's contoured. The rest of the body is not rubberized but slightly textured that makes it more grippy, less shiny /conspicuous and doesn't show fingerprints smudges. The collapsed pancake zoom slightly protrudes beyond the grip with very nice weight distribution. Easy to hold and point with one hand, even better if you cradle the lens/body bottom with the other. The placement of slightly recessed textured Movie button on diagonally sliced off top right back corner is ingenious. Out of the way but easily reachable with positive tactile feedback - can't miss it in total darkness! All dials well textured with just right resistance and clicks. VIEWFINDER- VIEWFINDER- VIEWFINDER!!! LCD is good but you can't read it in bright sun, tilting helps but not that much. Bright, decent resolution, less \"oily\" look than previous generation, clear fonts that I was able to read clearly w/o glasses (the larger LCD with font set to large could read about 80%). Histogram in the EVF, changing PASM modes and parameters within them with the dial w/o taking your eye off it is a PLEASURABLE experience (and fast). DMF mode for zooming-auto-manual focus with the lens zoom ring (+good tactile feedback with a minute lag). Shows battery charge in %. All the above is simply delightful photographic experience!Cons: -1*.  SD card in the battery compartment is place very close and parallel to the hinges of the door (m.b. 1-2mm apart), very difficult to remove. The card/camera will be eventually broken/damaged /jammed. Absolutely idiotic engineering for $1000 camera. Even if I solve the rest of problems, most likely I will return the camera just for that. Do you want to loose 64/128GB of data and/or the camera in the most inappropriate moment?Unpleasant but I can live with: USB 2.0 - slow file transfer, SD cards are getting bigger and faster, why on earth not USB 3.0? Battery charging in camera - for 280min ~5h you can't use the camera. Not even browse pics/menu while on charger - it charges in OFF position. External charger with 2 spare batteries goes for ~$30 on Amazon but at least a basic Sony charger should have been included for the price. Menus are not bad but long untabbed - there is a scroll bar on the right showing how far you are from the beginning-end, no use for left-right buttons of the multi-dial as in most other cameras. Someone here complained that the menus are broken into multiple subdivisions (Camera-Settings-Color etc) and it makes difficult to remember where to find what you need. This is true bit it also makes these subdivisions shorter and easier to scroll, otherwise we would have to deal with menus similar to the Fuji X10 that are 5-6 pages deep w/o any indication on what page you currently are. Also, for the camera of such caliber the list of offered of menu options is a bit short. Of the present options you can put the histogram on LCD only in one set of limited number of other parameters shown. Why can't I put it with any of available sets? Makes no sense. The battery life is on a shorter side. To prolong it one can set LCD to Viewfinder only - use it to show parameters only and have live view /histogram in the EVF.JPEG image quality. I expected IQ between that of K-5 and G1/G3. For some reason it is consistently below G1 with very sharp Panasonic 14-45mm or 20mm f1.7 lenses (to be fair Panasonic uses in cameras lens correction by default), not to mention that of K-5. To test the system I turned OFF all lens correction in the menu and switched from the hybrid to normal AF. About 100 test shots were done under day light with shutter speed 1/1250-1/2000 with IS ON (that shouldn't matter at such short shutter speeds, noise reduction set to stnd first, low later. There is no option to disable the NR). I have an impression that the camera slightly front focusing. Handheld shots with very sharp stopped down to 5.6 SMC Pentax 50mm f1.7 in manual mode with focus peaking were not as sharp as expected for rather advanced Sony sensor. To eliminate potential problems with IS, I`ll redo MF shots on a tripod with IS OFF and the same with the kit pancake with and w/o in camera lens correction. At the same time, all my shots show a clear decrease in sharpness and increase in details smearing (\"watercolor\" effect) with increase in ISO. ISO 100 shots are passable, higher than that it depends with quick deterioration at ISO 400-800. From this camera I expected clean out of camera JPEGs at ISO 1600. I might have gotten a defective camera but these are image processing artifacts. Could not try RAW yet w/o updating LR to 4.3. -1* for jpeg processing. iA and iA+ in my copy of the NEX-6 are below par, for the sake of others hope it's a fluke. Just a fair warning - don't expect stellar pics out of the box.The uploaded pic shows better dynamic range (understandably) of the APS-C sensor vs. smaller micro3/4 but the resolution (as out of the camera JPEG) is not even close to 2yr old G1 with very sharp kit 14-45mm or pancake 20/1.7. Those from G1/G3 would show every single coat hair and her extremely long and thin eyelashes almost \"sticking out\" of the pic at 100% zoom. Once again, I am reviewing MY SINGLE COPY of the NEX-6/pancake zoom combo, that may be defective. The handling is exceptional (looks like other people have no problems with the SD card port), JPEG quality at the base ISO100 no better than micro4/3 and visibly degrades with ISO increase, the hybrid AF is adequate but not on par with that of Nikon 1. Feels like a \"beta\" version released before the Holiday shopping season. I applaud Sony's innovations put in one small package and hope that with the firmware updates it will be worth the price.P.S. This is my first Sony camera, would appreciate feedback from people with NEX-5n NEX-7 experience.P.P.S.

I'm a very amateur photog, but hope to be pro or at least semi-pro some day.  So far, my dealing w/ this camera have me flustered.  I have yet to really get into the photo specific controls and features, but again, from everything I've read, this has some quality specs.  Where it's lacking for me is on the software side.One of the shooting features I wanted to use almost right away was the time lapse.  I found that was a separate $10 download from the Sony store.  That seemed like something that should be a standard feature on a camera of this class, but I got past that and was ready to plunk down the money for this feature/functionality that I really wanted.  On multiple attempts from several different computers and browsers I have been stumped trying to get this to work.  Each time it says some part of my OS or browser is incompatible or just never begins any sort of install process.  I've tried from both a Win 7 32 bit and 64 bit computer w/ Firefox, Chrome and IE.  I've also tried the using the built-in wifi on the camera through my home network.  Something is just not jiving w/ my NEX-6 and the Sony Playmemories app site and there is little I can find for support.The second software related issue I have is w/ the video file format.  AVCHD .mts files will not play through Quicktime, which is the specific codec pack used by an image stabilization program I use.  That program, vReveal may be the real problem, but it seems the video file format Sony uses should be a little more compatible.Again, I have barely got into the real photography part of this camera, but I had some very specific use cases in mind for it, i.e remote controlled aerial photography, and this camera is not coming through.", "Date": "May 2, 2013"}, {"Title": "hmmm..

The transferring actually took about 5 mins or so, but I just kept it plugged in thinking that it would charge the battery.After playing with it a little, I found that the battery will get charged only when the camera is \"OFF\"!!I don't think it will be a huge issue if you are only transferring small # of pictures at a time, but if you are transferring large number of pictures taking a long time you will find yourself charging the battery all over again..I did not find any firmware update, yet.Did anyone else notice this issue? If so, hopefully, Sony will address it it theirfirmware update, otherwise, it's just my unit that is a defect. Regardless, it's a return for me.Also, another minor issue.

When Sony announced this they had more to showcase but they are not yet available (time lapse, etc)- turns out the power zoom lens includes digital zoom to double the zoom, the problem is that so far I can't tell you if you can turn off the digital zoom, making your pictures look awful.- the power zoom lens SELP1650 is available on this site to pre-order and can be used with other NEX cameras, I tested with my NEX 7 and it would work but would have issues retracting when you power off the camera, I hope this would be fixed with a firmware update when the lens comes out. Also, the digital zoom wasn't present when I used the lens on my NEX 7- Finally for me the last blow was the shoe attachment. I own a flash that I have used on the NEX 7 and really loved (especially if you are using a large lens, because I would get shadows from the built in flash). Guess what? as always, Sony has to come up with a brand new proprietary thing that makes my current flash useless and better, the ONLY flash from Sony that is available is bigger than the camera and costs $500.So, I decided to return the camera.My advice to you, spend another $300 or maybe less and buy the NEX 7.", "Date": "November 29, 2012"}, {"Title": "Not Mac compatible / Taken the joy out of photography", "Author": "Havana Joe", "ReviewID": "R1W4ZQ49POC4FP", "Overall": "1.0", "Content": "If you are a Mac user, you're out of luck with many of the hi-tech features of this camera -- the Wi-fi will not work, because the Sony-supplied software is not Mac compatible.

I spend way too much time staring at the back of the camera and fiddling with nested submenus.Performance: Many photos came out soft. At one point the camera froze up and would not turn off until I removed the battery.  I sent it in for warranty repair.  Since Sony was too cheap to include a plastic back cover for the lens,  when I sent it in, the back of the lens was uncovered.

The fact is that the autofocus on this camera is about three generations behind the competition and simply isn't good enough for any kind of hurried photography.  If all you do is take architecture photos or the \"say cheese\" family portraits then the autofocus wouldn't be an issue, however, there are much better camera choices for those kinds of photography so this camera wouldn't make sense in those situations.  But for any other kind of photography the autofocus on this camera would be very limiting.Panasonic and Olympus have figured this out and even Nikon's 1 series blows Sony's autofocus away, which should be especially embarrassing for Sony since it was Nikon's first generation of mirrorless, interchangeable cameras.  I owned the nex 5 & 5n and forgave their poor AF since they were early attempts, and were otherwise FANTASTIC but I can no longer abide paying top dollar for a camera that is severely deficient in such an important area.I also feel that Sony's lens strategy sucks but that's a moot point because I won't come back to them unless they can figure out the AF situation.

I quickly focused on the mirror-less interchangeable cameras in hopes of finding DSLR performance in a smaller body (I like taking pictures but rarely leave the house with the sole intention of taking pictures and thus don\u2019t see myself lugging around a DSLR very often).I fell in love with the Sony NEX6 on paper.  Great reviews\u2026 perfect size\u2026 built in flash\u2026 pancake lens\u2026 replacement to the NEX5 and alternative to the NEX7 (both of which also receive high praise)The only downsides in my mind at the time of purchase were cost and limited zoom capabilities.Then the disappointment set in\u2026 I started questioning the image quality a few days after purchase and decided to rum my own test to neutralize any user error on my part.  The test was simple yet thorough.  Using two tripods, I took simultaneous pictures using the Sony NEX6 and my old Panasonic FZ5.  I considered three subjects: a close-up coaster, my wife about 10 feet away, and a zoom picture of my wife.  In total I took about 100 pictures of these three images using all different settings on the NEX6 and the FZ5 (auto zoom, manual zoom, flash, no flash, aperture priority, shutter priority, portrait setting, etc.).  For each subject, I picked the best image from the Sony NEX6 and the best image from my old Panasonic FZ5.
