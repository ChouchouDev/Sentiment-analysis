This camera is ideal for novice photographers and experts alike! The user's manual is very easy to follow and understand, and the camera functions are extremely simple to use. I am very pleased with the picture quality, and had gorgeous pictures even on the very lowest image quality settings! This camera is worth every penny I paid for it, and I'd highly recommend it!

The printer is VERY easy to use and it's been nice when grandkids and friends come to our vacation house-we take many pictures and can send relatives and friends home with as many photos as they want.  No going to the store to get them developed! A wonderful advantage to this camera/printer set! The printer has an included electric cord, or you can purchase a battery to run the printer without electricity.  This camera takes several different quality photos depending what you set the \"MPs\" at.  Even I learned how to set the MPs! The greater the \"MPs,\" the clearer resolution of your photo.  This model M517 goes from 3MPs to 5.2MPs, but I found that the lower MPs take VERY acceptable quality pictures.  The higher the MPs, the less pictures your camera memory will hold before you'll need to delete some if you want to take more photos.  So I purchased a 1GB memory card that can store several HUNDRED photos even on the clearest resolution.  This is wonderful for vacations, weddings, etc.!  It is very easy to delete \"red eyes\" in your photos before printing them and you can also \"crop\" the photos if you want a closer-up photo.  The only \"con\" I have is that the rechargeable batteries do not last long-a few days depending on how often you have the camera on.  The camera batteries are recharged when you \"dock\" (set the)the camera on the printer.  I purchased a 4 pack of NiMH rechargeable batteries so I could always have spares on hand.  The recharger charges the camera batteries in ONE HOUR.  Charging batteries when the camera is docked on the printer takes several hours to do.  The whole package has what you need to start taking pictures immediately-even ink and photo paper.  Cables to connect to a computer and to a TV to view photos are all included. All in all, this Grandma is VERY satisfied with my new Photo Studio!", "Date": "November 9, 2006"}, {"Title": "A great camera", "Author": "Andre R.

Sometimes I switch the display off to spare energy and use the optical viewfinder that, not being a reflex, doesn't show you the picture you'll eventually get. In the next future I'll buy at least another couple of rechargeable or lithium batteries.People using old reflex cameras have to become accustomed to the shutter delay (default 0.85 sec) that captures not exactly what you wanted when you shot.My next camera, in the years to come, will be definitely a digital reflex but for the time being I enjoy my M517.

I am not a professional photographer but have been an avid photographer as a hobby since I was a kid.  I own another digital camera and received this one as a gift.  Thank GOODNESS I did not waste my own money on this piece of junk.Here are my main issues with the HP:1. The LCD screen sometimes goes black after taking a picture.  Nothing will bring it back without powering it down and bringing it back up.2. The pictures are NOT crystal clear.  They are clear enough, but they lack that sharp, focused look of my other digital camera.3. There is a TREMENDOUS lag time between when you \"take\" the picture and when the camera actually flashes and takes the picture.  I suppose if you're photographing a lot of adults or still objects, this is not a big issue.  I, however, spend most of my time these days photographing my kids.  I have missed MANY great shots because the picture you take and the picture the camera catches is NOT the same picture!  I know that some will argue that this is true of all digital cameras, and let me assure you that it is NOT.  My other camera has some lag, but I get reasonably close to the picture I wanted...if not the exact one.  This is my biggest complaint with this camera.4. My camera drains the batteries so quickly!  Friends of mine have this camera also (they also complain about #3), and theirs don't seem to do this.  I have tried various batteries without different results.  I can sometimes only take 6 or so pics before needing new batteries.  And this IS with the Ni rechargeables.I called HP to see what could be done about the tech issues, and ~SURPRISE~ my warranty expired a couple of weeks ago.
