{"Reviews": [{"Title": "The new DX standard...", "Author": "P. Hartung", "ReviewID": "R3H4I2GZHS04OV", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "While I'm hoping Nikon will release a D400, I couldn't resist trying out the new D7100.  As a working pro who uses both FX and DX format cameras, my first impressions of the D7100 are very positive.My simple summary is that this camera is a bargain and that those already inclined to own the best the DX camera Nikon sells should get one.Having worked for years with the D300 and the D7000 bodies, my perspective on this one is influenced by what I think is good about those two popular cameras.  I hoped that the D7100 would really improve in the areas of autofocus, shadow noise, and overall resolution/acuity.  This camera has not disappointed me, and has even a few minor improvements I wasn't expecting.Of first importance, shooters of the D7000 will appreciate the big improvements in AF (you probably know how sketchy that camera is to focus, especially compared to the 51-point standard set by most older/current pro bodies).  It's fast, accurate, and doesn't get fooled into moving if you recompose.  On single focus mode, it simply acquires and holds where you want.  And the tracking AF is on par with Nikon's pro standard.  This is huge for me, since I love the quality of images the D7000 gives but hate the unreliability of its AF.  Acquiring focus in low light seems a bit snappier and more accurate than even the D300.The resolving power of this sensor is unlike any DX camera before it.  Because the D7100 doesn't have an anti-aliasing/low-pass filter on its 24 megapixel sensor, I knew it would be able to show a perceptible increase in resolving detail over the older D7000, and again I am glad to report it does - IF you use good glass, stopped down a bit, and process from the RAW files.  My test shots captured with the Tokina 11-16 and Nikon 70-200 have blown me away.  The acuity when zoomed in is night/day compared to the D7000. However, if you use mediocre glass then the only differences you'll notice are larger files and slightly better dynamic range.In DX images, shadow noise has generally appeared too stippled even at lower ISO values, rendering a texture that the FX sensors don't have at the same ISO's.  The D7100 has definitely improved this.  The texture gradient is more uniform and it reminds me of the D600 in this way.  Although I haven't done tests above ISO 1600, the shadow textures are more uniform and pleasant (natural?) on skin than the previous DX cameras.Shooters familiar with Nikon's pro camera ergonomics will appreciate that the D7100 has added the quick magnification/zoom feature to the `OK' button on the rear thumbpad.  It's great for snappy, quick inspections at defined zoom ratios to check for focus accuracy.  This feature is nonexistent on the D7000 and the D600.  I find it very handy and preferable to the +/- buttons.Speaking of the +/- buttons to the left of the LCD, I have no idea why Nikon reversed their positions on this camera.  It's a small thing but still annoying.I'm still getting used to the new viewfinder display, so the jury is out.The two-shot HDR feature isn't what it should be since it doesn't align the images.  I'd use the bracketing feature on a tripod and be done with it.I like that there's finally a lock button in the center of the program mode dial to avoid accidental switching, which happens too often on the D7000.The rear LDC screen is slightly larger and also a bit crisper to my eyes.The overall fit/finish is solid and secure.  I have big hands so I only wish it was the same form factor as the D800 (hey Nikon, give us a D400 already), but at this price I'm not complaining.I wish Nikon could squeeze out better battery performance from their cameras, frankly, and the D7100 hasn't improved upon what has become normal for the past couple years.Sorry, but I don't mess with video so I cannot speak to this.As a still image camera (in the DX format) the D7100 has really set a new standard.  Even though I'd buy a D400 if it came out tomorrow, there's nothing stopping me from enjoying the D7100 today as the best you can get.  I feel that the price is low for what it is and can create.  Highly recommended...", "Date": "March 16, 2013"}, {"Title": "Perfect Upgrade from D5100", "Author": "Alan Montgomery", "ReviewID": "R2H685IIQ2S4FQ", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "***UPDATED 3/18/13 TO INCLUDE SOME MEMORY CARD BUFFER BENCHMARKS IN MEMORY CARD SECTION***This review is aimed at people who are relatively new to photography (~couple years), as I am in the same boat. There will be much more thorough reviews on Amazon for people who are already serious photographers, written by people who are actually serious photographers.General Impression:A wonderful upgrade from my D5100 after 2 years of heavy use.  This camera is obviously aimed at a different person than the D3x00 or D5x00 series as it offers quick access to advanced features without having to go through tons of menus.Construction/Feel:This camera feels like a series camera.  Coming from the all plastic D5100, this thing is built like a tank.  It is noticeably larger than my old camera, which is due to the fact that it has more knobs and wheels.Controls:One of the main reasons I wanted to upgrade from an entry level dSLR was so I can quickly change settings without having to hunt through menus to do so.  This camera fits the bill very well and has a few major upgrades from my point of view.  Fistly, the U1 and U2 settings are invaluable.  Being able to have a group of settings stored such that I can revert back to them by turning one knob is major.  Several times in the past I have been trying to compose one shot only to have a completely different shot appear that required different settings altogether.  This takes a while to do on the more entry level camera and has been very annoying.  Something that may not seem that important but I love already is the depth of field preview button.  I enjoy being able to see what the aperture setting will actually look like without having to take a shot and review on the LCD.  The final feature that I love are a collection of buttons/knobs/wheels that allow me to change things like shooting mode (continuous, timer, etc), AF mode, ISO setting, etc without having to get into a menu.  I haven't quite committed their location to memory but once I do I won't even have to take the camera away from my face to make the changes.  Again, this section here is really the reason I wanted to upgrade and I am not disappointed.Auto Focus:The 51-point AF on this camera has been a dream to use. I almost always keep the camera set to single point servo autofocus so I can select the point I want it to focus to. As long as you have some contrast, it is very quick and accurate to focus. A big positive in this camera over the lower level ones is that it DOES have a built in AF motor which means it will autofocus on lenses that do not have a built in motor.  I do have the Tokina 11-16mm 2.8 which lacks a motor, so I was stuck manually focusing it on my previous camera.  I notice this camera has a much faster focusing speed compared to the D5100 and also is able to focus in low light better, I believe its supposed to be a 1 stop improvement.LCD Screen:I do/will miss the rotating/articulating screen the D5100 had.  I can understand why on a semi-pro/prosumer camera they would remove it (it could fairly easily break off and does seem like somewhat of a gimmick), but I mainly enjoyed it because i could turn it around to protect the screen while transporting.  This screen is definitely a better quality though and shows much more information.Noise:Wonderful sensor, great signal to noise ratio.  With my D5100 I would start to see things go down hill around ISO1600-3200.  With this camera, I will be bumping that setting up to 6400 which gives me 1-2 stops of slack to play with.  A little noise reduction in editing software makes the images completely usable.  Very happy with the noise.  I'm guessing the full frame bodies do a better job in this category, but this camera does all I need it to.  Also, still waiting for Lightroom to update their camera compatibility.Image Quality:I'm not a pixel-peeper nor do I have the extensive experience to really discuss the image quality.  It takes good pictures if I compose good pictures.Battery Life:No complaints.  I have gotten a couple hundred shots off and still have half battery life.  I do expect to buy another battery at some point for times when I might be taking a couple thousand shots over a weekend.Memory Card:I enjoy being able to put two SD cards in here and plan to always use them in the backup mode (in case one should sheet the bed).  VERY IMPORTANT, BIG DEAL HERE:  The memory you put in is very important.  From my D5100 I had a few Transcend 16 GB Class 6 SDHC Flash Memory Card TS16GSDHC6E.  When I got the D7100, i felt the camera was not shooting as fast as it should.  I then bought one SanDisk Extreme Pro 32 GB SDHC Class 10 UHS-1 Flash Memory Card 95MB/s SDSDXPA-032G-AFFP and would like to explain the results of my tests.  So i set up on a tripod the same shot with each card at 14bit RAW uncompressed, as many as the camera take in 30 seconds.  The only difference was the cards.  The results are astounding and are not a typo.  I got 68 shots with the sandisk and 23 with the transcend.  That's right, almost 3x as many.  Additionally, but unrelated to the camera, when copying 30 pictures (at 23mb a piece) to my MacBook Pro, the Sandisk took 13 seconds and the Transcend 41 seconds.  If you aren't getting high performance out of your memory card, definitely look into upgrading.Flash:The built in flash is pretty puny, which seems to be par for the course. It does provide some nice fill lighting if you're outside taking pictures where there are some shadows on your subject, but for shooting inside it's marginal at best. I bought the very reasonably priced Nikon SB-400 AF Speedlight Flash for Nikon Digital SLR Cameras and have been very pleased with the combo. The external flash adds the ability to bounce light off the ceiling and not waste the camera battery while doing so. This camera does  have the Nikon flash commander ability which I will no doubt take advantage of at some point.Conclusion:If you're starting to outgrow your lower tier DX camera, get this one - you won't be disappointed.  I already have quite a few DX lenses and don't feel like replacing them with FX lenses and I actually prefer the crop factor (1.5x teleconverter in effect) on my big nasty 70-200 2.8.Highly recommended.", "Date": "March 16, 2013"}, {"Title": "A worthy upgrade for the skilled photographer", "Author": "Michael C. Jackson \"MysticMCJ\"", "ReviewID": "R3V4V5JFNSAJKX", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I picked up the body three days ago, as an upgrade to my D90 - I was particularly interested in the weather sealing, how it performed without an AA filter, and some of the goodies that filtered in from the prior model, like the dual SD slots.Coming from the D90, this is simply an astounding upgrade in terms of image rendition, range, light sensitivity, and performance...  but it takes spending some quality time becoming familiar with it to truly appreciate it.If you are the sort of person - like me - who simply starts tweaking things in advance without really testing them, then you can easily make things difficult for yourself.  Case in point: 51 AF points.  Coming from the D90, where I had 11, this seemed to be a really good thing, and it CAN be, in the right scenario.  However, if you blindly set it to use 3D tracking without considering your subject, the sheer density of the focus points combined with certain subjects can lead to a lot of focus-shifting back and forth.  The solution to this is to either use pure auto focus (and I know you purists are shaking your head already at that one, I know I was at first), change the AF mode to AF-S, or use less focus points.  I suspect if I had just left the focus as it shipped, I wouldn't have seen any issue at all.Much of what is new to me, like the custom modes, won't be new to somebody coming from the D7000, so I won't go into detail on those.  It does feel that this has become the definitive DX camera to track action - sports and wildlife in particular, given the new crop mode (which is of no use to me) and the aggressive focus tracking.  But there's plenty in there for other shooters as well, and the extra resolution and light sensitivity is never a bad thing.  What this really means is that this camera really has two types that will be particularly interested in it...  If you are looking to shoot action affordably, this is your new camera.  If you are an experienced user looking for the most advanced DX format Nikon has to offer at this time, this is also your camera.  However, if you are a novice, or if you are not willing to spend some time tuning it to how you work, this may be too much camera for you.It also seems like many of the enhancements were for movie modes - and I'm a stills guy, so I can't speak to those.  Technically, I'm sure it's amazing.From an image resolution standpoint - there are two things that may give a false impression that this camera doesn't perform as you would expect.  The first: Sharpening is set extremely low by default, so the first time you zoom in to 100%, you are probably going to have a question or two.  Dialing up the sharpness fixes that quite nicely if you are a sharpness junkie.  The second:  Your own technique.  And by this, I mean knowing what aperture to shoot in, really knowing how to be steady, knowing how to release the shutter without adding rotational motion - There are a ton of factors that could affect this.  So if you are still aren't happy with the sharpness after dialing it up, set your camera in aperture priority, dial it up to 8 (or whatever is optimal for your lens, but 8 is a safe bet), set it on something heavy, check your focus in live mode, and use a timer release mode.  You will quickly see where the problem is, and unless you have a really awful lens, I'll take the odds that it's NOT the camera that is the problem- This thing is SHARP.  It is only limited by the lens and the operator.Now, for those of you worried about moire, I have some good news for you: I've been shooting repeating patterns - pinstripes, grid textures, you name it - trying to create moire.  I have yet to succeed...  I'm sure it's possible, but I haven't been able to coax it out yet.  Point is - it will take some effort to make that happen, and I don't think that should factor in your decision.My gripes are incredibly minor.  The new \"i\" menu screen is laid out very intelligently and greatly eases camera operation, but it also just about makes the \"info\" button redundant - I'd rather have had the ability to hit \"i\" or \"info\" twice - once to show info, the other to open the menu - and have the ability to remap the additional button to something else.Quiet mode, well, isn't very.  Probably not distinct to this model over any other Nikon SLR with quiet mode, but I was expecting more.And why did Nikon take away my ability to toggle on the info screen along with the LCD backlight?These are minor gripes, and I'm hard pressed to come up with anything.  I've seen people complain about the buffer size, but I just shot 32 full-size JPGs at full speed before it started slowing down as I was writing this.  There may be some focus issues for some people, but for me it was technique along with camera settings.  I've been looking for things to criticize, and it's just not that easy.  What I have is a truly significant upgrade that has astounded me with its performance, and is an improvement in every way from the already strong D90 I was coming from.  There's a lot of ways to shoot yourself in the foot with settings, so you need to be mindful of what you are tweaking, but there's a lot of power to be unlocked as well.Very highly recommended.UPDATE: 3/6/2013I was a bit wrong about quiet mode...  The shutter is quiet to begin with, so the effect didn't seem as dramatic as I expected.  The reality is that it's already worlds quieter than the D90 ever was.Also, note that I rarely if ever shoot raw.  The great thing about this is that I have felt a need to with this camera.  That does significantly degrade the rapid-fire speed, and I understand that moire can exhibit in raw, but I haven't seen that in practice yet.  I'll reserve judgement until there's support for this in Aperture or Lightroom, as I've never been crazy about Nikon's offerings.Using this as a flash commander in conjunction with my SB-600 is AWESOME.  I could do that with the D90 as well, but it seems to work much more consistently and rapidly than it did before.  The on-board flash seems ridiculously competent.My other minor gripe: The record movie button just hangs around uselessly if you aren't in video mode.  Remapping that would be nice as well.  I'm not holding my breath for any firmware updates.", "Date": "March 21, 2013"}, {"Title": "NIKON D7100- 5 star", "Author": "Bear 57", "ReviewID": "R1K62MM0PMEYG2", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I'm not going to go into a long review on this model- the D7100. I have been taking pictures for over 50 years, and I will just say, for the price I paid, this is 1 of the finest Nikon's yet. Coming from my past, including D50, D90, D7000, the D7100 has made great improvements, and I have NO ISSUES with the D7100. Maybe some of these other guys who have given scathing reviews have gotten an off copy, or maybe it is simply a case of inability to know how to use the camera properly, who knows? Regardless, if you are looking for a SUPERIOR camera in the $1200 range, THIS IS IT! Buy it, most importantly, READ THE MANUAL, use a fast, highly-rated memory card, a high-quality lens, and don't look back! Everything about the D7100 screams quality- from the build quality, features, resolution, and most importantly, TACK-SHARP photo quality. I could go on an on about the D 7100, but it is best to just remark about what an awesome buy it is now for the $. All the others(manufacturers) are now playing catch-up with this Nikon release- Yes, others may say it can use this feature, and that do-dad, but we all know that will come in less than 2 years or so.

D7100. Rather than rehash all of the camera specs in this review, I'll focus on what has changed vis-a-vis the previous camera.NEW 24.1 MEGAPIXEL SENSOR, 1.3x CROP MODE, NO AA FILTERAlthough I didn't really care about having more megapixels, there are advantages. The most obvious is cropping and the 1.3x crop mode is a nice feature if you are into bird & wildlife photography. The crop mode delivers an in camera crop that essentially discards pixels around the outer perimeter of the image (instead of a 6000x4000 DX image, the camera captures a cropped 4800x3200 image). Because the resulting cropped files are smaller (about 16 megapixel) the cameras gets a slight boost in frame rate to 7 fps. There are focusing advantages as well, since all 51 focus points cover almost the entire frame of the image. Nikon has worked wonders with the 24.1 megapixel sensor, delivering amazing resolution detail while keeping noise in check. The noise that appears in higher ISO images has a grain quality that's more pleasing to my eye than previous Nikon cameras I have owned (YMMV). The removal of the AA filter is icing on the cake, placing this camera in the company of the D800E (which merely canceled its AA filter - the D7100 deletes it altogether). The new crop mode, combined with enhanced sharpness, were key selling points to me. After extensive use of the D7100, I'm happy to report that the camera is SHARP SHARP SHARP. (And did I mention that it is SHARP?) I was never 100% pleased with the sharpness of images coming out of my D7000, but this new camera is amazing in that department. Whether this performance is the result of the deletion of the AA filter, I do not know - but I know the camera is sharp.NEW WEATHER-SEALED BODYThe camera feels great in my hands, solid and substantial without being a brick. The body is now fully weather sealed (reportedly to the standard of the D800) and the button layout changes are logical and well thought out. I like the new \"i\" button - it's a cinch to change key camera settings, especially toggling the image area between DX and 1.3x crop modes. Nikon has tweaked the ergonomics nicely, with the larger thumb rest and raised \"OK\" button control pad. The LCD screen is 3.2\", larger, brighter, and higher resolution than the D7000 screen. ALL of these changes are subtle but significant improvements. Note also that pressing the \"OK\" button during shot review zooms to a 100% review of the image at the focus point, allowing you to pixel peep on the fly - a great feature that will become essential once you start using it.51 AUTOFOCUS POINTSThe AF is improved as well, with a whopping 51 AF points (that extend edge-to-edge in 1.3x crop mode). The camera focuses quickly and (for the most part) accurately.COLORI'm liking the color captured by the D7100 better than that of the D7000 (and its Sony sensor). It's warmer and more organic to my eye.VIDEO UPGRADESI shoot a lot of video, so I'm happy about the new frame rates (including 60P). The new location of the movie record button, next to the shutter release, makes sense. I'm particularly happy that we now have a headphone jack on the camera. Sure, we don't always use the in camera audio, but it is nice to be able to monitor it now if necessary. The camera LCD display now sports audio level indicators, too.POSSIBLE WEAKNESSESThe sharp 24 megapixels demand better lenses and better technique to get the results you want - is that a weakness? In other words, the ceiling of performance is higher with the D7100, but you will need the lens and technique to take advantage of it.The buffer could be larger - this will be the Achilles Heel for some bird shooters. By limiting the buffer, Nikon has left the door open for a true D300 replacement to slot above this camera in the lineup. For me, the many considerable upsides of the D7100 outweigh the buffer issue.I'm not a big fan of the new locking control dial (I never had problems with the old dial) but it works fine - it just slows down operation a bit, and I worry that it may break. Just a minor quibble: the shutter sound is different, perhaps a little louder, than the D7000 shutter.CONCLUSIONBrilliant camera. Nikon has dialed up the D7000 in every area you would expect, and a few you would not expect. The D7000 is an outstanding camera, but the D7100 offers improvements across the board. Better weather-sealed body, better ergonomics, more resolution, better color, more AF points, no AA filter, a 1.3X crop mode, a headphone jack, 60P frame rate, on screen audio levels. And did I mention that it is SHARP SHARP SHARP?The D7100 is the best DX camera to date.", "Date": "March 22, 2013"}, {"Title": "Great all-around enthusiast DSLR", "Author": "W. Chase", "ReviewID": "R1K6K9EY4Y9FVR", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "To give some background, I started out with a D40 (entry level DSLR) back in 2008.  Had that for a couple of years and felt it was time to upgrade.  I went a step up in class to a D5100 in 2011.  Really enjoyed this camera, it's abilities, and it's additional (manual) controls.  Towards the end of this year, I decided it was time to upgrade to the next class and step into the D7xxx class.  I decided on the D7100 because the D7000 was similar (in many ways) to my D5100, which shared the same sensor.  As a side note, I don't feel that getting the newer version of a camera in the same class is an upgrade.  Maybe if you waiting a 2-3 versions, but not the next one.  There isn't typically that many features that would persuade me to go from a D7000 to a D7100 based off of my friends (2 of them own the D7000) and what I've read about the D7100.  But, for me, the D7100 was the next logical choice.I'm not sure what I can say that hasn't already been written in previous reviews, so let me try from a different angle.  I'll discuss some of the items that are not typically listed on a spec sheet or a comparison list:Larger camera (body) size isn't always a negative.  We live in a world were small (and faster, of course) is typically better when technology is involved.  But with cameras, especially for me and my larger hands, bigger is better.  The mid-size D7100 just feels more comfortable in my hands compared to the Compact size of the D40, D3xxx/Dxxx classes of Nikons.  The D7100 also has the ability to add on a (Nikon) battery grip for increased battery life and better ergonomics when it comes to taking portraits.  The D7100 also has weather sealing, so if you like to continue some level of photography after the rain or snow begins to fall, this is a better option than the entry level classes.  Another nice option is that the D7100 has the ability to mount a teleconverter to extend the range of the telephoto lenses.My recommendation is if you are new to photography or new to DSLR photography, the D7100 is probably not the best economical choice.  It's relatively complex and many manual controls.  Opting for a D3xxx or D5xxx series camera is probably a better buy.  They are replaced with a new version just about on a yearly basis, so you can find last year's model pretty cheap.If you already have a D3xxx or D5xxx and feel like you are starting to hit it's potential and/or would like more manual control of the settings (instead of diving into the menus to changes settings), the D7xxx series is probably your best choice.  Unless you are coming from a D5100 or D5200, the D7000 is a great economical purchase.  It has great abilities.If you are coming from a D5100 (like me) or D5200/D5300, the D7100 is the better choice in this price range.  The D600/D610 and D800 are somewhat of a different animal, are more expensive (although the D600 oil issue is driving the price down), and may cause you to spend more money to get rid of your DX lenses and opt for the FX lenses.I hope you found this review useful.", "Date": "December 5, 2013"}, {"Title": "Sweet. New D7100 images are terrific--camera too!", "Author": "drdvde \"drdvde\"", "ReviewID": "R3OWYM4RQD9QQO", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I received my D7100 yesterday afternoon and shot some pictures that are posted here, \"a picture is worth a thousand words.\" I had the Nikkor 28-300 mounted so I was getting a 35 mm equivalent of 42-600 mm with the 1.3 crop factor feature. Note this is an FX lens. I have never encountered this before, but Adobe Camera Raw and Lightroom have not caught up with being able to process the D7100 RAW files, so all my images posted here were converted in Nikon NX2. Using NX2, you can do some crude editing (adequate for some, perhaps) and can convert to jpegs or 8/16 bit tiffs. All were shot handheld at f/8, ISO 200 (except for the tulips, ISO 1600) at shutter speeds ranging from 1/500 to 1/1000 (sunset was shot at 1/60, tripod mounted). Original raw files are 24 megapixels and were quickly transferred via USB 3.0 reader from Kensington. Operation of the D7100 is essentially identical to the D7000, which I gave to my daughter. A few minor differences, but nothing significant. Using the \"i\" button on the back of the camera makes switching between DX and 1.3 crop mode VERY simple; this would be great for bird stalking if you need a little more reach or sports where the 51 focus points would essentially cover the FOV. In DX mode, you get 24mp, in 1.3 crop mode, something less than 16mp. I think the best aspect of this is the way the focus points cover the entire width of the image area.After shooting the quick \"one offs\" posted here, I would have to pronounce this camera \"sweet.\" I like the DX format and the 1.3 crop factor. Expeed 3 processor seems comparable to my 800E. IQ seems terrific. Dynamic range is superb, but hard to completely tell at this point without proper software. Bottom line, while some may scoff at this model as merely evolutionary, to me, it continues the very strong reputation of the D7000, and \"son of D7000\" is not too shabby a moniker ;) I have encountered no QC issues with the images, sensor, or other bits, but I have only had the camera for less than a day. I will update this if things change. I loved my D7000; I can tell I am going to love the D7100 as well. I will use this camera primarily for bird and animal stalking, but may also take it when I don't want to risk my D800E (the D7100 IQ is terrific enough and the camera is weather sealed as well).PS A note about moire. The D7100 doesn't have an anti-aliasing filter, the 800E neutralizes the AA filter's effects. With my 800E, I have NEVER seen problems with moire (after a few thousand images) and I don't see why the D7100 would be a concern in this regard. Yes, I am aware of all the technical caveats. You can see more of my work at on my website if you want to see more (just click on \"drdvde\" above to see the link.)UPDATE 4/3/13: Just returned from a trip to Arches National Park. D7100 performed terrifically. Using the 1.3x crop factor, I can get an effective 600 mm from my Nikkor 28-300 mm zoom FX lens. Pictures were sharp, but two issues are important until Adobe provides compatible software. It is possible to \"hack\" the exiv data of the raw camera files using the exiftool program (google it!) so that ACR and Lightroom and Photoshop thing their dealing with a D5200 file. This works reasonably well with DX mode images (program works flawlessly, but the process is convoluted). In 1.3x crop mode, however, things come to a halt. You can view your images in Bridge, but you can't ge them to load into ACR and they cannot be converted to DNG format by Adobe DNG Converter. You'd be limited to converting to jpeg or tiff using Nikon ViewNX2, as shown in some of my images above.UPDATE later 4/3/13: Adobe DNG Converter v7.4 and Lightroom v4.4 now support the D7100", "Date": "March 23, 2013"}, {"Title": "Finally-- Worth Upgrading For!", "Author": "Matthew Pearson", "ReviewID": "R2E5LBBIO4JST2", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "This is my 4th DSLR. Before this, I had a Kodak DCS-460c, a D70, and a D80. The latter two are still very capable cameras as long as you're not too obsessed about pixel peeking. When it comes to actual images, I had a hard time finding fault with either. I just used the D70 to shoot some downhill longboarding this past summer, and the high flash sync helped me grab some pretty great shots in poor lighting conditions. In fact, I'd probably still be using it primarily if I hadn't dropped it about a year after buying it. I replaced it immediately (out of necessity) with a D80, which has been a workhorse of a camera (a year and a half ago, I figured out the problem with my D70 and fixed it myself, that's how I was able to use it again more recently).Anyway! All of this is to explain that I had a hard time finding a reason to upgrade to a newer body. I would love to have an FX body, because I built the bulk of my lens collection while shooting film and having my wide lenses actually be wide again would be great. I just couldn't justify the cost, though! However, once the D7100 hit, it was in a sweet spot in price and had 4x the resolution of my D70 and about 2.5x that of my D80 making it a significant upgrade. Put that together with its ability to meter with AIS lenses and it's purported high-ISO performance and it was just a matter of getting the money together.I had a lot of time to take some shots with it over the last half week or so and I have been very, very impressed with its fast focus and the quality of high-ISO images. With my previous bodies and their Gen-1 sensors, quality started to drop off rapidly after an ISO of 800. At 1600 the images weren't just undersaturated and grainy, they were obviously digital with streaks and strangely colored pixels. The D80 could be pushed to 3200, but why? It was mostly useless.On the D7100, though, I shot several images at ISOs over 3200 and often at 6400. One thing I noticed is that while \"grain\" does begin to become apparent at high ISOs, it looks a lot more like film grain than digital noise. Some of the monochrome shots I took at 6400 look more like 4-800 speed film. It's classy-looking noise, I suppose. It's definitely nicer looking than any 1600 or 3200 speed film I've ever shot on 35mm.Autofocus is also very fast and more accurate than it was with my older bodies. I was surprised at how quickly it focused and locked onto subjects with my 80-200 2.8 AF-S lens, and I never complained about it being slow on my older bodies. It's very snappy and accurate. With my D80 I'd often be frustrated with the low-light performance of my fast lenses (50mm 1.4 and 35 1.8) and actually wondered if my 35mm lens was actually defective. The focal plane was always a little bit off from where I'd wanted it. This hasn't completely vanished with the 7100, but I think there were only 2 or 3 images out of the several hundred I've shot so far that show evidence of the camera being a little confused about where to focus. That alone has made shooting far less stressful!Physically, the body is smaller than the D70 but larger than the D80. I don't have enormous hands, but I'm a bigger than average person (statistically). The D70 fits my hand perfectly. I had to get the grip for the D80 or else I felt like the camera was going to slip from my hand. My little finger just sort of flapped in the breeze while I was holding onto the gripless D80. The D7100 is in the middle of the two. I wish it were closer in size to the D70, but I do feel like I can grasp it solidly. I'll probably eventually get the MB-D15, but it feels slightly less crucial (though I already miss the vertical shutter release and controls).Over all, this is a very significant upgrade over my older DSLRs. Maybe if I had a newer one it would feel incremental, but this was definitely the body I didn't know I was waiting for for all of these years. The low-light performance alone is incredible for those of us who like to use available light; maybe high-iso images are grainier than they'd be with a D600, but I'd prefer to have the 51-point AF system from the D4 than worry about a little high-iso noise that actually looks fairly filmic. Some might disagree with me on that point and I might evolve in my opinion about the D7100's noise when speeds get over 2400 or so, but I'll worry about that later.", "Date": "March 28, 2013"}, {"Title": "D7100 vs. D600", "Author": "A. Rubin", "ReviewID": "R3ARS963VIIFEN", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "Comparing this camera to the D600, I have found that color rendition and sharpness are nearly identical. The D7100 is a little lighter (noticeably), and has some slight differences in the button arrangement on the back. For example, the D600 has a button dedicated to picture control (standard, vivid, etc.), while the D7100 has the \"I\" button (which takes an extra step to get to picture control). The D7100 has the very handy zoom feature on playback, which allows you to set the OK button to zoom into the focal point upon playback. I missed this feature on the D600 (which the D800 has too).So the sensor size does not seem to be a factor in color/sharpness, but it is definitely a factor in high ISO noise. A comparison at high ISOs shows a clear difference in the two cameras, with D600 looking much better. I see a very slight difference already at ISO 500.I didn't see any difference between the LCD screen quality indoors.The D7100 has some other nice advantages, like better focal coverage and higher flash sync speed, so it is difficult to decide which is the better camera. Sometimes the DX crop factor is useful (like for zooms), but other times the FX is useful (for wides, or if you don't want lenses like the great 85mm 1.8G to be to close).In short, two great cameras. The D600 is lacking some features, and the D7100 is lacking (compared to the D600) at high ISO.

Just be sure you take the time to setup the camera the way you prefer it before you rush out and start taking pictures.  I upgraded from the D7000, which is a great camera in its own right.  This one blows it away in all aspects from low light shots to portraits or landscapes and everything in between.  It is a little bit lighter than the D7000 and it feels great in my hands.  I have not used the video yet so I can't comment on that part.  The 1.3x crop is more useful than I expected.  It is wonderful for sports shots for the extra length it provides on your lenses.  That means my 18-200mm lens is about equal to 390mm when zooming in.  Again, the pictures in this mode are very good and this is where you can get 7 shots in burst mode.

Otherwise, the D7000 remains a fantastic camera and a great bargain.* The low light focusing is significantly improved.  Where the D7000 would just cycle back and forth, the D7100 usually locks on reliably. 51 vs 39 focus points doesn't get me too excited.* Haven't run the tests yet, but no back-focusing so far.* The resolution of the 24mp sensor without the OLPF is simply fantastic at low ISOs.* Some better channel separation on the stereo mic would have been nice, but performance is adequate overall.  At least I don't have to lug around that separate mic anymore.  The cabling on the outside of the camera is a PITA.* I would reckon the low light performance is better by around a half stop in absolute terms.  But the grain is finer and smoother, so where I would stop at 3200 if possible on the D7000, I am going to 6400 on the D7100 without feeling too dirty.  Family pics, not pro stuff.

There seem to be some other QA issues reported here, so I would STRONGLY recommend checking out all the camera functions ASAP after receiving your unit.  2nd copy has been fine so far *knocks wood*.* Still haven't figured out how to do Auto ISO on the movie setting.  Adjusting manually for now.  Guess I should read the manual.Otherwise, I feel right at home with D7100, having used the D7000 since shortly after its release.I was considering the D600 heavily as well, but decided to stick with DX because I LIKE the 1.5x crop factor -- it gives a little extra reach and you're using only the sweet spot of FX lenses.  I also wanted the stereo mic and did not like the whole D600 oil spot issue.

First, when you set the camera to either A or S mode, you can go into custom functions and set the camera's other speed dial to adjust the ISO.  This is a great feature because otherwise I've seen some folks lamenting the inability to more easily change the ISO.  Brilliant!  Second, when you are reviewing multiple photos and zooming in to the same region of each one to inspect one important detail, the camera will automatically zoom into that region of the photo on successive zooms.  Very cool, and useful since the multi-toggle is a bit small and sensitive.

I'm glad I waited until this new camera was available. It is in good company with my D300s. I bought this as my backup body but in the short time I have used it, I am really impressed. If you have read any of my other reviews, you'd know I am a huge Nikon fan and have been shooting with their cameras for over 40 years. I am also a huge fan of the DX format.The D7100 has a couple of features not available on the D300s. At first I thought it was a dumbed down D300s, but after shooting a couple hundred images with every lens that I own, I'm finding that some of the features are very useful. In particular, it has the ability of cropping the image area to a 1.3X factor. Simply put, a 300mm DX lens becomes a 390mm lens. I have been using my Nikkor 80mm to 400mm AF ED lens and since it is an FX format lens it becomes a 120mm to 600mm and when you use the 1.3X crop function it maxes out at 780mm!The new features are many, but the ones I like the best include the display of the virtual horizon thru the viewfinder, auto focus in live view mode, the 1.3X crop function and the ability to shoot 6-fps! The fast frame rate is only possible when using an extreme SDHC card. The D7100 has 2 SDHC card slots, so you can record RAW on the first card and JPEG on the second. OR, you can create backup copies (as you shoot) on the second card. Nice!Now for the down side - it only shoots RAW and JPEG - unlike the D300s which will also shoot TIF's. The second \"gotcha\" is the RAW processing, version 7.4, isn't out yet! Yes, Adobe has a BETA you can download, but I haven't been able to make it work. I'm sure they will get it together before long. The other thing that surprised me was a long list of \"Program\" modes - 18 of them! That's where the dumbed down aspects come in. I guess if you are looking for simplicity...it's there! OK, now back to the really good features...The LCD screen is the brightest and sharpest I have seen on any camera! Nikon came up with a new way to display things - RGB+W. That's right, Red, Green, Blue and White. Also they have added 2 user defined settings to the mode dial. Let's say you want to shoot B&W;, you can program that for \"U1\" and maybe HDR, \"U2\". Very handy! There is one additional item on the menu which is really great - \"Recent Settings\" - finally, you can have a look at your latest set of changes!

I spent about 2 weeks looking at reviews all over the internet, comparing, and comparing, until I decided to finally purchase the D7100.Out of the BoxFirst thing I noticed was that it feels of cheaper build than the D7000, and that the shutter release also didn't feel or sounded as smooth as I had hoped. I just didn't get the feeling that I was using a better version of my D7000.Also there were Oil Marks on the camera out of the box. :( (If you are not comfortable doing wet cleaning, this might be a big issue for you)Shooting /Image Quality I had to shoot JPG for two main reasons, 1) No RAW support at the time 2) In-Camera HDR only works with JPG.Out of the box photos taken with the D7100 look sharper but also grainer in comparison with the D7000 Even at Low ISOs. YES even at Low ISO. (I didn't want to believe this, since I really wanted to like the D7100)I liked the HDR feature, since I could have an OK HDR picture in seconds to share it on the Internet. However, I wanted to get natural looking pictures, but I usually ended up with pictures looking like a Beginner's Photoshop Homework, but I really hope this was just me, since I want this feature to work properly on this or future Nikon cameras.Focusing/PointsThe 51 Focusing points were very nice to use, especially at the 1.5 X Cropped modes, but nothing really worth the update from a D7000. (This doesn't give your lens extra reach precisely, it just means the picture is cropped, allowing you to use only the juicy part of your lens and to shoot faster)I must say that I did not get any back or front focusing, but also didn't get that great improvement that I was hoping for in the D7100, in fact a few times while shooting, the camera wouldn't focus fast enough.Pros D710051 Focusing PointsIn-Camera HDRMore Mega PixelsSharper ImagesCons D7100Grainer PhotosBuild Quality could be an Issue. (Oil Marks, Cheaper Feel, etc.)(I hope I just had a Bad Apple)ConclusionI will probably be repeating what I have read many times before, but I had to experience it myself first hand to really get it.If you have a D7000, you already have a great camera, use the money to get better lens, probably even go FX. (I hate to say this since I really wanted to keep the D7100)If you are coming from anything lower than a D7000 and you have the extra few dollars to burn, the D7100 is a good option, although probably getting the D7000 and maybe a 50mm 1.8G and/or a 35mm 1.8G would be a better choice.Note:I have returned my D7100, and decided to wait for maybe a newer version of the D600 FX.I believe that if you are looking for something above the d7000 you will have to go Full Frame to really see a huge difference on your everyday shooting.", "Date": "May 6, 2013"}, {"Title": "A Tremendous machine", "Author": "W.

It was out of stock and my local camera shop had it, so... I have been learning and using it for about two weeks now and the controls are getting 'friendly' with me.Meaning: read the manual cover to cover with the camera in your lap. Preform the function as you read it in the manual, to get some sort of 'muscle-memory'. After a very short learning curve, the camera controls become intuitive. I have fairly large hands and this body fits like it was made for me. The weight/balance is perfect, as well.Growing into all this camera can accomplish will take years, no matter what the 'pros',(being a former film pro myself), say.

When the Nikon D7100 was introduced, I followed the discussion as to whether it was or was not the replacement.  Frankly, amid purely speculative rumors of a D400, I remain unsure.  However, the D7100 is clearly a contender for the position (and with a 1.3 crop factor sensor versus the 1.5 of the D300s).First off, it is important to note that while there are sometimes issues with first production runs of cameras, many of the issues I researched were unusual in comparison to number of units sold.  Many reported issues such as sharpness are simply from people who may be buying equipment that exceeds their skill level.  For example, as you increase pixels and gather more data, proper steady hand-holding techniques become critical and the camera is less forgiving.  This is why I advise people I give classes to seriously consider not jumping into advanced gear.  While improper focusing and hand-holding issues may be barely evident on a D300s (12mp), they are very evident on a D800 (36 mp).  Regardless, it is important to take every review with a \"grain of salt.\"  Even my review.I am a freelance part-time professional photographer and my review is in that context.  Many full time pros are very hard on their gear.  I am not.  Nevertheless, I found the build quality of the D7100 on par with my D300s, just smaller, lighter, and arguably more ergonomic for smaller hands.  Pro's will definitely opt for the grip.  Though it will probably not matter to many D7100 buyers, the D7100 is not built with the same magnesium alloy frame of the D300s though it does incorporate partial alloy in critical areas.  Like the D800 and D300, the D7100 is weather sealed.  Neither of these features is likely to sway someone looking at the D7100 nor should it.  Camera use cycles (not life cycles) are estimated around 2-4 years.  That means at this level of camera purchase, it is likely the purchaser will keep the camera for that duration; a duration that more or less coincides with Nikon product release cycles for this class of camera (DX format).  The D100 was released in 2002, the D200 in 2005, the D300 in 2007, the D300s in 2009, and now the D7100.  Though the D7000 was released in 2010, no one considered it even a possible successor to the D300s unlike the D7100, which appears a contender in this regard.  Based on all this information, it appears likely that users will ditch their camera models well before issues of build quality come into play.  At most, resale value may be affected.The D7100 is a multimedia convergence device and builds on that strength.  It blurs the line between still image and video art.  In fact, I recently recommended this  camera as an all in one solution to an organization that was starting up its public relations department and needed to capture massive amounts of video and still images.  Nikon's 24 mp DX format CMOS sensor in the D7100 avoids the use of a low pass filter and thus improves sharpness (with proper technique) with \"usable\" (subjective term I rarely shoot beyond ISO 200) ISO to 6400 with perceptible noise issues beginning to develop around ISO 1600.  There are significant improvements to focusing and speed processing through the use of a 51 point focus system and Expeed 3 processing (2016-pixel RGB evaluative sensor)- a significant improvement over the D7000 (many reported focusing speed issues).  The D7100 also incorporates 15 cross type sensors for horizontal and vertical contrast detection.  Significantly, and perhaps what most aspiring film producers look at most, the camera provides 1080p video in a variety of formats with an array of scalability (jacks, external monitors, HDMI out, WU-1a Wireless Mobile Adapter, etc..). Since video is not my area of expertise, I will rely on other reviewers to report their experiences.  My short experience with testing the video yielded professional results very quickly.  I just can't deal with amount of processing time needed at my computer.In the area of still photography, usability and end products were exceptional. First, the D7100 viewfinder utilizes a high-contrast OLED display for much improved viewfinder clarity at 100% coverage (the LCD is is also slightly larger).  Focusing was fast and dead on (my 80-200 2.8 locked on with laser precision).  As I said before, the D7100 has much improved focusing and processing speed as well as AF tracking with face priority (which, I rarely use).  This might also be influenced by the elimination of the low pass filter in front of the sensor.  My low light comparison tests to the D300s put the focusing speed at about the same or just slightly slower.  The elimination of the filter also provides greater ability of the sensor to resolve image detail.  However, using cheap lenses will offset against the D7100.  In my tests, this was extremely evident as I compared results.  ISO performance is also notably improved with less noise than the D7000, especially in darker areas of the image.  Underlying texture in the shadows seems more even- a more pleasing gradient of transition perhaps.  The dynamic range improvement as well as the ability to resolve images is likely due to the 1.3 crop factor versus the 1.5 crop factor found on other Nikon DX cameras.  But one again, it is important to understand that all these advances require proper shooting techniques because you are capturing more detail (data).  If you are a shooter who is erratic and uneven on the shutter release and/or you compose in such a manner that you crop large amounts in post-processing, the weaknesses will be magnified.  This is the reason so many people returned the D800 citing issues with the camera that seemed to end up being technique issues.  Keep this in mind.  Of note also is the use of U1 and U2 mode, which provides the ability to set and retain custom camera settings and easily switch settings back and forth (inside and outside for example).  For shooters who appreciate a very smooth shutter release, something that should not be overlooked, you will not be disappointed.  The shutter release on this camera is very smooth and even.I could go on for pages.  However, much anything else I write will have already been covered by either other reviewers or more qualified technical folks on the Web.Let me close out by saying this is a sharp, fast, and accurate camera with a sensor that provides great dynamic range.  24 mp is seriously more than you will ever need unless you plan on making billboard fine art prints.  But, at the same time, as you move up in the range of camera, camera's start becoming unforgiving of bad technique.  If you find your images are not sharp or your focus is off, step back and re-examine your shooting techniques.  Start by placing your camera on a tripod and shooting an inanimate object under very controlled lighting conditions.  This will provide a good baseline from which to measure camera performance without a host of shooter variables such as camera shake, shutter stabs, or focusing problems. Compare the tripod shot to your hand-held shot under the same conditions. From there, you can determine if it is a camera issue or user issue.", "Date": "April 25, 2013"}, {"Title": "Good companion to my D700", "Author": "RP in PA", "ReviewID": "R3TA6INNX0YU16", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "I have owned the Pentax K5, the Nikon D3100, and the Nikon D700.  I still have my D700 (love that camera), and after selling my Pentax K5 (loved that one too but needed better auto-focus for sports) I wanted a crop-sensor body for kids' sports which I could use my Nikon lenses with.I tried the d7000 out for about 2 weeks.  It severely back-focused.  With that camera, about 1 out of 10 photos were \"keepers\" so I sent it back and decided to wait and see what the next Nikon release would be.When the D7100 came out I knew I would be buying it - aside from the small buffer size it looked like it had all the right specs for my needs.  I purchased a copy locally about 3 weeks ago and gave it a try. I used a Nikon 80 - 200mm 2.8D lens for indoor sports and found that in the artificial lighting of the indoor sports arena the focus was frequently \"off\", and my resulting photos were very noisy and \"soft\".  I tried my Nikon 85mm 1.4D, a Nikon 35mm 1.8, as well as a few other lenses in a variety of lighting conditions and found that the camera had very inconsistent metering.  I felt like I was fiddling constantly to try to get the correct exposure even in more than adequate light.  I sent the D7100 back too...Last week I decided to give the camera one more try and purchased a second body from an online retailer.  So far it looks like this second body has none of the obvious issues of the first, and I am very happy with the images I am getting from it.  The low light performance is not as good as expected (still a lot of noise and some banding from ISO 1600 and above), and the higher resolution of the sensor does not necessarily translate to better photos except under certain conditions - but ultimately it offers a nice complement to my lower resolution full-frame camera. The focus is fast and accurate, and when used in adequate lighting it does most of what it sets out to do and is capable of producing exceptional images.  I will still use my D700 for portraits, low light (and indoor) sports, but will likely use the D7100 for family snapshots, walks with kids, landscape shooting and outdoor sporting events.That being said, if Nikon would offer a full frame camera just like the d700 with the added U1 & U2 settings, 20 - 24mp resolution and a DX mode for sports (and no oily sensor problems) I would ditch both of my current cameras and buy that one instead!", "Date": "April 14, 2013"}, {"Title": "Nice step up from my Nikon D300", "Author": "Amazon Customer \"Gurgs\"", "ReviewID": "R2KNO83W0LOGI9", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "After a month, about 1,500 photos and 2 hours of video, I can say my new Nikon D7100 overall is a nice step up from my old D300 (purchased in Dec2007).  The D7100 is smaller and lighter than the D300 plus the D7100 shoots video.  While it's video capabilities cannot touch my wife's Sony HDR-CX550V digital video camera, the D7100 is far more convenient to use versus lugging around both the D300 and HDR-CX550V.  The D7100 will AF in live view video mode, something that I do not believe Canon digital SLR cameras will do.D7100 vs. D300:  D7100 has the same to faster autofocus speed and sensitivity, better image quality, the same to better color, and metering accuracy is about the same or slightly better than the D300.  Both the D7100 and D300 suffer from a small memory buffer - in high speed frame advance (6 fps) the buffer fills and slow down about 2-3 fps after 7 or 8 consecutive shoots.  At 4 fps or slower, I can shoot to my hearts content with the D7100.  I do not really care for the D7100's user customizable banks, as they are limited to only two.  The D300 has several user customizable banks, but they are accessible only through the camera's menu system (call this a stalemate).  The D300 is more ruggedly constructed than the D7100, and several key camera functions are quicker and easier to set than on the D7100 (i.e., AF mode, metering, ISO, white balance).

I was sick of low light performance by my previous cameras (grainy pictures, slow shutter response, basically worthless performance).  First evening I had the D7100 I went out in the fading twilight and shot in a nearby public garden (the camera was set on Auto and with no flash).  The pictures were superb.  The shutter response was instantaneous.  The camera took soft autumn colors that my eyes no longer could see in the twilight.  Later, inside, I shot a test picture in a dark room with just a bit of light coming in through an open door behind me.  My eyes could only see the vaguest of shapes of furniture and walls.  The camera took a picture mostly in grey tones that showed all the objects in the room clearly.  Again it was set on Auto with no flash so I didn't have to do anything complicated to get the result.  The most interesting thing is the room has a wall hanging that is red and the picture showed the wall hanging clearly red.

You can also adjust sharpening, contrast, brightness, and saturation in the camera under Picture Control on the Shooting Menu. Good for people that don't have post processing software like Lightroom or Photoshop. At the time of this review Lightroom and Photoshop are unable to import RAW NEF files. If you want to work on these files you have to install the View NX software that comes with the camera. Then you can import into that program and save as a TIF file. You can then import TIF files into Lightroom or Photoshop. Hopefully Adobe will release an upgrade soon to offer support for the Nikon D7100.I mostly take snapshots of my dogs or when traveling to post on Facebook so retouching in the camera is what works for me. I purchased the WU-1a wireless mobile adapter to streamline getting the pictures from my camera to Facebook. It wirelessly transfers pictures from the camera to my smartphone or tablet. Once the pictures are on the smartphone or tablet they can be uploaded to Facebook or emailed etc. Super easy way to get pictures from the camera to your cell phone or tablet.I like that it uses SD cards (my previous camera used CF cards) and there are 2 slots for 2 cards. There are 3 different options on how to use the 2 cards. 1) first card for RAW and second for JPEG, 2) second card is used as a duplicate of the first, 3) second card is used for overflow if the first card gets filled up. My laptop has a built-in SD card reader so I don't have to use an external USB card reader to transfer my pictures.Several people have mentioned how the camera searches for focus. I had this same problem and figured out how to change the setting so that didn't happen. Look for the little switch on the front of the camera to switch from AF / M. Leave it on AF, push the button on the switch then turn the command dial to AF-S and then turn the sub-command dial to S. When it's in Auto is when it constantly hunts for focus.The main reason I upgraded to this camera is because the technology is 6 years newer than my old camera and I wanted more megapixels, sharper pictures, better color and less noise. This camera delivers on all counts.I love this camera and can't wait to learn what all its capable of. I gave it 4 stars instead of 5 because no camera is perfect for all things.

I was ruining more shots than I was keeping.  Positioning myself to capture great sports action only to be thoroughly disappointed with focus points everywhere but where I wanted.  I researched and experimented with every setting and lens combo I could muster to correct my issues. Constant disappointment every time. Controlled situations were fine on my D7000. Love the color, handling and creativity. And I have good results with good light, stills, general shooting.  I will send it to Nikon for a checkup. But - I was done with our love affair and considered another body to snuggle with. Then I bought a Nikon D7100. Things changed overnight. I felt younger. I looked better. I was happy. The sun shined everyday. My pictures look great. No, change that to fantastic. I am constantly shooting events in crappy light and not by choice. It is where the work is.

When focusing on distant objects, autofocus, in any mode would indicate correct focus when in fact it was \"front focused\".  The other defect was \"oil on sensor\". If I hadn't already been scrutinizing my images due to the focus problem, I may have missed this second issue. A series of translucent artifacts could be seen in each image. These will only be noticed in untextured, brightly lit areas of the image (like a cloudless sky). Unlike most dust seen on sensors, this is a permanent mark.* The dust removal feature, which normally works very well, does not remove these marks. Further, from reading forums it would appear home sensor cleaning also fails to remove them.Nikon support was disappointing. It seemed while discussing the issue with the technicians that they were unfamiliar with the camera. The most basic question left me on hold while they \"researched\" subjects that should have been part of their daily lexicon. Even discussing my issues with a technical supervisor I found he knew little respecting autofocus fine tuning as one example. In the end they would do nothing for me. It was clear the camera wasn't focusing and that there was spotting on the sensor. Days were wasted while they quizzed me on my knowledge of basic camera operation, suggested I was at fault, sent links to tutorials on basic usage, and sending me into the field to perform pointless tests. It was clear from first contact with them,  the camera would only have to go back for repair anyhow.Nikon has no satisfaction assurance program and provides little more than an answering service for support purposes.Now the good news! Amazon was fantastic! After ten days of frustration with Nikon, one chat session with Amazon (Hazel H.) and I had the option of a full refund or replacement. I was very excited about the D7100 and most certainly wanted another! Amazon had a brand new camera cross shipped overnight air. I called late Friday and had a new camera the next afternoon! WOW, Nikon could learn a thing or two about customer service from Amazon!The new D7100 works very well, I am very pleased with camera. What you can take from this review is there is some chance you may get a lemon. But, after a week in the field with the new camera  I feel it would be worth it (even if you have to get another sent to you). Just do yourself a favor, order it here on Amazon, and deal with them if needs to be returned. There's no one home at Nikon!*New information since originally reviewed -It is a small point, but after exhaustive research I have been convinced by experts in the field that \"Nikon oil spots\" can be removed with home cleaning methods. I stated earlier in this review that these spots were permanent and the problem could only remedied by Nikon themselves. This is simply not the case and I apologize for any inconvenience that this inaccuracy may have caused. However, I still feel that your \"out of the box\" experience should be better. Nikon could be more responsive (and sympathetic) to their customers and there should not be any oil flying around inside this camera! It is frustrating enough to have sensor cleaning issues due to dust that migrates onto the sensor during lens changes. But to have a built in filth dispenser mucking it up is unforgivable. I have, given Nikon's poor customer service, and the fact that my new D7100 already has a number of oily spots on the sensor, decided to lower my rating to three stars.

Image quality is great, with very little loss of detail even at quite high ISO's (I'd make a big print at 6400 without any shame). The 24MP sensor captures a huge amount of detail, suitable for cropping if you don't have a long enough lens when shooting wildlife, but you'll need good technique (and good lenses) to get the most out of it. The amount of detail sucked in by this sensor with good glass at low and moderate ISO is really nothing short of amazing; you can crop half the image off and still have enough pixels left over to make a 300DPI 14x11 print. The flexibility in post-processing on the RAW files is fantastic.The AF system is quite surefooted; along with the AF-S 80-400, it will even track flying swallows.

Don't know whether this is the lens or the camera's fault.)The viewfinder's nice and clear, the ergonomics are pretty good, the imaging is fantastic -- it's a winner. No, it's not FX. But that doesn't matter for most uses; if you need better low light performance, get a fast prime like the 35/1.8 or 50/1.8.

With the exception of the D7000 (I have not 'tested' my D600 yet), EACH camera has had an AF issue; that issue being a front-focus problem. The D5000 has no internal AF fine-tune, so I sent that in for calibration. The D700 I have set on +16, and now the D7100 set on +12. As I mentioned, I haven't 'tested' the D600 yet, but it appears from general shooting the AF is ok. My D7000 has been the only body that is spot-on AF so far.Let me ask you, what is the single most important element needed for taking good, sharp photos? That's right - the focus. It doesn't matter how good your equipment or your technique is if you can't nail exact focus - your photos will be sub-par. With that said, why doesn't Nikon pay extra special attention to this? If I'm paying $1,000-2,000 for a piece of equipment - I want the most important element dead-on.There are many sophisticated items available to check your AF, but here's a simple quick-check that I do:--------------------------------------------------------------**Set your camera up on a tripod**Get out a tape ruler and place it on the floor in front of the camera (I use a Stanley 25 foot)**Set your camera/lens to it's lowest number f-stop (test with different lenses - some may be in the lens only)**Set your AF to single-point and  set your focus to AF-S mode**Focus in on the nearest foot mark to the camera - take a photo**Repeat on next, farther foot mark - work your way out  a few feet (5-10 photos or so)**Check the photos on your computer - zoom in.--------------------------------------------------------------As you review the photos, if your AF is dead-on, the numbers and marks in front of and in back of your reference point (foot mark you were focused on) should be equally in focus and gradually equally blurring in proportion to the distance from your AF point. If they aren't - you need adjustment. Now I know this isn't a dead-accurate focus test, but it will give you a general idea.And note, I didn't begin this testing because I was looking for focus problems. After I noticed numerous photos were not \"perfect\", in certain cameras, I decided to do some testing - this is why I haven't tested the D600 yet - all appears to be OK with that one. Also note, I have tested the bodies with multiple lenses - the problem is in the bodies of the camera.Anyhow, I hope this information helps you create better images.*********The 3 stars is based on the AF issue only***********, otherwise the D7100 seems like a very nice camera so far.", "Date": "December 28, 2013"}, {"Title": "One very dynamic crop sensor camera !", "Author": "Darren G Castellano", "ReviewID": "R2I81J45WQRM97", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I never thought I could get this kind of performance with a DX crop sensored camera !

I don't shoot video so this review may not be for you ?  I was contemplating switching to a full frame body like a D700 or an D 800e.

I was getting ready to sell all my DX equipment on eBay when a friend recommend I shoot with his 7100 for an afternoon before I abandoned my superior collection of DX lenses ! Boy am I happy I took him up on that offer ! I was stunned at the quality of the photos I took with his D7100. The dynamic range and sharpness of the photos I took were absolutly fantastic ! I wasted no time ordering one of my own and since I received it I've been stunned at how big of a difference there is between my D300s and the D7100 !

If you have the money and you really want to invest some time learning the art I think this is probably the best choice.  Excellent build quality, ISO performance, shutter speed, sharpness with the filter less sensor etc.  Some of what turns many new photographers off is the inability to take great photos and camera with the capability of the 7100 helps a great deal.

The price, focal point coverage across the sensor, number of focal points, and size and weight  of the D610 were always on my negatives list.I'm not a fan of megapixel wars, and would give up pixels for better noise performance or better over-all image quality.  Comparing high and normal ISO images, I could see the D7100 beat my D300 and came very close to the D610.  I tested actual raw/NEF images from each camera and found that the D7100 images cleaned up very nicely with my current work flow (I'm now using Adobe Creative Cloud).  So, image quality to me was better than what I currently had and very close to the more expensive D610.The inclusion of the 18-140 lens for a fraction of it's typical $600 was very pleasing.  I used the Nikon 18-135 as my general use lens and loved it, this version with VR is promising to be even better.  The only downside I saw was the FramesPerSecond that couldn't keep up with my old D300 when used with my battery grip.In general, the machine-gun approach isn't practical for me for more than a second anyway.  But it is handy.  Believe it or not, one trick I used to set people at ease is to shout out \"Work with me!\" and blast out rapid shots.  They realizing I'm having fun with them, smile, and I get that one good candid shot.I decided that I like the 1.3x crop feature for the speed benefits and shooting 7fps in JPG cropped mode will probably do me well enough.I doubt I will ever use the scenes, effects, or even video, because it's just not what I do.  But, it takes great images and I have used ISO upto 6400 without problems (in my D300 I would never go above 3200).  Combined with the 18-140, I am very pleased and expect many years of service from the camera.UPDATE:I wanted to add one note regarding the Frames Per Second burst rate: I had a Sony 40ms 16G SDHC card, a SanDisk Extreme 16G card, and purchased a SanDisk Extreme Pro 32G.  I did a test to see how many RAW/NEF images I could shoot in 5 seconds (that seemed like more than my typical burst length).  Each card shot about 6FPS until the buffer filled up, then you could hear the lag as the buffer was written.  In the end, the Sony averaged 12 shots in 5 seconds, the SanDisk Extreme averaged 17, and the SanDisk Extreme Pro averaged 25 shots.  Getting about 5fps on average works fine for me.  So with a really fast ExtemePro card I can see a difference and I'm pleased.

The 51 point AF system is a dream. Its accurate and can be navigated quickly. Being able to hit the \"OK\" button to return back to center AF point is also a plus. When taking photos you can use the \"OK\" button to very quickly check focus and then the command wheels to scrub through faces. Its speeds up the process so much.As for the files I have not even bothered with jpeg, shooting in RAW the whole time. Thus far the images are crisp and clear. I have no problems with the lack of AA filter. On the contrary the images coming from my lens are sharp as a tack! I shoot with Sigma and Nikon and have had no problems with lens compatibility, back focus or front focus.I have shot a few weddings with it since buying the camera. The battery life is a little shorter but I had back up batteries ready (as you always should) and was able to swap out only one time in the shoot. To resolve the problem I am going to pick up the grip soon. But keep in mind that I was shooting a wedding and was firing off lots of images. If you are a weekend warrior the battery life is more than enough.The back LCD screen is clear and big. It lacks the typical cover that Nikon usually places on them, and there is no real indication of why. Or even if the new screen is gorilla glass or what. So far I have no scratches but its still very new. This is not a deal breaker but an odd break from the traditional.Button layout is typical Nikon. I do like that they have modified from the D7000 and now mirror the D600. Its very easy to have a D600 as a primary shooter and use the D7100 as a wonderful second camera body.1.3 crop is the best thing you never knew you didn't have. i find myself reaching for it all the time. Take my 70-200 lens. While its a bit of a pain to figure out the focal length just bear with me. The normal crop factor for the camera is 1.5 (DX) then you can crop down again to the 1.3. The takes the (200mm) x (1.5) x (1.3) = 390mm. The easy way to remember this is almost double your focal length with in crop mode. So a nifty 50mm becomes a 97.5mm and so on. The cost for this is that you go from 24MP down to 16MP. While you will have to weigh out this cost on your own terms, I can tell you that i could care less. For what I shoot and my clients 16MP is just fine. A D7000 is my second body anyway. :) But the ability to instantly grab a little more zoom pays off in dividends of shots not missed and gear not having to be carried.Speed is enough for me. The larger image size (24MP) means that your burst can suffer. I was shooting a large wedding and as they walked back up toward me I started to fill the buffer. It was not a huge deal and didn't stop me from getting all the shots but coming from my D7000 and D600 I was spoiled being able to rattle off shots. Again after I established my limit I was able to stay in it and didn't have the problem any more. But if you shoot fast then you will want to take that into consideration.The video is good. if you crop down you can shoot in 60 FPS. mehh. I will be honest. this is not something I use a lot. I bought my Nikon to take photos and some times I will shoot short video clips but these are rare and often not good enough to make it into a final presentation for a client. You can't change the f/stop when in live view mode which is kind of weird and people are saying it should be corrected in a future firmware update. So far its been a mehh thing for me.There is a lot more I could go on about with the camera. But this is turning into a book. Overall there are some shortcoming with the file speed and ability to quickly modify your settings in live view but for the cost, you will not find a better deal.

Last year I purchased a Nikon D7100, and immediately fell in love with it. The D7100 is a brilliant 24.1Mp powerhouse that can cover both the basics, to the more advanced camera functions.The shutter speeds span an impressive range, from Bulb to 1/8000.  The camera's lowest and highest standard ISO's are 100, and 6,000, but Nikon also has built in high range ISO sensitivities, which can max out at 25,600. The meter features a 2,016 pixel RBG sensor, which does an excellent job for exposure metering.The camera has plenty of uses for both experienced and novice photographers.  In my experience with the camera, it has always been best to run the camera on full manual control, unless dealing with active motion shots, such as you would find in sports.As with most dSLR's, there is a level of fall-off for novice photographers, and while this camera shoots well on auto-features, using the camera's adjustable functions will always provide a better picture. One of the other reasons to shoot in full-manual, is that the auto-focus speed is rather slow. If you will be shooting faster shots, using the auto-focus to set the initial focus is alright, but then its best to turn that off so you can maintain a fast shooting speed.This camera's ISO allows it to deal with dark rooms quite well; attaching it with a very low aperture lens, you can essentially take a picture in absolute darkness.The camera is also capable of shooting in 1080HD. The video function allows you to film while also taking stills, a useful feature if you need to check focus, or capture stills to reduce post production work. The downside to filming with the camera, is that the built in microphone is not the strongest receiver. The sound that it records is usually too quiet, and not of the best quality. If you do want to film sound, I suggest attaching a separate, more powerful mic to the camera's easy to reach port.As a nature photographer, I spend a lot of time in the bush without a tripod. The camera is pretty robust, but that also means that it's heavy (about 3lbs with a lens). It can be uncomfortable to hold at odd angles for long periods of time. I like the size and weight, but for someone just stepping into the world of dSLR's, this is something to stay mindful of.The lens (the 18-105mm f/3.5-5.6 AF-S DX VR ED Nikkor Lens), is alright for what it's worth. A good starter lens, but the thing surely isn't perfect. The aperture doesn't go as low as I would like, and the auto-focus is, as I mentioned earlier, a little slow. A good lens will usually cost more than the camera itself, which is why for a start into the world of SLR's, the accompanying Nikkor lens will do until you get your feet wet.The  +/- function on the camera are a little confusing, as they are reversed in comparison to previous models. I have been using this camera for over a year now, and I still haven't gotten used to it.A disappointing aspect of the camera that I have noticed, is that the monitor does not do a great job expressing the actual lighting and contrast of a photograph. Often the pictures will appear lighter than they actually are, which can result in some frustrating post-production work.I can't speak for much post-production (which effectively cuts me out of RAW), as I tend to dislike the need for heavy editing. I have little to no experience with Photoshop, and most of my touch-up is done in GIMP. This dislike of post-production work has led me to make great use of the camera's dual memory card storage, which is nice to stuff with a couple of 32g cards and never worry about running out of space.Overall, the camera is an impressive piece of equipment, and I have enjoyed the upgrade from my old p90. Having so many controllable functions means that the camera's shooting capabilities will last much longer, as one progressively learns more about photography. While I wouldn't recommend this camera to someone who has no experience with manual photography, it is an excellent step into the world of digital SLRs.", "Date": "April 22, 2014"}, {"Title": "The Best Cropped-Sensor DSLR", "Author": "Hallie", "ReviewID": "R1ZVMUJUGF9Q2J", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "Hands down, I am so happy that I upgraded to the D7100. After shooting landscapes, portraits, macro, wildlife, sports, etc. for a while with the D5100, I knew it was time for an upgrade - and the D7100 fit exactly what I wanted. It features several upgrades from Nikon's entry-level line, from weather-sealing to the dual SD slots. Its button layout is so much more convenient and faster than having to go through menus to adjust settings. Also, even though my hands are small, I greatly enjoy the bigger, sturdier D7100, even with a grip attached (in fact, I have yet to attach the neck strap to it - it feels so good in my hands that I never worry about dropping it).The one downside I've found to this camera is that I had to invest in a few more 16GB memory cards. ;) But on the other hand, I actually prefer it that way - it's nice to have some wiggle room to crop in post in case I didn't frame the subject perfectly.I went back and forth for a while about whether to get the D7100 or the D600, but I could not convince myself to go full-frame just yet.

It's delivery was announced by a thud on my cement landing and the noise of a mail truck speeding away. No problem I thought, with a sturdy box and plenty of bubble wrap, the camera didn't feel anything. Or did it? The small rectangular box was torn open on one end revealing a single piece of bubble wrap loosely lodged in the outer box end opposite of the square inner Nikon box. There was no padding at all around the Nikon box itself. The fact that the camera initially passed all function tests that I put it through is a testament to its solid build. But what's the deal; was the Amazon packer drunk? I don't know.But the camera is extremely customizable, solid and a mean video tool that might even exceed D800 video. The 60i option is very smooth for movement, no noticeable strobing and it may mitigate some of the normal rolling shutter issues - still testing. One needs to allow for a more wide-angle lens for video shooting if in the 1.3X mode (the only mode that allows 60i), even though it is true 1080, you are effectively cropping in on the scene. I find the selectable single point auto focus to be almost as smooth as manual focus, the other high tech focus modes in LiveView have way too much searching focus action. Nothing screams \"home video\" like watching a video where the camera is zooming in and out of focus as it brackets to find the sharpest image - thankfully you don't get that in the single point mode. One half push of the shutter release and it locks the focus on that point, if you want to shift focus, you can move the focus box to the next point without altering the video until you half-push on the new point. Shift! I like it. Still testing the still image functionality but it certainly beats my old D90, sharpness, noise, larger image viewer - a long list. At this price point, you can't go wrong with this level of function.

User Interface.  G12 minimized the need to dig through menus will all of its dials & buttons.  Canon goofed when they didn't do that with their APS-C sensor cameras.  Want buttons & dials?  D7100 or some of the Pentax DSLRs, but the later is weak on lens selection.  (Want the Tamron 150-600 long telephoto lens.  Too bad if you have a Pentax camera.)Any DSLR, just by having a larger sensor, will have better image quality than an advanced P&S; (also have the Olympus XZ-1), so why else should you select the D7100 over another DSLR?  Full-size optical view finder: See all of your composition, aperture, shutter time, exposure, focus point(s), and if in-focus indicator if you are focusing manually.  Plus much less power consumption vs. the Live View on the LCD. Amazing how few DSLRs have a full-size OVF.  And you can use it to compose w. the camera turned off.Other pros: Weather-resistant & great Live View on a large LCD display.

OVF rocks for that snowy owl taking off, because its fast response time.Pictures are @ ISO 6400; even ISO 25,400 is not bad.

Both were intended for outdoors, but the later does well indoors without the flash.  Landscapes are my favorite topic, but have used to the 70-200 to photograph birds.  96%+ shots are with either the monopod or tripod.  Always shoot in PASM to create raw files (never .JPGs) processed by DXO Optics Pro; 'A' & 'M' over 98% of the time.

OVF has an optimum MF indicator; would be nice if Live View had the same.  BIG ONE is the tiny buffer, which fills fast ... shooting smaller formats such as .JPGs helps, as does 1.3 crop mode, as well as a fast memory card (e.g. Sandisk Extreme Pro).Not for everyone: Shines would you take the time & getting the settings right, but a lower resolution P&S; can do better in a pinch.Recommended accessories: Sandisk Extreme Pro memory cards, extra battery, Lenspen, microfiber cloths, rocket blower, good how-to book (Mastering the Nikon D7100, and great lens.

This has been particularly noticeable in the amount of shadow detail I'm able to pull out from RAW photos.* Higher ISO settings are handled well, with less visible noise.  The noise is also finer grained, so there's less loss of detail, and it cleans up quite well in DxO.* The display is nicer.* Auto-focus is significantly improved with many additional auto-focus points, a button to allow you to control AF behavior with the command dials (instead of having to dive into menus), more control over the dynamic auto-focus modes (such as selecting the number of points to use), and the center auto-focus point functions down to f/8.* There's no low pass filter, which provides for finer detail in photos.

The only downsides are that it's a bit heavier than entry level DSLRs and the buffer is small (and, obviously, it's not FX).The custom settings C1 and C2 are really useful for rapidly changing between settings.  When I'm shooting birds or other fast wildlife I'll use the smaller 12-bit lossy RAW files so it's nice to use these to rapidly change between 14-bit lossless and 12-bit lossy.  The customizable menu is great for things you regularly want to be able to change without navigating the gigantic number of options.The continuous burst mode is great for short periods but because the buffer is relatively small, if you do this regularly it's going to be worth getting a couple of SD cards that can write at at least 60MBps.  Note that the camera cannot write to the two SD slots at the same time, so if you set it to backup mode then the effective write speed will be halved.Nikon significantly upgraded it's Auto ISO feature so now it factors in the focal length when determining the appropriate minimum shutter speed for each shot, so if you haven't used Auto ISO before, it's worth checking out again.The battery lasts nearly twice as long (950 shots) as those than smaller DSLRs (typically 550 shots) and over three times as long as compacts (typically 300 shots).  Obviously, I find these numbers vary depending on how much I have the screen on, etc.If you're comparing this to a more modern camera, this paragraph might not mean much to you, but compared to my old D40, the self-cleaning system is amazing and having a built-in intervalometer and an additional port to connect to my smartphone running TriggerTrap opens the door to lots of time-lapse possibilities.

I am not a professional by any means, just a hobby-amateur photographer who wants decent quality photos.  I am also not a pixel counter or zoom in umpteen % like others seem to do.  I like some control to learn and further my ability but also appreciate the auto/scene modes.  That said, this is an excellent camera and in my opinion a good value given the build with weather sealing. I chose the body only and tested it so far with the 16-85mm lens I already have. The few tests I have done have produced excellent images but I have not enough video yet. The locking dial did take a little getting used to but I guess it has its advantage. I'm sure I will learn to appreciate all the control buttons/dials. The screen resolution is outstanding.  A touch screen would be nice to navigate the menu options but not critical for me.  I had the D5200 for a week but ended up sending it back, not due to quality but the fact that it was sent as new and had obviously been used. After much self-debating, I decided to go a step up with the D7100, and glad I did. The shutter noise seems to be quieter, which I like. I am not a fan of the articulating screen so not having that isn't an issue, but may be for some. It is heavier but that would be expected with the better build. There is no comparison in the build quality between the 5200 and 7100, although I found the 5200 to be exceptional in image quality too!  I like that you can have two SD cards in the camera to have one exclusively for video or backup/overflow. I know I have some learning to do so may update this review at a later date.

Case in point: 51 AF points. Coming from the D90, where I had 11, this seemed to be a really good thing, and it CAN be, in the right scenario. However, if you blindly set it to use 3D tracking without considering your subject, the sheer density of the focus points combined with certain subjects can lead to a lot of focus-shifting back and forth. The solution to this is to either use pure auto focus (and I know you purists are shaking your head already at that one, I know I was at first), change the AF mode to AF-S, or use less focus points. I suspect if I had just left the focus as it shipped, I wouldn't have seen any issue at all.Much of what is new to me, like the custom modes, won't be new to somebody coming from the D7000, so I won't go into detail on those. It does feel that this has become the definitive DX camera to track action - sports and wildlife in particular, given the new crop mode (which is of no use to me) and the aggressive focus tracking. But there's plenty in there for other shooters as well, and the extra resolution and light sensitivity is never a bad thing.", "Date": "January 10, 2014"}, {"Title": "Fantastic Package", "Author": "Trooper", "ReviewID": "RTH6M7EVDS7K9", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "Just to start off with, this camera is fantastic! I had been using the Canon 1100D since Christmas 2011, and bought this in July 2013 after I had come to the conclusion I had pushed the limitations of the 1100D too far, and wanted an upgrade.At first I was looking at the Canon 6D, then D600 and then came onto this new D7100 whilst doing my research. I was at the time just documentating my Year with photos and videos, however, I found that the 1100D, no matter how trusty that thing was, couldn't keep up with the parties, low-light concerts, sports, however, it did do the job. So these were the things I was looking for in the camera.One of the grabbing selling points of the camera was the 51 Auto-Focus points and the \"1.3x Crop Mode\" along with the potential of 7fps (in crop mode). However, when I finally got the camera, I realised I only really used the center focus point. But coming from the sub-par low light 1100D, this focus point is all that is needed. I am able to focus in near pitch black with the kit lens (18-105mm f/3.5-5.6) and it would be in focus. This is even without the focus assist light, which for me is now redundant (but I do keep it in my own menu, in case I do actually need it). No more missing shots, because people think that the \"focus-assist flash\" on the 1100D was actually the photo.I am more than comfortable in pushing ISO up around the 3200 mark without needing to worry about heavy noise reduction as well, especially if you can't use a flash, however I would highly recommend good glass (even if I don't have any yet, I'm planning on it). If you are thinking about extreme low-light videography (since VR, VC, OS won't do much to reduce shutter speed for video), the new \"Sigma 18-35mm 1.8\" and this camera would be one amazing wide-angle zoom combination on a budget, especially if you can't 'quite' afford a D4 with 24mm f/1.4.For sports, which is something I like photographing, and now want to get into wildlife, this is where the 51 AF points come into their own. I always use the crop factor for sports, and though other reviewers \"chop\" off body parts or miss bits because of it, it's mostly because it does take some time getting used to it. In the crop mode, the 51 AF points literally cover the whole frame, apart from the top and bottom, which would only be able to fit another line of AF points in anyway. I'm not too familiar with the Dynamic 51 points and so I'm still getting used to it, but in the meantime the 3D Tracking mode seems to do the job pretty nicely.This camera has astounded me in many ways, however there are a couple of things I would like to point out.1. There seems to be more noise than there should be even at low ISO's (400, 800) - not too much of a problem, noise reduction + good glass.2. Can't change aperture in Live-View, especially a pain if you changing apertures whilst switching between photo and video modes.I can easily turn a blind eye when you look at the camera holistically. You get an amazing package for the prize, and have already taken close to 20,000 photos in about 4 months.Though I highly recommend getting this camera, do be realistic when considering what camera to buy. The D5200 will do pretty much everything this will do, albeit just not quite as good, or have the controls, but image quality (the big thing at the end of the day) is basically the same. And then you can spend that money saved either on better glass or even a little holiday somewhere. On a slightly more exaggerated level, though you may be able to take some very nice shots in your backyard, the person that went to France who got a slightly lesser camera and gear, will still have nicer pictures and memories.", "Date": "November 11, 2013"}, {"Title": "love this camera, fantastic performance", "Author": "Amazon Customer", "ReviewID": "R1LZFDT3QMVLGR", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I have nothing but positive things to say about this great camera.

Still quality is great, though not as much of an improvement over the D7000 as one might think... yes, pixel count is higher and the lack of an anti-aliasing filter does make the images strikingly crisp, but it may also be a tiny bit noisier at high ISO in low light (compared to the D7000).  Nikon added a few video modes (like 1920x1080 30fps, as well as 60fps modes) but dropped 1280x720 30fps.  Video overall is far easier to use... there are now record level meters visible on the LCD and you can adjust levels as you're recording.  HDMI output resolution is adjustable, which has made the response time a little faster with the LILLIPUT 665GL-70NP/HO/Y/P field monitor when starting up or switching from record to playback... those delays haven't gone away completely but it's not as bad as it was with the D7000.

The D800 will give you 15 megapixels out of 1.5x crop, where as the D4 will give you 12 megapixels at one 1.5x crop. The D7100 is already a 1.5x times crop and is 24 megapixels. Not only that but when you go into 1.3x crop mode on this camera it will give you an effective focal range of 1.9x crop.What this means is on a D800E if you have a 70-200mm lens your focal range would be 300mm at 15 megapixels, with the D4 you would have 300mm at 12.1 megapixels. With the D 7100 you would have 400mm at 16.2 megapixels.

I tried the D7000 and made numerous comparisons with other camera brands, but for the money and name, you can't go wrong with the D7100. The added \"reach\" of the additional crop factor (1:3), and the huge new (3.2 in.) display screen give this entry an extra boost above the competition. Added to this the 14 bit RAW file at 24.1 MP and you've got a winner for DX shooting that really deserves to be called \"Nikon's DX Flagship\" in this format; a post-processing Lightroom dream to work with.Right out of the box, Nikon presents itself with distinction; this thing exudes quality and comfort. Factory defaults were right on and presented great pictures instantly. The fast 51 point auto-focusing system with the 15 cross-types really do the job and I was amazed at the speed, even when using a slow and heavy Nikkor 55-300mm lens- see flower shots in customer images.I have been waiting for this model even before it was announced; almost three years now and I'm not disappointed. It would seem that the earlier problems with front/back focusing in some D7000's have been addressed and corrected with this one, as I see very few problems of this sort. I find it amusing that some users forget to adjust the diopter in the viewfinder to their own specific eye needs; each person is slightly different. That should be emphasized in the opening instructions in capital and bold letters, so that everyone gets it \"right.\" Without that, manual focusing will be to all practical purposes impossible.When you get your new camera delivered, there are some important steps to take to insure everything goes the way it should.Carefully unpack your shipment box, taking care to hang onto the original packaging materials in case you are returning it.Charge battery to full charge. Don't fall for the temptation to fiddle with the settings on the camera with a partially charged battery.CHECK VIEWFINDER DIOPTER with lens attached to correct for your shooting eye. Then double check its accuracy.When SD cards are inserted, format them in the camera to acclimate them to the file system. Never format any camera card in your computer. In fact, when copying from card, don't cut and paste any image from the card, just copy and paste. Don't let the computer treat the card as an external hard drive and modify it, use importing software or simply copy and paste files into your picture directory.Start at factory (out-of the box) settings and take some shots. Remember any modifications can be undone by simple formatting the camera back to factory default by pressing and holding the two green buttons on the outside of the camera for two seconds.And lastly, remember that this is a virtual visual computer with a huge array of functions and capabilities that will take some time to understand and learn.

Using best glass (Nikon 35-70 F2.8, Nikon 80-200 F2.8D), I see more improvement of this camera (compared to anything else). You really need a better glass to see the resolving power of this sensor.2. I would say, the combination of the new sensor (Toshiba) and the removal of Anti-aliasing Filter, make this beast a really good performer in terms of image quality.3. The 1.3 crop factor is really a handy nice to have feature, because I am now only use 3X F2.8 zoom lens (for the sake of maximum Image Quality). And it really helps when I need more reach/close up and don't bother to change lens.4. I noticed that the performance of AF sensor is much improved over D7000. I am getting more success ratio using the non cross type AF spot than I use to have with D7000 (For this reason, I only use the center AF spot and recompose technique in D7000 to avoid Focus error).5. The AF performance in low-light is also improved over D7000, not significantly, but enough to be noticed.6. With the 1.3 crop factor, my favorite portrait lens now is the old (but still very good) 35-70 mm F2.8 D. It even give much better result than the new 50mm F1.4 G.===========================Original Review start here:===========================I use D7000, and jump to D7100 when it is available, for one reason: Video Shooting! It has (that D7000 doesn't): Audio Meter, Headphone Jack, Stereo Mic, 50i/60i at full HD (1920X1080).But after use it for several weeks, this is additional things that I found useful:1. 1.3 crop. This is amazing feature that I use more and more often now. Especially when using my Nikon 50mm F.14G, and Tokina 11-16mm F2.8. I program the Image Area (1.3X 18Mp or DX 24mp), into Fn button, so I can switch them without leaving my eye from viewfinder. Why I need this? To make my 50mm lens become 65mm lens. Or making my 11-16mm become 14-20mm. Fantastic...! Now my Tokina 11-16mm becoming more 'portrait' friendly.2. Auto-focus. No surprise, the auto-focus is much better than D7000. It is more consistent, and little bit faster. And also perform slightly better in low light.3. 24Mpix. This is actually has a mixed result. On 24Mpix (DX Image Area, see point 1), it becomes noticeably slower (I always shoot RAW uncompressed + Jpeg Fine). On the other hand, at 18Mpix (1.3 Crop) it is snappier and comparable to D7000 in terms of speed/response.4. Image quality: I find it a little bit better than D7000, but not really impressing like jumping from D100 to D200, or D200 to D300, or D300 to D3S.The cons:At 24Mpix (DX mode), it becomes slower. And when I need to preview the Image, it take some times to response (not like D7000 which is snap). I don't have a chance to test it with fastest SD card (90MB/s). I only use SanDisk Extreme 45MB/s. Probably, when I use a 90MB/s SD card, and split NEF in slot 1 and JPG in slot 2, the response will be much faster.Conclusion:For me, it is a really worth the upgrade, but probably not applicable to any other person with different requirement.", "Date": "May 18, 2013"}, {"Title": "Nikon D7100", "Author": "Squizzy", "ReviewID": "R1ARPN2PITMXR7", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "The camera arrived in two days from the seller and I blown away with the quality of the photos I've taken.

I have been dithering for quite a while and have a hodge podge of Nikon lenses. FX lenses include the 24-70mm f/2.8, 70-200mm f/4.0, and a TC-14E II teleconverter. DX lenses include the 10-24mm and the 85mm VR micro. My belief is that DX was the right way to go for me because 1) good DX cameras produce superb photos, 2) I can buy less expensive lenses because the pretend focal lengths are larger, 3) only the sweetest part of FX lenses (their centers) will be used, 4) DX camera bodies will remain less expensive, and 5) my default print size is only 13\"x19\". This introductory paragraph is not to convince you that DX is the right way to go but to explain why I bought this camera instead of a D600 or D800.Let me start by saying that I love this camera! Nikon managed to do a few stupid things that I'll mention below but let's talk about the positives first. The shutter release - including focusing, VR, and metering - is so fast that it's hard to press just half way to lock readings. I'm sure there is some shutter lag but I couldn't measure it. Focus is spot on with all my lenses and I have not used the capability to do individual lens adjustments. Other positives as reported by most other reviewers: camera feel (solid); good controls; sensible blend between menus, buttons, and dials; viewfinder setup and image size; etc.I have read some other reviewers that say this camera isn't very sharp. Not so! If you have moved up from a 10-12 megapixel to this one, you can be fooled as I was. I typically pixel peep in photoshop with the image at 100%, i.e., one picture pixel per one monitor pixel. You are looking at a much smaller piece of real estate in this mode when you have twice as many pixels per unit area and that means that you are looking at smaller, less contrasty details. Remember, manufacturer's MTF curves pretty much measure contrast as an approximation to sharpness. Of course the pictures look \"oh my god\" sharper when you print them since they have twice as many pixels per unit area on paper.I shoot 14-bit raw images with loseless compress and rarely use the 1.3 crop mode though I've mapped crop mode to one of the external buttons. Warning, the full-sized raw files are 25-30 megabytes and that means you can only store about 35 files per gigabyte of hard disk. So make your plans carefully before buying your next large pixel-count camera. Further, photoshop 16-bit psd files from D7100 images take 137MB on disk. I think that I would have bought a less capable camera if I were not shooting raw and running a 16-bit post process. Raw and 16-bit processing are not snobbery, rather they allow me to make up for virtually every type of error at picture-taking time except bad focus, bad subject selection, and excessive camera shake. That for me is the big advantage of digital photography but the D7100 or any other large pixel-count sensor makes you pay in disk storage.Now lets talk briefly about a few snafus. SubjectDistance is a standard Exif parameter and used to be generated in all Nikon DSLR images. ApproximateSubjectDistance is not a standard EXIF parameter but D7100 firmware generates it instead of SubjectDistance! Why is that bad? Three reasons: 1) photoshop will not display the field, 2) ViewNX 2 - Nikon's own software - dosen't display this nonstandard field either, and 3) Nikon support staff will not comment on whether or not either, neither, or both software and firmware will be repaired. The simplest way to recover the information is to load the sidecar file created by photoshop into a text editor and search on \"distance\" and read a fractional number. I can also convert that distance from metric if I like using a pencil or a calculator. Only a diseased mind could cause such nonsense.Another snafu reported by many in these reviews is the smallish memory buffer that limits rapid shooting. Memory is really cheap - I'd guess that for a two dollar bill, four times as much memory could have been included. I almost never use multiple shot modes or bracketing; rather my problem arises when my shutter finger gets itchy. This is a rarely occurring issue but the symptom of an outrageously dumb parting decision.I have rated this camera 5 stars in spite of these silly design flaws. However, I'd pay money to enter a raffle to paddle Nikon suits who impose these decisions. (The other manufacturers are just as lame.) It's a great camera, impressive in so many ways.

Setting up all of the defaults to your individual specifications and designating control functions to specific buttons takes a bit of time initially, but the results make it a great investment of time.Still getting accustomed to the all of the possibilities the camera provides. Combined with the new Nikkor 18-300 lens it is a relatively heavy assembly. Again, worth it in every respect. Nikon can rightly claim this as a flagship DX until they top it with something else in the future.Can't speak for professionals and really advanced enthusiasts, but for the rest of us.

All technical stuff aside, this camera takes incredible pictures.  I spent the afternoon experimenting with several DX lenses and the results were just fantastic.  About an hour before sunset the moon was up in the eastern sky so I slapped on my telephoto and took a shot. I wasn't expecting a lot but when I moved the picture over to my computer and zoomed in on the moon it looked like I took a picture with a telescope!  The lunar landscape was incredibly clear. Beginner or seasoned veteran this camera is a fantastic choice.My first Nikon was a D70 which is still a fantastic camera.  Recently a friend upgraded from a D3100 to a D600 so he cut me a deal on the D3100 which I really enjoyed playing with.  The 3100 is a great starter camera for those looking to ease there way in to the DSLR world.  But having used the D70 for years it felt a bit too light and small for my taste.  If you are hanging on to your D70 or D90 go ahead, make the leap.  The D7100 is a fantastic successor to my D70.", "Date": "March 24, 2013"}, {"Title": "The Best DX Camera Nikon Ever Made", "Author": "Smoothbassman", "ReviewID": "R2OYIINZVYT2VX", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I have only had this camera or a week now, but I have to put in a review because it is just that good!Nikon did an excellent job with this camera.  I have shot about 500 pictures and different events over the last week and the image clarity and detail is superior to the D3100 and D5100 that I have had in the past.  Outside photography is really easy with any camera, so I wanted to do a real comparison to indoor image quality with limited lighting so, I snapped on my 1.8G lens and went inside to shoot an event and I got outstanding results.  The depth of color is amazing and the detail in the images were just amazing.  Removing the low pass filter helps this camera excel in the low light environment excellent move on Nikon's part.  The grain is smaller at identical ISO's compared to the D5100.The camera body is laid out well.  They squared things off in comparison to the D5200 thats out now, and changed the LiveView switch over to a button which I like.  Everything seems to be just in the right place for my hands.  I don't have really large hands so it just works.I did get this camera with the kit lens, since it was immediately available versus the body alone.  I must say that I'm impressed with the kit lens. it only goes down to 3.5G at 18mm which isn't bad but if you want to reach out and grab a shot at 105mm your aperture moves up to 5.5 which requires a shutter speed adjustment or ISO boost to get the shot.  Fortunately adjustments in manual mode are quick and easy since you have 2 quick adjustment dials, and ISO adjustment is right there at your left finger.  I didn't like that the default setting is to see the shot count on the viewfinder versus ISO, but its a quick change in the menu system to make the ISO your default display option.Another awesome feature that was added is the  white balance adjustment.  Now you can frame up your reference shot, shoot a gray card in that scene, select the gray card in live view and make the WB adjustment right there and save that as one of the presets for the shoot.  No more batch editing in Lightroom.  Totally awesome!!The only gripe I have on the camera right now, and its not on the camera itself is that Adobe Lightroom hasn't been updated yet to read the RAW files from this camera.  I can read them in photoshop but thats a 1 by 1 process and I need to get them into Lightroom so I can do some batch processing.  Knowing that shortcoming, I shot RAW+JPEG all week so I could still get them into LR and get the photos out to clients.If you are looking for an excellent camera for DSLR photography and don't want to make the plunge in FX format.  This hands down is the best DX format camera on the market PERIOD.  Don't look anywhere else.UPDATE:  Used the camera to shoot some 1080P video.  In manual mode you have full control over the ISO, fStop, and Shutter Speed.  Having full control over your exposure for video is awesome.  Haven't used a DSLR for video work before, but now I can see why its so popular.  You have easier access and control over everything.  Its even better than my pro HD camcorder that I own.  Can't wait to get outside this spring and see the quality of video with lower ISO's.  Had to shoot between 2000-4000 ISO to get good exposure at 4.5g inside with contrasting light and dark areas in the room I was shooting in.", "Date": "March 24, 2013"}, {"Title": "bad copy?", "Author": "Piotrek Tuszynski", "ReviewID": "R1FWEYTXGDN5LE", "Overall": "3.0", "Content": "I grew up with Zenith 12xp (still have it :), few years back I shot Nikon N70 panorama, recently I decided to go back to the hobby and purchased D7000 + 35mm/f1.8.

When I realized an entry level Nikon DSLR with a kit lens was producing better images than my D-80 with prime lenses I knew it was time to wish my old workhorse a fond farewell.  I will be honest, when the box arrived I was actually a little nervous.  I am nothing more than a hobbyist who dabbles in some portraiture and the odd project, however I do spend a lot of time behind my camera and take considerable pride in my photos.  I was nervous because frankly bells and whistles do not excite me nearly as much as being able to produce a sharp image without much fuss - until the D-80 I was still using my old Contax 139 Quartz and have always been afraid of the technology.  Let me just say - the transition from the D-80 to the D-7100 was a breeze.  No I haven't figured out half of the features on the D-7100 and no I am not interested in half of the features of the D-7100.  What I AM interested in is being able to take photos and adjust shutter speeds, apertures ISO etc without too much trouble.  I have been pleasantly surprised to find that not much has changed - I can still toggle my focal points - now I have 51....yay....I can still compensate exposure values with camera on my face - I can still scroll through shutter speeds and apertures - everything is pretty much the same in those regards - five minutes after the charger said the battery was ready I had my 50mm lens on and was snapping shots of the dog - the exposure meter is twice as accurate as the D-80 and when lighting is tricky the 1/3 step bracketing is a breeze - the real shocker came when I took a look at the images on the big bright screen - tack sharp and noise free - and with the iso set to auto in dim incandescent lighting I was actually realllllly shocked to see that these images were shot in 6400... wow - anything over 800 in the D-80 was almost unusable - this is a treat!  And the white balance was as close to perfect as I have seen - makes me tempted to shoot jpeg for a while and save some fiddling in post. Obviously 6400 is higher than the norm and for photos that find themselves anywhere other than FB or Instagram or in prints will be treated with lighting and lower ISO's - however even at 6400 I have very usable - very sharp images that are more than acceptable for sharing family photos with friends etc.No back focus issues at all - even on the two Tokina lenses I like to use - an 11-16 2.8 and an old 28-80 Pro ATX 2.6 (Angelieux) .  I took the 50mm off and put the 80-200 2.8 on and wow - just wow - I haven't seen images this sharp since the old contax had a CZ parked on the front with custom film processing.  I am actually blown away.I cannot speak for someone who has upgraded every two years when the latest and greatest arrived on the scene - there are likely some nit picky annoyances for folks who have the time to fiddle with every feature.  I can however say that if you hate to let go of an old reliable and have the chance to get the D-7100 body with some decent to high quality glass, you will NOT be disappointed - at all.So, the D-80 got relegated to warming the bench, a great back up for sure, but likely will see very little action... the fact that I parked a crappy old kit lens on the front and stuck it in my storage box should tell the story quite well enough.", "Date": "March 12, 2014"}, {"Title": "Best ever", "Author": "M.

I went from the D3200 which I thought was awesome until I picked up the D7000, and finally ended up with this beautiful piece of machinery here.  The user interface was very different on this camera.  It is not designed for beginners like the D3200.  You will have to read the manual to learn everything that the camera does and so that your not fumbling through settings like a lost child.  First and fore most stepping up to the pentaprism from the penta-mirror was the most obvious change that was noticed.  Second the auto focus just has been snappy great and responsive.  In reference from jumping up from the D7000.  I really got to be able to appreciate the sharpness that I just wasn't seeing in the D7000.  I guess removing that filter actually made things a little bit sharper.  The OLED screen in the back is clearer and just shows you a better representation of what your trying to see.The 7100 has subtle updates that just make a lot of things easier.  The updated pixels add just a little more detail.  The use of HDR is very nice to try out by setting the amount of exposures you would like.  The 7100 does video better as well.  With the addition of the stereo inputs and also the use of the updated wireless adapter it makes using this camera a breeze.  All in all this camera is great to use and very fun to see the images that can be shot so effortlessly.  The ISO performance is also about the same.  Thank you for your time.

This is a camera that can be used by an advanced amateur or someone starting out with photography. I like the internal commander flash so I can fire a remote SB700 flash. The dual SDHC card slots are a good feature as one can fill up and the camera will automatically switch to the one in the other slot or one can be used for photos and the other for video.The new f8 autofocus is great for slower lenses. This camera focuses much faster in low light with my two f5.6 zoom lenses than would the D300s with these lenses. Photographing birds in flight is easy with this camera. There is also a function to show if the camera is tilted either vertically or horizontally and I use this a lot. I have the camera set so the preview button turns this on and off.The body is somewhat on the small side and with large/normal mens hands the controls are more awkward than with the D300s or full size cameras. The optional battery pack would be good for this but it is over $260 and not something I plan to buy at that price.Picture quality is outstanding and I can make 20x30 prints from the files. There are special picture controls so an image can be adjusted in the camera and saved or sent to a printer. A friend shoots with a D800 and the two cameras are more alike that I had realized. The D7100 is a lot like having a D800 crop camera at a third the price of the full frame camera.Exposure accuracy, white balance accuracy, and fill flash accuracy are amazing.

I jumped into the digital world and worked my way back to Nikon with a 995, then a D70 and most currently the D90 until I purchased this D7100.  I am by far not a pro, or even a semi-pro, but just an enthusiast that enjoys taking photos and I like going out of the box and getting away from the Auto or point and shoot modes.After many weeks of swaying back and forth, reading all kinds of user and professional reviews,  I finally made the decision to buy the D7100.  I could not justify going full frame as the cost of the camera and investing all new lenses, was just not realistic.  I don't do large prints that often.  Mostly I do Meetups and just look for one day fun shoots.  So the DX format is more than adequate for me.  Yes, if you are a pro, or advanced semi-pro, you probably should be looking at a full frame model.  But that is overkill for someone like me. Oh if I had more money than I needed, LOL,  maybe then I would have gone full frame!!But this DX D7100 and the Nikon glass I have, I believe will do as much as I need to do with photography, at least for quite some time.  There may be additional glass options I will add to my arsenal but I believe I have the basic body I will be able to use.I have to say, for someone moving up to the D7100 or first time users,  I solidly recommend David Busch's full version of the D7100.  I am about 1/4 through it but it is making the transition from the D90 much smoother and helping me utilize all the features available to me with this model.  I want to avoid the Auto settings where I can and this books is super in my mind.Is the D7100 perfect? No, by no means.  But this it isn't a D4 either, nor the cost of the D4!!

I took test shots of planes flying overhead and in standard auto focus, not the tracking auto focus, the camera tracked the airplane from a good distance and also on approach.If you own the Nikon D5100, the menu is similar and the camera is very easy to set up.As far as in other reviews where people have said they don't like where the buttons are set up, I cannot relate, but where the buttons are, just fine for me.One interesting thing that I liked about the camera is that is has an additional 1.3 crop which can be set up in the camera menu.

While the options this camera provides are a little overwhelming at first, i find great comfort in the ability to take the camera to a fully manual mode for everyday shooting while I adjust. It's funny, because while this is my first DSLR, I feel like I have had this camera much longer than I actually have thanks to the simple and consistent way Nikon lays out their controls, if you have owned a Nikon in the past, you will find the D7100 immediately familiar in many ways.There are plenty of places to review and compare the specs of this camera, so I wont go into them here, but I will tell you what I think is great about this camera.While it may be more camera than some people need, I am a fan of buying the best I can afford and simply grow into it, this saves money over the long term. I don't imagine I will ever need more than the 24 megapixels the D7100 provides.The camera is light but solid with a very well balanced feel, I never feel as though it will slip from my hand and the grip is comfortable, although it may be a bit of a stretch for someone with smaller hands (I am six feet tall with larger hands).The camera is quiet and responsive, the buttons provide solid tactile feedback, you can easily operate the D7100 in the dark. The LCD screen on the back is crisp and bright, it reminds me of the clarity of the retina display on Apple products.Coming from a 35mm film camera (full frame) to a DX (crop sensor) takes a bit of getting used to because the angle of view is much tighter. Even though I educated myself about the differences between full frame and crop, seeing it with your own eyes really drives home how different they really are. For example, I also purchased the AF-S Nikkor 50mm 1.4 G with the body instead of opting for the kit lense and what you see with the 50 mm with a crop sensor on Nikon is equal to a 75 mm lense since nikon uses a crop factor of 1.5 (50 x 1.5= 75). This makes for a tighter frame, definitely not a deal breaker by any means, but it is something you should be keenly aware of since it will affect which lenses you purchase and how you take your photographs.There are so many in camera options for the D7100, I highly recommend you RTFM and keep it with you as it will save you much frustration as you learn the equipment.Here are some of my favorite options:* single frame multiple exposure* exposure bracketing* intervalometer* dual card slotThe only complaint I have is regarding battery life, it's a little too short for me. For example, I went on a photo walk recently and ended up taking about 200 shots, by the time I was done the battery was 3/4 depleted. Admittedly I have no basis for comparison, but it felt as though I was being limited by the battery life instead of my own will. Do yourself a favor and purchase a second battery to carry with you. They are relatively cheap but are infinitely valuable.I have only owned the D7100 for a month now so I have not been able to fully explore all it has to offer like the video capabilities.As I stated before, this will be a great camera to grow into.", "Date": "August 25, 2013"}, {"Title": "its crazy good !", "Author": "whole_e _cow", "ReviewID": "R2VOAUFJUXLV3I", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "so far I ve shoot a few hundred shoots and the picture quality is so good It is hard to believe, my only problem is that I use photoshop and its so new its not supported yet but i'm sure they will get around to including it in their lens profile , heck yes by all means skip the d600 I tried both this works better Royce", "Date": "April 24, 2013"}, {"Title": "DSLR King", "Author": "Neil", "ReviewID": "R3PONMQ41RISP0", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I think Nikon nailed it with this DSLR.

Unless your D90 is broken, don't bother.", "Author": "Elyone", "ReviewID": "R3SXCJPOCDVMDK", "Overall": "3.0", "Content": "I shoot semi-pro (i.e. about 10-12 events a year) and have used the D90 very successfully since literally the first day is was available as body only.  I am a big Nikon fan, ever since my N70.I finally upgraded to the 7100 after reading so many amazing reviews and the feeling that my D90 was aging and I was getting afraid to take responsibility. My back-up is a D70s, so now I use the 7100 with my D90 as backup.1. Yes, the image quality is great. But, I do not see a huge improvement over the D90. And I have some very good glass. Chromatic aberration is bad. Also  24MP is more than 99% of what your images need. I like the idea that the D4s is only 16mp. Far smarter. (Wish I can afford that)2. I love having dual cards. But this is more for peace of mind, than any real improvement in my images.3. Like the U settings, the S C ring and their locks. But again this is not something that directly affects images.However, there are some things, that really bug me as a working photographer.1. The 2 stage shutter button stinks. The D90's is better, even after almost 50k actuations. The 7100's first stage is mushy and not crisp. I keep missing the focus when I need critical focus with f1.4 lenses, because the mushiness makes it harder to feel. So when I think I am in focus lock, and recompose, I am actually NOT in focus lock resulting in the lens continuing to hunt. And so I miss the shot. Fooi. So yes, with practice I am getting better at feeling the exact spot,  but seriously? This is a HUGE flaw. Huge.2. Button placement of Live is bad and far worse than the D90. (I use it to compose  when \"holding the camera up high over my head\"). YMMV.3. The red flaring is useless hard cheap plastic, not the slightly rubbery feel of the D90. Which gives the D90 a slightly better grip. <-- nit pick, I know.4. They moved the + button up 2 spaces. Why, oh why? The first thing you do when you critically examine a photo is to zoom in. So why move the button to a place you need to look at the buttons every time, instead of being to feel the lowest button?5. Ditto regarding the View/Play  button. Why recess it and move it from the top spot?6. The focus spot lock button is not firm enough either.In summary, of course the 7100 is a much more advanced camera. But honestly, I am beginning to regret this purchase. The D90 is still a very very good camera, and if you don't pixel peep,or need 51 focus points it is hard to see the difference with 90% of your photos.

I didn't buy the D7100 hoping for better image quality vs the D5100. Both have similiar image quality and impossible to tell apart. Some said, the D7100's high ISO performance isn't that great vs the D5100. It's actually slightly better, but not by much according to my tests. Keep in mind you're viewing a 24mp vs 16mp too.Tested the D610 before making my choice to go with the D7100. The D610 isn't a  bad camera, but can't stand all the focus points cluttered into a tight space. The D7100 also seem to focus faster too with the same lens (50mm F/1.8).  If i were to go full frame, i would skip directly to the D800's. Personally I think the D7100 is better than the D610 and D700. I do mostly daylight photography, so paying extra $$$ for low light performance isn't worth it and it's not like the D7100 sucks in low light anyway. I get usable/good pictures up to ISO 3200.Only a few thing I don't quite like about this DSLR.****The ISO button cannot be programmed to another button. when using a light lens, it's not so bad, but when using a heavy lens like the 70-200 F/2.8, it's tough.EDIT: 4/9/14 <Dropped 5 stars to 4>After 1000 shots, about 20-30 small spots appeared across the whole frame at F22.

I progressed from D100 to D200, to D300 and finally to this camera which is the \"D400\" if such a thing existed.  The stills are amazing.  Incredibly low noise even at high ISO.  Coupled with a sharp lens, this camera simply makes everything else before it obsolete.  But I still cannot fathom why Nikon simply has no clue about professional video.  If you are looking for a DSLR as a large sensor video camera for \"cinematic look\" video, DO NOT buy this camera.  The quality of the video is simply not there.  I cannot explain why.  There is no explanation except the software because the sensor clearly has far more resolution than is required to make exceptional video, but this camera just doesn't do it.  It's just soft and lousy looking when compared to virtually any other DSLR or even a cheap video camera.  Cranking up the sharpening setting just makes it worse (it looks like soft video that has been sharpened).  The 60i mode is so bad it's unusable.  I'm extremely disappointed in this camera's video quality.  In addition, the pre-amp on the mic input is really noisy, so there is a lot of hiss on interviews even when using premium lav mics.  I give it 4 stars because it's an exceptional still camera and that's what most people will buy it for.  But if you are a filmmaker looking for a DSLR cinema camera, buy a Canon.  I hate to say it, but it's true.  Come on Nikon, you can do so much better.

To top it all off, I was able to time my purchase so amazon was awarding 4% cash back, giving away a camera backpack and a good 32GB sandisk SD card (not the normal generic amazon SD card) so financially it all was a blessing.As for the camera, I came from a D300. The D7100 is very much an upgrade both in image quality and in operation. Menus are intuitive, buttons are close to the D300's so that I didn't have to learn much, but there is a lot of additional functionality that just adds to the operation to make it easier to use and produce more keeper photos.Body is a little lighter and smaller than the D300 so that is actually a blessing since I don't want to lug around all that weight anymore. Everything fits great in my hands.The lens is exactly what I wanted for a walk-around lens. Covers all the focal lengths I normally use and the VRII allows me to get away with the slower apertures. (When I want to do really critical imaging in low light with faster shutter speeds, I still have my 17-55 so all is good.

It was a loyal friend and companion for thousands of pictures, some were mentioned by the editors of National Geographic on their website, others won prizes in a photo magazine. So you see, it performed well and helped me show my creativity.The  D 7000 was a superb camera but has a bigger brother now, the D 7100. The difference is huge in sheer sharpness, clarity and brightness. I was lucky enough to test the 7100 out at the same location, same month, same event and at the same light conditions two years apart. The difference is in quality ( sharpness, light sensitivity and brightness) is truly astounding!Whoever comes from the 7000 will have a very easy time adjusting. Some of the buttons are at different locations, one has to get used to that but one will eventually.The only two things I don't understand is why Nikon made the front dial on the right side slimmer than on the  D7000. The dial on the 7000 stuck out a touch wider and had a better feel to it.And last I have to say there is one thing I think is a bad design on both cameras. I already was bothered by it on the 7000 and can not believe they didn't fix this design flaw with the newer model... it used to happen ALL the time that after I put my camera back in the photo bag, the little compartment in which the memory sticks are slipped open by itself.This should not happen and should be double secured. To make sure this does not happen without me noticing it, I put black tennis (grip) tape over it. It would be a shame to loose memory sticks because of this.But except for this, this is an absolutely brilliant camera for the advanced photographer.

But, most importantly of all (and admittedly subjectively), the sharpness and clarity of the photos seem to exceed any of my previous dSLRs (D2X, D300, D7000) - maybe it's the removal of the anti-aliasing filter, maybe it's the 24 MP, (although I'd like to say it's my technique (not)), but the image quality just is mind blowing. The focusing is faster than the others-I guess due to Expeed 3. The menu system is similar to the D7000: so customizable, it will suit virtually anyone's needs. My only minor complaint is that, with the larger files sizes, the camera's buffer fills after 3 quick shots (in RAW) and one must wait (momentarily) for the camera to write to the card. (I've ordered and await the fastest possible cards and I advise this for all-they're pricey). The 1080 p 30 fps video is stunning.

The jump from the D5200 to the D7100 isn't as dramatic as from the D3200 to the D5200, and possibly the new D5300 is the sweet-spot for value right now, but I am happy with the D7100.It is refreshing to have a lot more settings close at hand, courtesy of the many more physical buttons dedicated to them and the additional control dial.The viewfinder is quite a bit nicer - the image is bigger and brighter.  It wasn't immediately obvious to me that it would really make that much difference, but after some time shooting with it, it grows on you.  I suspect if I went back to the D3200 or D5200 now, I'd be pretty put off.  It's still not very useful for precise manual focus, though - you need either a real focusing screen added after-market, or to use live-view.  I hope one day Nikon gets with the program and adds focus peaking.Low-light performance does seem slightly but noticeably poorer than the D5200, though still good in absolute terms.  In particular, the D5200 just has a way of hiding high-ISO noise to the eye, which the D3200 (with its large blotchy noise patterns) and the D7100 (with a sharper, more high-contrast high-frequency noise pattern) seem less adept at.  Shooting RAW, at least.  There does seem to be a quite visible improvement in sharpness, courtesy primarily of the missing low-pass filter, though you likely won't see the difference with kit lenses.  I haven't yet decided if the increased sharpness outweighs the more noticeable noise (particularly in terms of whether you can be more aggressive with noise reduction and get a better final result - in theory this should be true).It's too early to tell how different the AF system is compared to the other models.  It'd be awesome if it were as big an improvement as from the D3200 to the D5200 - the latter has a *much* better AF system (in terms of speed, accuracy and reliability) - but so far at least it hasn't wowed me.  It certainly seems no worse than the D5200's, of course.  I do occasionally use f/8-max-aperture lenses (usually because of a teleconverter), which the D7100 officially supports, but then the D5200 also supports them in practice in my experience, so I'm not expecting any difference there.It is heavy.  The weight gain over the D3200/D5200 is quite a bit greater in perception than the spec sheet numbers would indicate.  I do get tired using this body for an extended period, in a way I never had problems with on the lighter models.  Even with a three pound lens on it, which by all reason should wash out the difference in body weights.  I had hoped it would be a bit more comfortable with larger or heavy lenses because of a better balance, but alas I haven't actually noticed that in practice.I also find it a little more awkward to use than the D3200 or D5200, though possibly I just need more time to get used to it.  In particular, I have a hard time using the front control dial for some reason.  It's just somehow difficult to reach.  I have fairly large hands, so you'd think the substantially larger grip of the D7100 would help for ergonomics - and indeed it's one of the reasons I upgraded to it - but so far, that's been a disappointment.  Thankfully it's a lot more configurable than the lower models, so you can readily assign all important functions to the back control dial instead.In a nutshell, I think for most people you either know that you really want the D7100, and should get it, or you don't, in which case you'd be better off with the D5300.", "Date": "December 10, 2013"}, {"Title": "I adore this camera!", "Author": "K.

They offer a remote release (an absolutely essential item) but every time the camera is turned off, for any reason (like removing the memory card for a download and view on a monitor), you must completely set up the remote release function again. And again, and again, and again. So if you are a studio guy (we are), you'll wear out the menu buttons setting this thing up every time you shoot!

Try starting at over $600, and you've got to have two of them to talk to each other!

And I am so not disappointed!  This camera has and does it all!...and it has every potential to grow with your abilities...There are two memory slots so you have back up or can use one for recording and one for pics to keep them separate. There is an attachment available to have a back up battery as well, but it is a separate purchase.  The crisp, clear pictures are beyond anything I have had from an essentially point and shoot camera.  This is great for beginners as well as those more experienced...and anyone in between.  You can make this as automatic or as manual as you would like...completely personalized for the best experience.  There is a menu knob on top as well as menus for each setting.  They are all pretty easy to utilize and customize. The manual gives step by step directions on much of it to make it even easier. The battery lasts quite long, depending on the mode you use it in and what settings you are using. Recording and using the option to see on the screen as apposed to in the viewer will definitely decrease the battery life.  Even then, it lasts a few hours.It does not come with a lens, but I honestly love that.  You can save the money from buying the standard \"kit\" type packages and buy what you really want.  Also, if upgrading, the lenses on other Nikons work the same on this one.  I already had two lenses, so I use them on this and they are fabulous. There are two different types of lens though...I have the regular, run of the mill, out of the box lenses... and it works with them as easily as the more professional AFs.The ONLY downsides I have found are the bulk, manual (sort of), and price.  This camera is a bit heavier than my previous D3200.  With the added battery back up, it is even larger and heavier.  This is definitely not a little pocket camera for you to pull out quickly and shoot. The price is definitely on the expensive side as well...but buying it on black Friday saved me a ton!  I am not sure I would have bought it for the normal price...not that it isn't completely worth it, but I am not a professional and that kind of money is a lot to me. The manual is HUGE!  There are so many functions and options, it has to be.  However, it is beautifully arranged to find what you need quickly...and it makes it much easier to go from point and shoot to knowing what you are doing by adjusting settings and picking schemes.I know people personally that use this camera for their photography businesses and absolutely love it as well...one of the reasons I was leaning toward it.", "Date": "February 6, 2014"}, {"Title": "It is perfect.", "Author": "Vlad Tesileanu", "ReviewID": "R3SM1IOE0UABCM", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "Hi, I'm very happy with this DSLR.

I decided to make the change and sold all of my Sony/Minolta gear and made the the switch to Nikon. On the first day of ownership, image# DSC 0001, I noticed that the focus was soft.  I took a few more shots and noticed the same thing. I had previously purchased a 35mm 1.8G lens, and based on all of the great reviews related to the sharpness of this lens, I could not understand why I was getting soft images. My love for the D7100 led me to believe that it was a lens or settings issue, so I ordered another lens 55-300mm VR II, and attacked YouTube for settings that were suppose to help with focusing issues.  After all of this, the camera was still providing soft images.  After being very discouraged and questioning my decision to leave Sony for Nikon, I finally decided to exchange it for a different body. I am happy to report that focus is now tack sharp with both lenses that I own.  This is a truly remarkable piece of engineering and is a major step up from what I previously owned.If you are on the fence about the D7100, make the leap and purchase.

Then got the d5200 and was quite surprised how much different that camera was compared to the 3200, I almost kept the d5200, but there was a couple things I was not happy with but could have lived with. So I returned the d5200, and preordered the d7100, had about a month wait, but well worth it. This camera is bigger than either one of the other two, which fits my hands much better, the ownerers manual is 3/4 of an inch thick compared to maybe an 1/8 inch thick on the d5200. The best thing I like is this model has two thumb wheels, one on the back of the camera right above where your thumb will naturally go, and one just below the shutter button where your index finger will naturally be, so you can use the back one to adjust shutter, and the front to set aperature, this makes it extremely easy to use in manual mode, so easy in fact I almost always shoot this way,. With the 5200 you only had one wheel on the back, so to adjust shutter you had to use the same wheel for adjusting aperature plus push another button to switch from aperature adjust to shutter adjust, all three cameras are completely different in many respects in my opinion, not just added features, the d7100 other than processing power really is a completely different camera, I love it, very Happy. I use this camera both commercially as well as just plain fun. I am so glad I opted to upgrade from the d5200, but if your a woman or fairly new to dslr's, you may find the d5200 a better fit for your hand and its lighter, These issues were not a concern for me and this camera fits my hand much better, and is definitly a more professional camera in every respect, their is a very good reason the owners manual is so thick!

Norton", "ReviewID": "RYG88GV870IRD", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "This camera is almost perfect. At the very end of this review I will explain why this camera is not perfect.VIEWFINDERThere is a nice sized viewfinder on the back of the camera. It is NOT a touch screen. It does NOT swivel out.PICTURE QUALITYStunning. I took some images on the lowest camera setting and the pics still looked good, it was as if I could put my hand in the photograph and pull out the people. The images had a 3D look.LENSI purchased this camera with the 18-140mm and 55-300mm lens. The 18-140 lens will do about 95% of what most users will need. The lower end is great for wide angle shots and the upper end is awesome for portrait work. It's nice to have the 55-300mm lens but on a daily basis, 18-140 is sufficient.SENSORThis is a DX sensor (23.5mm x 15.6mm) which lets in a lot of light. Light is what a photo is made from. The next best sensor, for all intense purposes, is a full frame sensor. This DX is more than adequate for most individuals. If you are not sure of which sensor size you need then the DX is perfect.MEDIAThis camera has two SD slots and can take SD, SDHC, and SCXC cards. Mine came with a 32gb SD card.WIRELESSMy camera came with the WU-1a wireless adapter. The adapter works ok, I just wish it was built in instead of having it dangling on the side of the camera.BATTERYPlease buy and extra battery. I am only getting about 400 images off a charge.FLASHThe built in flash offers red eye reduction as well as other features.USER MANUAL - SHOULD YOU READ IT?Don't do it. This manual will have you jumping all over the place. Instead I recommend the book Mastering the Nikon D7100 by Darrell Young.  Although the included Nikon manual is less than desirable, the camera is still excellent.NEGATIVE - WHY THIS CAMER IS NOT PERFECTThe only negative of this camera is that it does not include an option to place a date and time stamp (date imprint) directly onto a jpeg file - for those of us who want that option it is major. You can imprint the date and time if using a pic Bridge printer which equals useless. The work around is to buy a software program, either [Easy Batch Photo] or [Batch Photo]. Both of those programs work on the Mac (not sure about the PC). If buying software is not an option AND you want the date imprinted on your jpeg files then I recommend purchasing the Nikon D5200 instead. The later will give the same photo quality as the D7100. FYI: the images will have the date listed on the EXIF data but when you print the images you will need to hand write the date or use one of the software programs I mentioned above to have the date printed. Why is this feature so important to me? I am heavy into genealogy and I want to document the date the photo is taken. Although everything NOW is in the present tense, 50 years from now the images will be in the past tense. I have a family photo taken in 1906 and one taken in 1917. I know the year because it was written on the image. I would like to do the same for my descendants. Nikon, please offer an update to include this feature. If it is an option then those who do not want it can just turn it off.Final thoughts, this is a great camera and I definitely recommend it. But if I had it to do all over again I would NOT buy it because there is no date/time stamp option.", "Date": "May 17, 2014"}, {"Title": "Slightly better than my venerable D90 but not a great upgrade.", "Author": "C. Sulto", "ReviewID": "RLGZQYP61IHE8", "Overall": "3.0", "Content": "I have been a Nikon user for many years and I shoot semi pro here and there when needed.  I don't need too many features to take a shot and I don't need to spend a fortune either just for bragging rights but would like a good all around camera.  I have known many great photographers from the past that can best anything with simple old school devices so the \"features\" in these newer cameras are questionable.The D90 was my previous DSLR and worked well with a very good low light sensor.  I found myself using the video feature more than I expected and without a continuous auto focus in video, the D90 was not cutting it.  In sunlight you can not see the LCD well enough to manually focus video so it had to go.  The D7100 was the closest replacement (Nikon) but with an auto focus video mode so I opted for it.Once received, I immediately generated a set of indoor test images between the D90 and the D7100 using controlled lighting, same lenses, settings, etc.  In a blind test with a fellow photographer, he was barely able to choose the D7100 over the D90 in 2/3's of the hundreds of images -- I could hardly tell the difference either.  There are some features with the shutter speed that is better with the D7100 but overall it is a minor upgrade at best in image quality.The D7100, even with the 51-point focus, still suffers from poor logic in any and all modes for focus.  Like all other Nikon's I have had, I end up using point focus or just go manual when it counts as the software does not know what to focus on for the most part.  Even simple tests I have made it is a hit or miss what it does for auto focus.  It would be nice to leave that aspect alone when shooting sometimes but I can't it seems.  The focus gets much worse as the light trails off which you may expect given the contrast detection  I assume it uses in the algorithm since the only time it gets it right is in bright light.  My friend's D800 seems to be very similar in our tests for auto focus logic (or lack thereof).I still find myself just going near full manual to get a shot I really care about all in all.  I would like to simply use an auto mode and hand the camera off to a friend to take some images I would be in, but I can never trust these Nikons to do the right thing.  I often just bring a point and shoot for those times to make sure I at least get a shot of some kind.  Would be nice to rely on one camera though.The video mode works well enough but also has odd focus problems, but at least it has something to help when you can not see the LCD well enough in bright outdoor light.  If it was not for the lenses I have for it I may just use an HD point and shoot for video as it usually handles focus better for some reason -- lacks image quality of course.\\Overall it has been so-so.  The battery does not last as long as in the D90 either.I may consider other makes next time as this price range for Nikon is seemingly just upped megapixel rehashes of the past with mostly more bells and whistles.", "Date": "December 30, 2013"}, {"Title": "Dust, resolved easily, but still dust.", "Author": "Ernesto Sabogal Gomez", "ReviewID": "R1DI7HHV4X5JYC", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "Upgraded from a stolen D5100, which I liked a lot.I love this camera and would have gave it 5 stars but after a few shots some spots appeared on my photos.

I never thought I would buy such a camera but I made the jump.My main criteria for the purchase was the praised AF system for moving subjects and the easy access to camera controls. I come from the EPL1 and had been fiddling quite a bit with aperture, ISO, etc. and ultimately wanted more direct control. The D7100 requires you to know what you are doing so I have spent some time learning about proper techniques by reading a few books, blogs and magazines (and taking quite a few pictures).Ultimately I would have preferred something smaller and less heavy because I follow a kid around quite a bit...but I decided to go for it in order to get the best tracking-AF possible for a camera under $1500.I also would have preferred a better liveview AF but I am becoming acquainted with taking pictures mostly with the viewfinder (which is better anyway). Liveview shooting is, however still relevant is some tricky situations.So if you put the effort do you get better pictures and a lower rate a missed pictures? Yes you do.Pros- Fast and (mostly) accurate AF in good-to-ok light when shooting through the viewfinder- Excellent picture quality- Easy access to basic controlsCons- Some noise comes up quite early in the picture (IS0 640)- slow liveview AF compared to viewfinder AF (sometimes it would come handy when taking pictures on the fly or in tricky positions)- Taking a video requires pushing three buttons in default settings and camera output is merely ok (this a picture-oriented camera).An annoyance but not too bad: if you shoot raw the camera buffer fills up after taking 5 pictures. Too few for burst shooting. Just shoot JPEG for better performance.Unlike the D5200 I won't complain about the lack of touchscreen because this camera provides easy access to controls.

Its friggin awesome.  If you need a camera to encourage you to push your photography to new heights,  this is it.Build quality is the best I have owned so far.  again Im the average guy so im not gonna compare this to a 5000 dollar camera and say the build quality could be better than it is because thats stupid.

However, depending on what you plan to use it or what camera body you have been using, your experiences with this camera can be very different.My experience with this camera is coming from a person who already own D600 and want to have another body for wildlife as well as backup camera. Consequently, what I need the most from D7100 is the continuous speed shooting capability and decent picture quality - especially when comparing with D600. So, from this perspective, unfortunately I I do have 3 major issues with D7100 and I would give it 3 stars.1)  Small buffer size: Apparently, the advertised 6 fps or 7fps (cropped mode) is probably feasible if you shoot in JPEG. If you are a RAW shooter, the shooting speed will drop to 3-4 fps after approx 10 shots were released (with 95 MB/S SD card) and it will take a while before the buffer is cleared. Well.... this won't work with wildlife shot!2) Picture quality is very good but definitely a different league when compared to D600. Although this is not such a deal breaker but definitely worth noting.3) Build quality. I may be a few of the unlucky ones who got a defected copy of this camera. For some reasons, I found that sometime the camera won't focus with heavy lens such as 70-200mm or 200-400mm unless I remove the lens and put it back again. Looks like loose connection??? Come on Nikon, I still have to deal with oil on the sensors on my D600 and now another problem with D7100???However, if you're upgrading from other DX bodies such as D90 or D7000, this camera will be a significant upgrade and it definitely worth 5 stars!So, on average, I will give it 4 stars!", "Date": "August 1, 2013"}, {"Title": "D7100 is awesome", "Author": "Carlos Alberto Barba de la Mora", "ReviewID": "R13LCLFNBA1E8P", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "Ok this is just a brief review i previously own the D7000 which i got a year ago and i love the camera and decided to get the new D7100 mostly because of the new 51 point AF system which is awesome by the way it focus faster even on low light situations. I've been testing both cameras and the quality of the pictures are just about the same the only difference i notice is the D7000 creates much more chromatic aberration the D7100 doesn't seem to have that problem so if you were looking to get better quality images from this new D7100 i doubt this is the camera for you but if you are looking forward to get excellent AF results this is the camera for you It pretty much inherit the AF system from Nikon's D4 and the D800 which is awesome also the camera feels better in the hand it's more comfortable then the D7000, I also recommend getting the MB-D15 battery grip for this camera cause it's a little more power hungry than the D7000.Also if you are the type of person who's not looking forward to learn how to fully use the camera on Manual mode save some bucks and just go for a D5200 or D3200 you will only get the most out of this camera if you learn how to use it on Manual just saying cause i've read many reviews with people complaining about it.", "Date": "June 8, 2013"}, {"Title": "d7100", "Author": "shyla", "ReviewID": "R3Q0W2B2VLIJCT", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "Haven't gone through all features yet but have shot lots of pics,all very impressive.

And this is a good second DSLR.  Best purchase I've made in many many years.  Almost everything I couldn't do (and wanted to do) with my old camera, I can with this one.  And just about everything they both could do is easier on this one.  It is quite a big step up from the entry level cameras of a few years ago.So while I love this camera there are a few downsides, But these don't matter enough to stop recommending this camera.Minor complaints...1.  No aperture change in video live-view.  I believe the newer, lower-end Nikon D5300 allows this.  Disappointing they didn't add this feature to the D7100.2.  Manual mode camera live-view exposure doesn't update with aperture/ISO/shutter speed changes.  I think there is a workaround with the OK button, but this is a little annoying.3.  Zoom buttons... coming from a camera where the main dial could be rotated to zoom in and out, using a button just seems awkward by comparison.  This is an issue in photo playback only.4.  ISO change.  It seems awkward to press a button on the back and then use the screen at the top to see the ISO selected.  Why couldn't  they display the ISO on the screen that is on the same face as the button?My favorite features of the camera:1.  Compatibility.  There are seriously hundreds of lenses and other accessories around for it.2.  Bracketing.  With one button and a dial turn or two, I can turn bracketing on and off, or change the number of frames and the number of stops between them.3.  Frames per second. When shooting movement, 7 FPS is a big deal.4.  Auto focus performance. The focus points almost completely cover the frame.  And it is so fast and accurate.5.  Sharpness... the lack of AA filter really shows.  and with 24MP, I'm loving the ability to crop generously after using a prime lens.I started with the Nikon 35mm f/1.8 and recently added a Nikon 70-300mm f/4.5-5.6.  I think in the future I will buy 3rd party macro and a 3rd party wide angle lens.  Tokina seems to be doing better for the money than Nikon is in those categories.I recommend this type of kit as opposed to buying this camera with a kit lens.

It replaced a Canon SX50HS (~$500) once I knew my recent interest in birding would continue. The pictures aren't as good as the Canon (24-1200 35mm equivalent). I contacted Nikon, sent them some pictures, and got a response that \"I should increase my depth of field\". I don't think they really looked at the pictures. The selected birds on gravel or grass so they could see everything was out of focus. Also, I should be able to focus on the bird with the f5.6. I thought I might not be holding it steady even though I could hold the Canon steady with greater zoom. I increased the shutter to 1/4000 of a second, no change.This can only be serviced by Nikon, in desperation, I went to a local camera repair that specializes in Nikon. I currently have the battery out, waiting a few weeks for the camera to go back to factory settings. Then I'll take some test pictures requested by the repair shop. He will look at the pictures, test different lenses on the body and different bodies on the lens. If it is determined that there is a problem, he'll send it to Nikon. I will have to pay for his services to get Nikon to fix this under warrantee.If I can't get it working right, I have no choice but to put it into the back of a closet and swallow my $4000 loss.

Glad I did. While it has some issues, focus is not as quick as I had hoped  (may be lens-based), overall the camera produces excellent images that lend themselves well to cropping for composition and subject enhancement. The 24MP sensor is the key that this body is built around and it is very crisp, so crisp that I have to be very careful to hold the camera steady even with image stabilization. Shake will be very evident if you are a grab shot type of shooter. Give your self time to steady down and focus and you will get quality images that you  will be proud to show others. The additional 1:3 crop mode is great for sports as it puts the image area almost entirely under the 51 point focusing system. The buffer is more than adequate if you are shooting JPEG's as I do, especially for sports. I have ripped off 8-10 shots with no sign of slowdown do to buffer capacity filling.  As I don't usually shoot RAW, I can't speak to the buffer issue when shooting that way.Check out my uploaded images for some samples from  this body.Handling is excellent for my small hands. Everything falls to hand with ease and is so similar to the D7000 that the small differences are easily overcome. I like the lock button on the mode dial. I have unintentionally changed modes on the D7k and been frustrated that shots didn't turn out the way I had planned,  not with this. I would have liked a protector over the rear screen but as it is supposed to be made of 'gorilla glass' ( Used on tablets and smart phones) it seems, so far, to be impervious to marks or scratches. Having had the body for a month, (Apr 17-May 15th 3k+ images) I can say I am more  than  pleased with image quality and overall handling. A 50% increase in sensor resolution doesn't hurt either. Wish I could rate it at 4 1/2 stars for the  minor issues I have had. If you are a DX format shooter looking to upgrade your body, you could scarcely do better. For an excellent review on technical aspects of this camera check out DPReview for their review of this body.

I like being able to manually adjust the focus point to get a light reading on the highlights to keep from blowing them out.  The auto selection of focus point keeps jumping all around with each half-way press of the shutter button. So I'm left with having to move to the manual switch, take a light reading from a single point, set my exposure and then switch back to automatic and compose the shot.  It's a bit of a drag and yesterday, I found myself taking my trusty D90 along and leaving the 7100 behind.

When I went to adjust it, the wheel would not turn.  I applied more pressure and got it to turn one click.  I kept playing with the wheel, hoping that it would loosen, but it's defective and worthless to use to adjust the diopter.  So, back it goes.Luckily, I bought it from Amazon.  They deserve kudos for their customer service.  The downside is that Amazon is out of stock and will only offer a refund.

It supports FX lenses, which I now own two. If you are going to buy this camera go for just the body, the kit lenses that come with it don't do the camera any justice. I suggest you add a few pennies and get a decent FX lens (yes you can use full frame lenses with the camera). So when you want to upgrade to full frame later, you'll already have full frame lenses.

With 40 years as a Nikon shooter with almost all their cameras (starting with Nikormats) and god know how many lenses, I know a little about photography. I was also a beta tester on the original Photoshop, I'm that old. So I bought this camera as a replacement for my D90 as my DX shooter for birds, with the 300af-s +1.4TC combo. I knew about the small buffer -(hey its REALLY friggin small and bites you just at the wrong moment, to the point you loose all chimping capability without a camera restart) but expected a big resolution upgrade. The fact is whatever marginally you gain in resolution the tradeoff is really bad noise in the shadows at any iso because the sensor Nikon had utilized for this camera is the same 24Mpix APS-C sensor as the D5200 and entry-level D3200 models. The pixel density is equivalent to that of a 56-Mpix full-frame 35mm camera!! Sounds great, right? Not so fast, they cram that many pixels be using the smallest possible \"pitch\" measured in microns.Let's compare cameras shall we?D700 - 8.45 microns, FX, 12MP - winner - look at the prices asked for USED copies!D4 - 7.3m, FX, 16MPD610 - 5.9m, FX, 24MPD800 - 4.88m, FX, 36MPD7000 - 4.78m, DX, 24MPD7100 - 3.9m, DX, 24MP ----  DOWNGRADE from the D7000D5200 - 3.9m, DX, 24MPD3200 - 3.84m, DX, 24MPAll pixels collect the same amount of noise, but larger pixels collect more of the \"good\" data than smaller pixels. With all else equal, a larger pixel will result in a higher quality image (less noise) than a smaller one. The pixels of the D7100 are so small my D200 produces better images that need less work in post-processing.People ooh and aah over the resolution of this camera, but after you run the image through your noise reduction program - which ads blur - you are throwing that extra resolution away. No complaints about build, focus are other factors, those are all to taste. Do yourself a favor and pick up a D700 or a D610 and compare the image to the D7100.

I selected the D7100 over the D5200 mostly because I wanted the larger view finder (I rarely use the LCD for framing up a shot, and tend not to do videos with my SRL as I have a pretty decent video camera that does a better job of that). I tested out the camera with the same lenses as my current, and if definitely is better performer.  But I have has some issues.  I recently did a week long vacation to Utah national parts and tooks ~3500 photos.  The camera would frequently lock up, and either be hung up for 15-30 seconds, or longer in which I would turn camera off then back on to bring back to life (that never happened with my D5100).  Also, I do not like having to push a release button down to turn the program mode wheel.  I do not know why they need to lock the wheel since I never had my D5100 accidentally move to another  program setting.

I guess they had to do this because the put the wheels on top top of the other and it is hard to get to one without touching the other.  I found the D5100 much easier and fast to change programs.  I have also has a little bit of issue with the camera body recognizing lenses.  I never that that problem with the same lenses on my D5100.  I had a few problems on this recent trip, where I had to remove lens and reattach.  In hindsight, I'm thinking I should have gone for the D5200 and save some money.

The very first thing that was wrong with it straight out of the box, was a huge chunk of some sort of dirt on the sensor, clearly visible at f5.6. OK, i turned on the cleaning function, and it was gone. So I hoped that would be the worst thing that would happen. I never had any issues with my D90 for 4 years.Wrong! As i was trying out the interval exposure setting, the autofocus motor just gave up. Well, I decided to change the lens. It wouldn't even lock. It seems that the motor is done and i cant secure the lens. Keep in mind thats within 2 hours and under 200 actuations through the camera.I'll give it another shot as i get my replacement, and post the update.P.s. just so we are clear, it broke while using the Nikon 35mm f1.8, and didn't work with 17-55mm f2.8 and Sigma 10-20mm either.Update. Amazon customer service is the best. They shipped out my replacement already using one day Sat delivery. I don't even have to go to UPS to drop the broken camera off, the UPS driver will get it.23 March 2013 update. The replacement is here. this camera is absolutely wonderful. Slight front focus, but nothing that couldn't be fixed by the in-camera adjustment. The video quality is absolutely superb and looks awesome on my 60\" Bravia.

Wheather this D7100 is used in RAW or jpeg the other cameras are just as good, less expensive and some are even sharper.  I owned the D7000 for three years, which i sold not too long ago, so i also have THOUSANDS of photos taken from that camera.  From all the fuss that's going around i thought the D7100 was WAY BETTER and i was almost ready to buy one.I really wonder how many people here are actually nikon sales people, honestly, and that to me is REALLY REALLY disturbing. If they are not marketting employees they sure are nikon fanboys. I like nikon but if i get to the point where i start telling lies or imagine that a camera is better when is not, now that would mean that there is something wrong with me. The AF of the D7100 is FANTASTIC for sure, but IQ i think people are just wanting to imagine things that are actually not true, specially when i see a recent review for the D7100 that says that the D7100 BLOWS the D7000 away. That's just plain RIDICULOUS. I have owned D200, D7000, Fuji S5 PRO and have used a D300 and own many nikon lenses and i would definitely see a big difference in IQ from the D7100 compared to most these cameras, but the D7100 is only a hair better in picture quality between the D7000, which right now you can buy the D7000 at a BARGAIN price.Now that i have finished my comment, all of you can start saying \"well, did you buy the camera???\" \"Your review is pointless and useless and invalid since you did not buy the camera\".", "Date": "April 13, 2013"}, {"Title": "Nikon, what were you thinking?", "Author": "Nanhenker", "ReviewID": "RPDZH5WNFQZ0G", "Overall": "3.0", "Content": "I own a Nikon D5000 with a couple of Nikkor lenses and an older Nikon Coolpix, both of which are phenoms.  I bought the D7100 body because I wanted  more MPs or bigger enlargement capability for wall art.  My first impressions:  It's way heavier and bulkier than the D5000, The dual card slots idea is a great improvement.  Turn it on and snap a few times..., YIKES!!  On Large picture size, this camera is a light hog and I can't stop aperture past F 11 except outdoors in bright daylight.  The White Balance will  not get me a white color, on ANY standard setting, based on the LCD monitor...  white is either very blue, gray, or brown.  I fiddle with ISO, white balance, and picture control for hours (days, actually)  before I realize that most all photos do best set to Neutral picture control, otherwise the colors are blown out, mostly to the over-warm side.  (The best part of this may be that the camera will turn silver to gold in High Key setting.)  The one exceptional thing about Nikon for me has been the gorgeous flesh tones, this camera must be set to Neutral or Portrait modes otherwise faces look bubble gum pink.  BUT...I have learned that the LCD monitor is not a good representation of actual color when displayed elsewhere, both a relief as well as an annoyance.  I found most of the effects to be gimmicky, and many settings to be unnecessary if one edits in Photoshop anyway.  It is cool to be able to shoot both in RAW and JPG on separate cards.  Then, I tried video...OMG.  The faster phase detection autofocus is disabled, making slow focus, and the thing sounds like the mechanical owl in the original Clash of the Titans.  I did want to do HD SLR video, now am I going to be stuck doing static tripod mounted talking heads?  We'll see.  So far, the camera takes great pics but the white balance and light hogginess of it I can't quite get past yet...I hope to write a better review after more experience someday.UPDATE:I have to continue to state that this camera has issues, most of which are also mentioned in author written help guides, but I have learned to live with and work around most of them.  I am now shooting only 100% manual in RAW only. I have given up on white balance, after using a white card and still not getting white, so I set the camera for \"cloudy\" for all outdoor shots and \"flash\" for any shots under incandescent, whether or not I use flash, and then try to adjust in Camera Raw / Photoshop. I have mostly given up on video, after I made an experiment during a bright noon-day snowstorm in which I could only get visible snowflakes at 1/250 shutter speed at aperture F4  at 55 mm.  (At smnaller apertures the snowflakes looked like After Effects special effect rain with a slower shutter speed.) I have learned to \"override\" the camera's internal software, I want what I want, not what the camera thinks I want. It also became fatiguing carrying it around steep mountains at 8000 ft all day, as I found out yesterday.  My advice is, try one out before you buy it, and put it through its paces to see if you like the way it thinks!", "Date": "February 13, 2014"}, {"Title": "Great image quality, awkward controls", "Author": "Neutral grey", "ReviewID": "R2H10M3W5NHRXW", "Overall": "3.0", "Content": "To put the review into some perspective, I upgraded to the D7100 from a D3100 after having it for 18 months.  The main reason I made the move was that I was shooting in full manual and wanted the extra controls, the extra focus points, the internal motor, the low light capabilities and a better screen.  I will first discuss the positives about the camera very briefly and mainly focus on what I perceive as the cons, as the cons are probably most useful to those considering making a new purchase.Pros:  Image quality is superb.  Much better than the D3100 and the D3100 was good.  I would say the image quality is professional caliber. Focus is blazing fast.  The internal motor makes the lenses focus a lot faster.  Low light is outstanding, much better than the D3100. You can take a good photo, hand held in nearly complete darkness. You can photograph things at night better then your eyes can see.  There is a button for everything and you have a lot of control.  The camera has a really nice grip and feels solid.  The display is amazing, absolutely bright and sharp. That better screen alone is reason to upgrade, as the D3100 had a terrible screen.Cons:  There are some awkward controls that you should be aware of this.1) The user's manual is not user friendly. The cameras functions are very different then the D3100.  Prepare to invest time in learning the controls and setting up the controls. Be prepared to buy Douglas Kosterman's Nikon D7100 Experience unless you are upgrading from and D7000 or D600, as this a different camera from the D3100. For $1200 why can't Nikon give some decent instructions?2) The controls and menu are not intuitive.  Unless you use this camera daily, you will not remember how to use the buttons or menu controls. I would not advise this camera to a first time DSLR user who will only use it occasionally. Stick with the D3200 or 5200 which are easier to use.  I have not used a comparable Canon or Pentax DSLR, but there must be a better way to set up a camera than this.3) The ISO button is in a bad location:  The ISO button, image quality size button, and white balance button are all bunched together on the front of the camera. If you accidentally press the image quality or WB button and then hit the command or subcommand dial you will accidentally change it.  You will not notice this until you download your pictures and find out that they are screwed up.  Both of these happened to me.  The command dial changes the ISO and the subcommand dial changes it to and from Auto ISO. The subcommand dial also controls the F-stop. When you are shooting full manual you are constantly adjusting ISO, F-stop and shutter speed.  After changing the ISO, if you don't remember to take your thumb off the ISO button you will accidentally change to Auto-ISO when you try to change the F-stop.  This happens to me all the time.4) The autofocus button is in awkward location on the front on the camera.5) The Video controls are not intuitive and it takes some time to learn how to take a video. You have to set the ISO, aperture and shutter speed, so this takes getting used to.6) There may be autofocus problems:  The focus is very fast but not always accurate.  Even when you are using spot focus, I am not always sure that it picks up what you are focusing on if it is a busy seen. No problems focus in low light though.7) The Fn button cannot be assigned to ISO. On the D3100 the Fn was defaulted as the ISO button and it was terrific.  The Fn can be assigned to about 18 things, none of which is ISO.  The Fn button is the natural choice for ISO, not on the front of the computer.8) The grey card setup is complicated and you will have to refer to the manual often.  The manual is an inch think and will not fit in your camera back.  The grey card is such an important function that it should be easy and intuitive.9) There is no panorama function. Why does my IPhone 5 have panorama and this doesn't?10)  The mode dial has two unnecessary locks on it.  There is little chance that you will inadvertently turn the mode dial, yet it has two locks. There is about a 100% chance that at some point you will inadvertently press some other button that is all over the camera and turn the command dial, mess up your shot and you won't know about it until you download the pictures.11)  Battery life is only fair, buy extra batteries.Update May, 2014.After recently purchasing an Olympus EM-10, I can tell you that the D7100 is now obsolete and a dinasaur. I have dowgraded by rating from 4 to 3 stars.  Amazing what can happen in less than one year.  Compared to the EM-10, the controls on the D7100 are downright awful and Nikon should be embarrassed that they did not come up with a better design in the first place.  The mirorrless cameras have come so far that if Nikon and Canon does not come up with a comparable competitor they will likely both be out of business in the next decade. That is how good the new mirorrless cameras are.", "Date": "June 2, 2013"}, {"Title": "Depends what is important for you", "Author": "Peter S \"Peter S\"", "ReviewID": "R3H3HV9D0YENFV", "Overall": "3.0", "Content": "I got the camera despite reading about the banding issue (horizontal lines in pictures). I felt that banding is only one factor and with all the improvements, I will still like the D7100. Also I have read that the banding only comes out if RAW pictures are pushed +3 EV or more, which I would obviously would not be doing.Wrong.Banding comes out randomly, even on JPEGs, if the Automatic D-Lighting is on (I always had this on on all the NIKONs I owned). I just don't like it as it is SOOO digital. Why should we have horizontal lines on the pic? Can not this be fixed? There are some ways to fix it in RAW (using Raw Therapee) but very complicated and does not work perfectly (and takes a lot of time)Otherwise, the camera is very good, but unfortunately, I don't want the banding so I moved to the D7000 (downgrade). Unfortunately, the D7000 focus is not very reliable (issue also widely reported). My D5100 focus much more reliably!!! (a note: this is not the AF fine tune on the D7000 - I did try and fine tuning does not help. To me it seems the focus is randomly off, not a clear back or front focus)Maybe I am just unlucky, but I feel I can not get the Nikon I love. I also have a D5100 and I think I like that camera a LOT - focus well and the pics are very nice - but that one unfortunately does not have the the customization options and other benefits of the enthusiast lineup such as the D7000 and D7100...

These wraps only occupied about less than half the empty carton space, and were mainly arranged at the top of the items, leaving a great deal of space for the two inside boxes to slide around very freely.Also about half the plastic air pockets were deflated, providing even less protection.Clearly the two inside boxes had slid around significantly, as each showed a very obvious dent on a corner of each box.I have not yet used the camera and lens, but am very concerned that at the very least, optimum optical tolerances have been compromised, and that focus and longevity may be compromised as well.I am most concerned that Amazon would see fit to utilize such inferior packaging , especially for optical equipment.I am interested to see if any response from Amazon is forthcoming.It certainly makes a case for purchasing from a local vendor, where even if prices may be higher, you can see the quality of the unopened boxes in advance.", "Date": "December 5, 2013"}, {"Title": "No accessories included as stated on product description on Black Friday", "Author": "niufei99", "ReviewID": "R6LBGZBA0DSN2", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "\"Purchase this camera and receive a free 32 GB memory card and bag, and save hundreds on select Nikon lenses and speedlights. \"I bought on Black Friday,the website showed as top,but now I just received the SLR camera,there was no SD card and case.

F", "ReviewID": "R2J1QI3NP802J6", "Overall": "1.0", "Content": "Being the previous owner of a d5100, I bought this camera with high expectations.51 focus points 'improved' focus system? 24 Mpixel? No anti-aliasing filter? 'sharpest and best DX Nikon camera ever'? I'm sold!Unfortunately, the reality of this camera does not live up to this at all. I received this camera and popped my 50 mm 1.4D on it, and started taking some shots inside. The first thing i noticed is the graininess of the photos. Checked ISO, 600 - 800 and this much grain? hmm, red flag number 1. My d5100's 16 Mpixel sensor was quieter than this.The next thing i noticed; many of the photos weren't properly focused. Uh oh. Red flag number 2.How could this be? Does nikon really not know how to make cameras that focus? They've been making cameras for 100 years. I took many more (approx. 1000) test shots in various lighting conditions and on various targets over the next few days, mostly at F 2 - 2.8 with the 50 and my 35 mm 1.8. If i did a rain dance to the gods, stood on one foot, patted my head and rubbed my stomach first, I could MAYBE get 50% of the shots to be in focus. So let me get this straight, I pay 1200 dollars for a camera, and it is in focus half the time? Nice try, Nikon.I tried all sorts of camera settings including the spiffy AF fine tune, and that didn't seem to help at all. Sometimes at would be front focus, sometimes it was back focus, sometimes spot on. Changing the focus point didn't seem to help much.What good are 51 focus points if the thing is never in focus? Ol' trusty d40 had less than a tenth of the focus points and that thing was 90% spot on.Some other things of note:1. I'm convinced that the 1.3 crop mode is a marketing ploy to get uninformed consumers to think they are getting 'extra length' from their lenses. All it is is a crop mode. The only thing you get is maybe a frame per second extra speed.2. The locking buttons for the mode dials are actually VERY useful. However, the awkward lower shutter mode dial is, well, awkward to use. Maybe if it had a textured finish it would be better.3. I put on my external Nikon SB-600 flash and was not getting consistent results. A lot of the time the photos were overexposed. This worked flawlessly on both D5100 and D60.4. After having it for a week, I was starting to see dust spots on the sensor at small apertures (high f numbers). If this happens to you, do the sensor cleaning function, it seems to help a lot.5. The LCD is fixed, which is a good thing. One of my main complaints about the d5100 was the lcd getting dust inside it since the edges weren't encased in the camera due to the gimmicky swivel feature.6. A great feature of the D5100 was that you could half-way press the shutter button and the viewfinder would light up the ISO that it will be shooting at. This was a great feature. Nikon for some reason removed this feature with the D7000, and kept it removed with the d7100. WHY? No one knows. Nice job Nikon. They have it on the D600.Another comment is probably too many megapixels goin' on here. The only people who would use 24 megapixels are professionals who are printing at large sizes, and need the massive resolution - which i would wager is a small segment of who uses this camera. Not amateurs that are posting pictures on facebook.It would have been nice if they kept the same amount of focus points and made them better, rather than trying to put ZOMG 51 focus points OMG!Rather than deal with Nikon (lack of) service, i opted to just return the camera. RETURNed, not replaced. Need I say more?UPDATE 8-24-13Forgot to post here, I returned this second copy of D7100, just too many quality control issues. I went with the D600, whose Image quality blows this thing out of the water. It's funny how night and day the two cameras DX anf FX are.

I changed focused points to 9-points/single point and tried all other focus servo modes and result has not changed. I mostly take pictures of my toddler which is in motion so I thought the issue is action. But I have taken more than 300 image recently from stationary object/subjects like my daughter on the high chair and the result is not any different. To compare, my 8MP Olympus can produce sharper images from a stationary objects under same conditions than this camera. One last thing is AF-fine tuning which I have not tried yet, but I believe a high-end consumer camera like this should be able to perform out of the box with no need of fiddling with AF. Overall I am very disappointed and advise against this model.Edit: To clarify further, I have used tripod to take pictures of stationary objects as was recommended by some friends in this forum with similar results. The images of high contrast or textured objects gain more focus than the centered smooth and neutral colored objects.

I've so far only tested it on my kids in the backyard and on random objects in my house. The autofocus is really fast. I used to have the D300 and the autofocus on the d7100, speed wise, is superior.

If it's lost in transportation or some unwanted bystanders in a neighborhood picking up someone else's property, Nikon will undoubtedly deny its responsibility with their cocky Japanese attitude, \"everything is well within Nikon's 100+ year old tradition of screwing our customers, in Yakuza style.Why spend so much money on this over-hyped, over-priced gadget, when there are plenty unsold units of previous model (I wonder why there is always so much unsold inventory of Nikon gears in the used market place), new but rebadged as refurbished D7000 for less than half?

Considering this is newer and has the OLPF removed, I expected better quality. What I got instead was a generic DSLR camera. Yes it shoots nice photos but so do $500 DSLRs littering the market. I have no idea why this camera has been hyped to the max. My 7D shot incredible magazine quality photos, straight out of the box, on full auto. This camera can't even match the quality of the 7D, forget about surpassing it. I really wanted to switch over to Nikon but all that counts ultimately is image quality and this camera is just another one in the bunch. Nothing stands out. You can see some sample images I uploaded. They are point and shoot jpg's without any processing or filters. You can see that it's a basic DSLR camera. Why does it cost so much? Unjustified price for this level of performance. Lame.I gave it two stars instead of one because it does have some technical \"wows\" such as megapixel count, shots per second, etc. etc. but why does that matter when the picture itself is generic quality you can get in a cheap DSLR? When you look at a picture, do you ask \"Wow! I wonder how many shots per second were used or the exact f-stop setting to capture this image?\" No. You either like the photo or you don't. I don't like what I see from the images from this camera.
