{"Reviews": [{"Title": "Samsung does it again", "Author": "ioBuddha", "ReviewID": "R3CX2EAYZM6ZCA", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I read all the early CES hands-on reviews and even though know one has reviewed this camera on Amazon I ordered the it. I needed a simple 'idiot-proof' camera when I am out on the town with my family and do not want to lug a full frame DSLR around. This is a review based on having played with the camera and all of it's settings for the last 4 hours. I shot about 100 pictures in various settings and even though I did not think the WiFi was something I cared about... it has been a real pleasure to use. I've owned a few Samsung 'Point and Shoots' (PNS) in the past and the image quality is excellent... this one is no exception. What I really wanted was a nice low-light camera and this model does it better than any I have tried in the last 2 years. I am an avid photographer and I shoot products images for a few companies and this camera could handle the task; which surprised me. First off it has many simple buttons that make it so easy to use that by image 50 I just turned on the AUTO button and it worked just as good as me manually setting the camera for the situation; that is what I wanted in a PNS. The WiFi was simple to use, just connect the cable to a PC and install the iLink software (built into the camera) and set it up for Auto-backup and it will download the software and connect to your router; meaning once you shoot it will Auto-Backup on the fly when you tell it to. No more pulling the SD card out and importing images. It also has a great on-board editing program along with a bunch of Instagram type filters if you want to look retro. I am very, very impressed by the low-light shooting and will update this review after a good week of use. But for now, this inexpensive Samsung is the one you want. I just put my Nikon Coolpix up for sale on Amazon and will fine tune this camera for my needs. In conclusion it is almost to idiot proof. The settings are so simple that anyone can take really nice photos. I have not tried the video yet, but when I do I will update the review.", "Date": "February 28, 2013"}, {"Title": "It's an alright camera", "Author": "James Mccarty \"expose\"", "ReviewID": "R13XUTX3OOJQX7", "Overall": "3.0", "Content": "I purchased this camera (the white one) locally at a Sams Club because it came with a kit for the same price as Amazon. Not really a great deal, but did it anyway. It came with a small case (useless as its too small to really fit the camera) and an 8gb Samsung sd card. (Woopy do, I saved $6 there) The build quality seems good. With one exception, the popup flash. I can bet anything this will eventually break. If it doesn't break due to users accidentally snapping it off, it will wear out from popping up and pushing it down. It is a little tricky pushing it back in too. I base this opinion on other cameras I have used.I found the cameras photo settings to be straight forward and easy to understand for most people. Full auto works ok, but P is the way to go for your best exposure. The flash worked reasonably well to about 12 feet or so. Any further in a less then normal to dimly lit room, and you will find your subject under exposed. On the other side, any closer then 4 feet and you will find your subject over exposed. The camera has a flash fill setting, but I found no difference between fill and auto.The image quality is best at 16mp (the highest setting) I would have rather used 10 or 12mp but the drop off in clarity was too great. The color was accurate and images were sharp. As long as you held really, really still. I found the camera to use a much slower shutter speed then the average person can hand hold. I don't think the anti-shake works well at all. I have used better. Especially with any amount of zoom.I was very disappointed with the response of the camera. It would often not take the picture when I pressed the shutter button. Example: I turn the camera on, point it at a person or object, press the button and get nothing. I had to resort to the slightly depressing the button to allow the camera to focus first, wait for the center green box or the face detecting boxes(depending on which setting I used) turn green, then press the button the rest of the way to take the picture. For a camera in 2013 I feel this is unexceptionable. Especially in this price range. It doesn't always do this, but it did most of the time.The other thing that really disappointed me was the WiFi feature. First the good. It connected to my Samsung S3 phone perfect. My S3 could control the camera to take photos, off load images, and use the remote view finder. It was easy to connect to Picasa and SkyDrive to offload images to the cloud. I assume Facebook and emailing would be the same. You can connect to your phone while outside of a local area connection. In other words, driving down the road or in the middle of nowhere with no wifi router in sight, you can connect to your phone. Nice feature for offloading images and using your phones internet connection to upload. The Direct Link button on the back of the camera can be programmed to do any of the WiFi functions with just one press.Now the bad. I was excited to program the Direct Link button to connect to Picasa and upload images. Well, when you press the button, it brings up 4 options. Facebook, Picasa, Email, and SkyDrive. I then have to press Picasa. It then opens up a gallery of images. I start selecting the ones I want to upload (there is no select all. That's stupid) and I get stopped at 12 selections with a message saying I have reached the limit. That makes this feature useless to me. To make matters worse, it doesn't even tell me where I left off so I don't select ones I already uploaded. The wifi is fast enough to upload the 12 images in about a minute or two (depending on your ISP's speeds) so I don't get the limit here.Some other thoughts: Image quality at higher iso's is pretty good. I took several shots at 400 to 3200 iso and was ok with the noise in the 1600 and 3200 iso range. 400 iso is the sweet spot I think. The camera's auto iso wants to hang aroung 100 iso which is why several of my shots without flash were blurry. If I were to keep this camera, 400 or 800 iso is where I would leave it.The menu system in general is very good. Its easy to find your setting and the option to use the touch screen or d-pad is nice. In fact, I think the UI is probably the best part of this camera. I found the settings I needed to change were quick to find and the flow of using the touch and the d-pad were perfect.Here is a quick example of why I am not keeping this camera besides the (in my opinion) botched WiFi uploading. I wanted to photograph my daughter holding her 1 month old cousin. I pull out the WB800f, point and.....nothing. Press the button again and great. It took the shot. Its blurry because the camera was set to auto iso and it used too low of an iso. I try a few more setting the iso to 800. Well, its almost there, still a little blurry with the camera set on P. The shutter was just a but to slow. I pop the flash up. I press the button, nothing. Press again and it takes. Overexposed because I am about 4 feet away. I back up and try and pop off several shots. Its not real fast at this. I manage to get off 3 shots. Now, just for fun, I pull out my Samsung S3 phone. Hit the camera icon and pop off about 8 shots (no flash) in the time it took me to take 3 with the WB800f. \"Ok\" you say, \"thats great\". \"But I bet the quality is better on the WB800f\". And you would be correct. But is it enough for me to justify the purchase of this camera? Not for me. I could easily get a decent 8x10 print out of either the S3 or the WB800f of my daughter and her cousin. The WB800F needed a flash to get the decent shot though. Unless I spent a bit more time bumping up the iso and messing with shutter speed.I was just a little taken back that my phone was able to pop off 8 decent shots better then this dedicated point and shoot camera. I think that says something.I didn't expect this to be a Canon G12. But I did expect it to do better then my Canon A720IS. It is not faster, it is not better image quality, its marginally better in low light as long as YOU adjust the iso up to 1600 or 3200, and the added features just don't warrant the price.If you can get this for $200 and you are ok with the limited WiFi uploading, then go for it.One thing to note is that this camera is firmware upgradable. In fact, I received a firmware/software upgrade during my brief time with the camera. I don't know what it fixed. I found nothing that it added. But I bet things like added Cloud sync options could be easily added. Perhaps they will remove the limited uploading.", "Date": "April 23, 2013"}, {"Title": "Love this camera", "Author": "Sherry123", "ReviewID": "RYP2C12KWI7CX", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "We initially purchased a Nikon but returned it because of poor picture quality and difficulty in figuring out how to use it.

I own a photography business, and lugging around a 5DmkII/Lenses got to be tiresome when just going for a night out.  I love this camera.  The zoom and image stabilization are great, and I love the full manual controls.  A lot of the complaints from other reviewers could be corrected with just a little bit of basic photography knowledge, and I don't feel like going into depth about that right now.

In addition to all the modern \"pre-programmed\" functions like HDR, panorama, Best Face, night shot, etc., it has complete control over shutter and aperture, which I use a lot.  And it's easy to set because of the well designed touch screen interface.  The pictures are sharp and vivid, given the size of the sensor and the overall cost.

Oh..best best best feature..the wifi.  I was on the ferry and got Google Android app downloaded and then it sent ALL my pictures so quickly to my phone and I posted them to facebook.

I recently took this camera on a trip through South America and it worked great in all situations. The zoom, stabilization, and low light capabilities all exceeded expectations. The sunset and waterfall settings were an added bonus. There were no condensation problems going from an air conditioned room to a humid rain forest, or shooting in a misty waterfall environment. My friends with their SLR cameras were all envious of the point-and-shoot that worked as well or better than their large cameras.", "Date": "December 2, 2013"}, {"Title": "great pictures from this compact camera", "Author": "David", "ReviewID": "R2TJLK0V18ENIS", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "I wanted a pocket camera because I know anything larger will get left at home.  Important considerations in my camera search were image quality, macro shots, low light shots, and decent zoom capabilities.  The WB800F exceeded my expectations on those points.  I'm not much interested in the video, wifi connectivity, and various special effects.  There is a 168 page instruction manual that is only available as a PDF download that does a very good job of explaining how things work.There is a red AF lamp for low light shots.  It can be turned off if desired.  This camera's low light capabilities should be great for museums and galleries that prohibit flash.The pop-up flash appears fragile and likely to likely to get broken.  The buttons for camera power and pop-up flash have nothing to protect them against accidental activation.  For that reason, I recommend against carrying this camera in a pocket or even in a soft shell case.I downloaded the firmware update.  After that update, I could no longer turn daylight saving time on or off using the touch screen but still could using the control buttons.  The update and that very minor loss of functionality may be unrelated, but I suspect they are.  Unless I discover some impairment of photographic functionality, I plan on keeping this nice little camera because it takes great pictures.  Were it not for the design missteps noted above and the botched update, I would have rated it 5 stars.Update: After a few days, the daylight saving time setting spontaneously regained functionality on the touchscreen.  When \"off\" shows on the flip card icon under DST, DST is on.  Touching the DST icon then, which makes \"off\" disappear, turns DST off.  That's my conclusion based on finding the time not adjusted after the fall back date for DST with \"off\" not displayed.  The instructions don't explain that.", "Date": "October 31, 2013"}, {"Title": "This camera rocks", "Author": "Rayman", "ReviewID": "RST6EU2PFQQ66", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "Samsung has their stuff together.

Campbell \"ncpdoug\"", "ReviewID": "R2QOPZ773V6BPT", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "My Daughter has a Samsung Galaxy camera and I like the small camera size, quality of the photos, ability to send photos via Wi-Fi and ease of use of her camera. I am currently using a Canon Power Shot SX20IS, and while it takes pretty good photos, it is clunky and very poor in low light. I did a side by side comparison of the Samsung Galaxy and the WB800F, and found few differences -  the screen size of the WB800F is 3\" VS. the Galaxy at 4.8\" (big difference in size) - the Galaxy has the \"Jelly Bean\" function and the ability to use the screen like a mini computer, and if you have a Smart Phone you can link them together somehow - They both can send photos to email, Facebook, and backup photos to your computer via Wi-Fi. One of the biggest differences of course is the price, more technology - more money. Because I am still in the semi-dark ages digitally and don't have a Smart Phone, and like the smaller size of the  WB800F I ordered the \"Red\" one through Amazon. Best price I found through a major retailer. After two days of playing with the camera the only complaint I have is that the view screen becomes hard to see in outdoor shooting. But you get that with any digital camera. I was able to configure the WI-Fi and I am sending photos to Facebook and backing up wirelessly to my computer. The biggest plus is that my Wife really likes this camera (and the color, which is on the pink side of red).

In sunlight it is very hard to see.  I had a lot of trouble and the day was partly overcast.  Also another problem that I'll try to explain briefly.I took this to my 8 yr old nephews soccer game.  So the subjects are in constant motion.  I had the zoom all the way maxed to try and get some good close ups.  Each time you take a picture it is displayed on the viewfinder for a second and then the display returns to showing what you are looking at.  In that moment the subjects are constantly moving out of frame.  So the process for the day was1. try to find subjects on screen in sunlight2. follow subjects until taking a picture3. take a picture which is displayed on screen4. lose subjects while picture is displayed5. return to step one.In short, do not plan on using this camera at sporting events.  This is my first camera without a viewfinder.  If it had a viewfinder then a lot of this could have been ignored.  Live and learn.One of the primary reasons I got this camera was to use the Samsung Smart Camera app on my phone to remotely control it.  This does work and works well.  There is a significant delay so don't think you can use the phone display for overcoming the poor screen on the camera.  Also, this app does not work with taking video.

Picture quality is good, though you have to be careful to stay still. People who are complaining about the picture quality are probably shaking the camera as they take pictures.

The remote viewfinder is great for making it possible for everyone to be in the picture, and the ability to share pics instantly is wonderful. Also, the special settings for things like \"magic frame\" and \"waterfall\" are neat and give more opportunity for creativity.The zoom is good as long as you're zooming in on something far away. I've not had much success with zooming in on things that are relatively close (say within 3-20 feet). At that range it seems to have trouble focusing.Video quality is excellent, though be aware that the default for sound is muted (weird) so make sure to change that before taking any video.Using the flash is very strange as it doesn't pop up automatically.

When I found this Samsung unit, I figured that I should give others a chance. After tried this camera few times since got it last October (2013), here is my review.The plus sides are,1. It took reasonably good pictures indoor and outdoor with sufficient light.2. Under the low light situation, it did not take that good a picture. Kind of little grainy.  This could be normal for all point-end-shoot units but this one seems more obvious than others.3. The camera is very feature rich and has very long zoom. The pictures are not super shape but acceptable. However, do not try to zoom all the way in when reviewing on the camera, most of times it is somewhat blurry when you do so.4. In addition, the touch screen control on this camera is unique and convenient. There are many features, which I have not had, chance to test it yet, the Wi-Fi sharing is one of the other reason I got this for. I will update the review when I do so.The cautions are,1. When uses this camera to shoot some sport and outdoor activities such as video family during hiking or skiing. The camera did not focus consistently while in the zoom shooting. It could start out with out of focus images or lost focus during the zoom shooting. I have not had any way to confirm what will make it out of focus on zoom. It seems random to me. My guess is the camera may not have fast enough processor to handle the zoom focusing while doing the video. Alternatively, this may be fixable by upgrading the firmware on the unit. Not sure how could it happen at all. Our three Panasonic cameras very rarely did that. May be Samsung can answer this one.2. The other annoying problem is the camera has very slow cycle time for taking pictures back to back. This slowness also exists while powering the camera up. Not sure this is due to the memory module I used (32 GB Class 10 SDHC) or just the processor is too slow (here we are again). I wish it could be fixed by some software upgrade. I am sure Samsung processor is not that bad.Overall, I rate this camera as a 3-star OK unit unless I can get the concerns above addressed.
