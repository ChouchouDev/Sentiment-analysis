{"Reviews": [{"Title": "Great Waterproof Point and Shoot", "Author": "Jamie", "ReviewID": "RF6LIHEQK7K08", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I have only used this camera underwater once so far, but it was absolutely fantastic.  I took it to the swimming pool with my daughter and niece as a test run, and got some great shots of my niece swimming underwater, and alternated with underwater shots and above the water shots.  The camera is made to slough off the water as soon as you pull it out, so the pictures out of the water don't have spots or water drops on them.  It seems like a minor thing, but it really made a huge difference.  As for being waterproof, it seemed to hold up great.  After we got home, I noticed it had some chlorine spots on a couple pictures (after I tried to use a dry cleaning cloth on it) so I soaked it in a sink full of clean water for about 5 minutes, and voila!  Perfect photos again.  I've seen some reviews that say this camera doesn't work well inside, haven't noticed a problem myself.  Pretty much every single picture I've taken with the camera has turned out with great color balance and good lighting.  I have had a couple overexpose a bit with the flash, but hey, this is a point and shoot camera, not a professional grade camera.  The overexposure can be fixed on the camera itself with the offered image editing or with editing software on your computer.We'll be taking the camera on a trip to the lake in a week, so we'll see how it holds up with the sand and murky water, but so far I am more than pleased with this little camera, especially for the price!  Can't wait to take it out and play with it some more.EDIT: Used this camera on a trip in pools, lakes, and rivers.  Had a blast.  Got some great shots in the water, above the water, canoeing, kayaking, and even in a water feature fountain thing for the kids to play in, all with no worries about water leakage.  I do recommend purchasing a floating wrist strap because the camera itself doesn't float if you drop it in deep water.  Even in the lake and river the pictures came out great, though you need to be close to your subject in dirtier/murkier water.  After a month and a couple weeks, I'd say it's already earned its keep for the price I paid.  I think we took somewhere around 1600 photos on a two week trip with this little camera, and 99% of them were fantastic.  I also bought an extra extended life battery, and with constant shooting, I did need to change the batteries about once a day.  But, I take a LOT of photos.EDIT2:  After reading some of the other reviews here, I think something needs to be said - this is NOT an expensive, professional level camera.  It isn't being sold as one, because it's not.  No, you are not going to get perfect pictures every single time.  You're not going to get perfectly clear-as-day underwater photos (although you will get some awesome ones).  This is a point-and-shoot camera that you can take in the water with you.  If you expect more than point-and-shoot quality, you should not buy this camera.  But understand you will spend more money on something else.  For the average user, it is an absolutely fantastic camera for the price.  You can take it anywhere, it fits in your POCKET (how nice is that?) and it will stand up to being dropped, getting wet, getting cold, etc.  Take it on your family vacation without worrying about it.  Now try to do that with a $3000 professional camera.  Also, for people saying the quality sucks, I have blown up some of the photos from this camera to 16x20 prints and hung them on the wall.  I certainly can't tell they were taken with a $140 camera, and neither can anyone else.", "Date": "July 10, 2013"}, {"Title": "Don't know much about cameras but I like this one...", "Author": "Mike Jacobs", "ReviewID": "R1Z46PJIYPDV9O", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "UPDATE 2: Just noticed another issue. The flash sometimes causes a bit of reflection the color of my finger along the right side of the imate, evidently becuase my fingers are too close (to the flash). This isn't an issue, I just move my fingers a bit. Good thing I preview work-pictures, though. I can't tell you how much I am appreciating the water and dust-proofing in this SE Florida monsoon season! No change in the rating.UPDATE 1: Since purchasing I've used this quite a bit for work and personal photos. I still love the camera - I've been able to take pics in rain, around water and with a 4 year old hanging all over me without worrying about dust, water or dropping it. However, there are a couple of issues I haven't seen in other reviews: (1) the lens is easily \"dirtied\" by a finger print when you take this out of your pocket (no cover), and (2) I have to be more careful about taking photos in the direction of the sun or I sometimes get a big glare-streak... don't know why my other cameras didn't have this problem but it sometimes requires two hands (one to block the sun). These issues have not changed my rating.ORIGINAL REVIEW: Lots of camera-geek analysis here, and from what I read Panasonic meets my criteria - fast cycle after shooting, wide angle, durable and mainstream (\"reliable\") manufacturer. I mostly take photos for work, and any modern camera is satisfactory for family use.This has a wider angle than my Canon PowerShot, which I am replacing, and no moving parts. I can shoot in the rain and carry it in my shirt pocket, neither of which are feasible with the Canon. The unit is \"closed\" so that I won't get construction dust or lint inside the lenses, which is why I need to replace my Canon.Other than that, it's just a nice camera that I can get wet or drop, with all the usual bells and whistles (90% of which I'll never use). The price:value ratio is very good for my needs.", "Date": "February 13, 2013"}, {"Title": "Testing waterproof cameras", "Author": "Sephwin", "ReviewID": "R7U0XXR4XFAWV", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I bought 3 waterproof cameras to take with me on vacation to the Bahamas (Used the Consumers Report to pick the cameras). The Nikon Coolpix AW110, Olympus TG2, and Panasonic Lumix FS5. I like the Nikon best for it's true color in and out of water, Olympus for the functions, and Lumix for it's all around used. I found that these three cameras works great if you follow the instructions, like going too deep underwater (Cause to leak and stop the cameras from working) or opening the seal to download your picture without making sure that the cameras have the same temperature as the surrounding environments (this can cause fogging in the lens). Always clean the cameras after used. After my testing, I let my friends barrow the cameras for their used to the beach, pools, snowboarding, and military deployment. The verdict is that my friend love the Lumix most. Great pictures in and out of water. Rugged, the camera survive being drop (snow, water, mud, sand, and even concrete less than 5 ft.). The price also help, it is the cheapest of the three.

The camera worked well and took some good pictures in and out of the water, as long as you used the normal optical zoom.  My only complaint would be that the Intelligent zoom does not work very well, it's a bit grainy, especially in low light and under water.  Saying that it has an 8X zoom is a bit misleading, since it is not a true optical zoom.  Had no problems with leakage and we snorkeled for a couple of hours.  My husband has an older model that has manual modes and a lot more picture options.  Next time I would go with a higher end model to have those options.  This camera is very small which can make it a bit hard to hold on to and the movie mode button is so small it is hard to push, especially if you had larger fingers.  All in all I like the camera, but some small changes could make it much better.", "Date": "June 23, 2013"}, {"Title": "Self Destructs", "Author": "David White", "ReviewID": "RHKH51DDX41IP", "Overall": "1.0", "Content": "I purchased this camera for its advertised ability to take underwater photos.After following the waterproofing instructions to the letter it did take threeunderwater pictures then promptly died.

Olson", "ReviewID": "R2ZM0M64ZKGCR3", "Overall": "3.0", "Content": "I was really excited to receive this camera prior to going on a vacation to Playa Del Carmen, Mexico. On first use, it was great! I took a lot of pictures in the LAX airport and upon arrival to Cancun (where we flew in). It worked great. Powered on fast, fast shutter speed, fast focusing, and it took good quality pictures as I found out once downloading them to my laptop.I used the camera in the pool and at the beach. Waterproof? Absolutely! I can only attest to its water integrity to about 3-4 feet, but it passed with flying colors. No leaks! Floats well with the floating wrist straps.The second day of our trip I noticed a slight fogging of the lens on the inside. I had read that once you open the case (you have to do download pics) you can allow moisture in. It's very hot and humid in Playa Del Carmen so that's likely what happened. From this point on the camera was useless for the trip. I wasn't going to hold it against the camera because that's just the way it goes once moisture gets into something. But my sister bought the same camera for this trip and she never opened the case the entire time. Her's also began to fog up (not as severe as mine) and that's what really worried me. Waterproof cameras are awesome, but when they fog up, that's that! You can get strips to put inside the latch to absorb the moisture, but I didn't have that at the time.I was still set on keeping the camera but I also discovered later that the video was a bit grainy. I thought it must have been set to a lower setting, but it was full quality. I have a Casio EX-S10 that takes much better quality video (and audio) than this camera and it has less lines of resolution.So anyway...the camera went back today because I don't feel it lived up to the advertisement. I'm pretty fair in my opinions when it comes to my gadgets, so I gave an honest assessment of this product. It's a good camera, and the fogging could probably be corrected with adding strips to absorb the moisture, but the video was the deal breaker for me.3 out of 5 stars.

I had everything packed for my trip to Australia and had not done enough homework to warrant buying a waterproof camera.

This camera lived up to and exceeded all expectations. It never leaked. The battery time was fine. The photos and videos were spectacular.

I'm not sure if salt water is the problem, but the battery terminals were heavily corroded.I just returned from a trip to St. Croix. The camera did not make it through day #1. Again, I followed the instructions precisely and the seal did not hold. I do not recommend buying this camera.

I have been taking pictures underwater for sometime, so I know everything was checked and double-checked.  I called Panasonic when I got  back and they told me to expect a claim number and label in my email in 48hrs.  well, 48 came and went.  I called in again, and they told me the plant, or whomever was in Texas would not issue a label.  I would have to pay to have it sent to be inspected.  I requested to speak with a supervisor since this was a 3 month old camera.  They said someone would call.  That was last month.

It was purchased for a cruise where I had planned a couple of snorkeling excursions. It performed just fine...not the best pictures I've ever taken, but it did the job for very little money. I'd never had the illusion that I'd be a master underwater photographer, so I wasn't disappointed with the pictures I got.  Some were fantastic and others were total crap...it totally depended on the light and my (lack of) ability to manage to stay in one spot and not be tossed around by the current.PROS:Cost...hello...I got this camera for at least sixty bucks less (thanks Amazon) than it was being sold in local shops or on the cruise ship itself.Size...it's tiny...so tiny that it fit in the pocket of my very small bathing suit.Picture Quality...on land it did a fine job for an affordable point and shooter. In fact, I was very surprised at the quality of some of my shots. Given the right light and circumstance the pictures turned out beautifully.Water Resistance....that's right. I didn't say 'water proof'. Nothing is water proof if you can open it up. While I did have one instance where there was a tiny bit of fog on the inside of the lens...I just opened it up and let it dry out while I ate lunch. Presto! Clear again. But, otherwise...no problem while being underwater for a couple hours.Cuteness...It probably doesn't count to many people...but, this darn camera is a cutie pie. I was proud to pull it out and it always caught somebody's eye.CONS:Picture Quality...yep...it's under Pros too. It's probably not the camera's fault but I must have taken a hundred pictures underwater and I ended up keeping about fifteen of them. The clarity of the pictures wasn't the best...but, again, that's probably due to the fact that I was underwater that isn't as clear as the air.  (duh.)Software...the photo viewing/editing software that Panasonic offers is crap. I ended up just moving all the pics from the SD card over to my Kodak easyshare software.SD Card....this camera uses a regular sized SD card and not the micro DS card that I already had.  But, I solved that problem by buying an adapter. When that is number three on my CONS list...you know it's not a big problem, right? The camera did happen to handle my 32 gb high speed micro sd card beautifully....no drag at all. Pics were saved super quick and I could take another shot in a second.That's it...I would really recommend this camera to anyone going on a vacation when they don't want to risk using their phone or a nicer camera.  It worked well enough underwater and just fine above water.  I'll probably still use my phone as my every day shooter and my digital SLR for other stuff.

This video of river rafting was taken on February 25, 2014 in Ocho Rios, Jamaica. The battery lasted the entire safari - about an hour and a half, but then it was dead. The original sound was in mono but was cleaned up and then synthesized to stereo. The video was not processed - what you see is what the camera took. I had the camera mounted on a bobber which I held in my hand. The bobber was attached to my wrist with a tether.One thing to be aware of with this camera is that when taking video, you may hear clicking sounds in the audio - which is why I gave it a four star rating instead of five. The clicks are the sound of the aperture adjusting to changing light conditions. This is not a defect. It's mentioned in the instruction manual. However, if the sound you're recording is very loud, you probably won't notice the clicks.", "Date": "April 16, 2014"}, {"Title": "RUN AWAY: You get what you pay for!", "Author": "Pcitiyank", "ReviewID": "R3HWH9IF7VCLAD", "Overall": "1.0", "Content": "In spite of reading and following instructions, this has leaked since the first time I used it in The Galapagos.

This time however, I wanted to take underwater photos as well.  Did some research and underwater housing for D7100 was expensive so I thought this was a good time to buy a secondary camera that is small, waterproof, captures decent video for under $200.  So I did some extensive research and initially waterproof cameras from Nikon and Canon came to mind but since this was my secondary camera I wanted to keep it below $200.  If this was my primary camera, I would of spent little more and would of likely purchased Canon, Nikon and even Olympus in the price range of $200-$400.First of all, this is my first point and shoot camera and I am quite surprised by the image quality, especially for a camera that I spent in the low $100. I want to emphasize at this price point because it's unfair to compare a low $100 camera to $1200 Nikon with a $500 lens.  Unfortunately, when we first arrived at Cancun, it was cloudy and raining.  So the pictures taken on the beach are somewhat grainy (I am carefully viewing the photos as I write on a computer screen), but the next days were sunny and the photos quality are somewhat comparable to my Nikon DSLR.  So the overall image quality is there, especially something that is very small to carry around and that can easily slide into your pocket.  Pictures taken inside the hotel during the daytime came out great.  At night, pictures taken with flash came out pretty clear.Afterwards, I went kayaking and submerged this camera underneath the water.  With the large LCD display, I was able to see the ocean bottom from the kayak.  Took several pictures and they came out OK most likely because the water was somewhat murky.  So I really couldn't test the image quality of underwater pictures because the water was not clear.  Then I changed to video mode, and using the default mode the video came out somewhat grainy for both out of water and under water.  I really didn't have time to read the manual and change any settings since the camera came a day before our vacation.  But I really didn't expect high quality video like my HD Canon camcorder.  According to the manual, it captures 720P video.Overall I took over 450 pictures and about 7 minutes of video using a 16GB SDHC memory card and used up only 3.33 GB of memory (approximately 11.5 GB of free space), and fully charged camera about two times during my three days stay at Cancun.  Unless you are taking hundreds of pictures in a day, I do not believe a second battery is necessary.  In the default video mode, 16GB of SDHC memory gave approximately 30 minutes of video recording time.Sure it would of been nice to have a camera that will take better pictures during low light or better quality video, but for the price I really can't complain.  If you want a waterproof camera with high quality video, I would recommend looking at other waterproof cameras with video capability.  But for me, I was quite surprised by this Panasonic underwater camera and it definitely makes an excellent secondary camera  that I can easily carry around.  So out of 450 images, I would say that over 95 percent of the images are keepers that I can print although not perfect.  Oh by the way, the camera focus is pretty fast for a point and shoot.  Obviously, the waterproof works great, otherwise I would of have no underwater pictures, but if there is one improvement (not a complaint) it would have to be the video quality.  My wife and my kids love this camera and I will likely report back once it gets more usage.", "Date": "March 3, 2014"}, {"Title": "Great Waterproof Camer", "Author": "Jerry VanOort", "ReviewID": "R1PNRFGH4ZMXF9", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I bought this for a vacation to Mexico so I could take photos in the pool and ocean and around sand.  It performed flawlessly and allowed me to take some great photos.  Just make sure you allow the camera to adjust to the different microclimates as the lens can easily fog up when you get near the ocean.  You just need to give it a few minutes to acclimate and the fog will go away.  I would also make sure that you read the instruction carefully on how to properly maintain the watertight door.  The video is sub-par at best which was a little disappointing but far from being a deal breaker.

We followed all the instructions about closing it properly, only taking it in the water for 1 hour, rinsing it after salt water use, etc. And for the first five days this camera gave us great pictures and we were really impressed how this little camera can work so well AND be waterproof. If our vacation had been 5 days long this would be a 5 star review.On the 6th day when we got in the water the LCD screen started to fog from the inside. So no way to wipe it off. It's not water inside, probably just air with a different temperature that starts to condensate. This was only annoying but at least it still took pictures. A few minutes later the lens started to fog on the inside. Now it was useless because the pictures taken were foggy. After 15 minutes in the water the fog disappeared (probably because the temperature inside got equal to the water temperature). From that point on the camera was ok when outside the water, but would get foggy every time it was put in the water and if we got lucky after maybe 15-20 minutes it would clear up, but not always. As soon as the fog disappears it's still ok to use and on land you wouldn't notice a thing.Summary: Great camera, but if you really want to use it for underwater pictures, consider it a disposable camera.

The excellent way it's doing it's job right now, it may be the only one I ever own. Delivery was fast and the package came in great shape!The camera is a neat little thing. It weighs almost nothing at all and feels sturdy to the touch. For the price tag being so reasonable, I think this was worth every penny and then some! At first glance, I thought the buttons on the camera were in no way going to stop water from leaching into the camera! However, that misconception was blown away when I took it to the beach for some great snapshots of underwater seaweed. There were no problems whatsoever.  I put it on it's side on top of a towel for about 30 minutes and it was dry and ready to go! I made note to keep the battery hatch closed during drying due to reading reviews stating that doing so may fog the lens.I stayed at the beach taking various pictures using all kinds of options and software built into the camera. The options to edit photos kept me so amused that I missed several great potential shots! As it got darker, I switched to night sky option and took some shots of the horizon after the last bit of sun sank below. The shots came out gorgeous! Better than what I expected. It captured the stars that were barely coming out as if they were out in full effect. The camera picked up stars I couldn't even see!I later had trouble keeping my hands steady enough so I put the TS25 on a tripod. By this time, it was complete night. The moon was full and there were no city lights within miles. The shots were even more amazing with the tripod. For what I consider a budget camera, this thing took very nice shots of the night sky. There's no trouble telling which constellations are which from the photos.Overall, great product!", "Date": "January 20, 2014"}, {"Title": "Great underwater camera for cheap", "Author": "llauren", "ReviewID": "R81RORR1DMGE1", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "Bought this camera in August 2013 for a vacation to the Florida Keys.

We added a lanyard on to the camera so we would not lose the camera in the rough waves as it does not float.

Both models I received suffered from the same problem. I've given up now and will choose another brand.Blue/purple vertical lines appear in the recorded HD video. They are most prominent in lower light scenarios with solid color backgrounds (such as indoors, against a wall). The lines are not present in the pictures, or in VGA video. I returned the first camera, hoping it was fluke, but the second version suffered from the same problem, just in a slightly different location. This is probably poor quality control, and I'm betting most of the other users have the same problem, they just haven't noticed it yet. I've tried to upload a video, but Amazon's video compression will probably remove the lines. The most prominent line appears in the very center of the frame. Again, this is visible on ALL HD videos, it's just harder to make out when the background is busy.As to the picture quality, it's what you'd expect from a camera this small. Photos are adequate in daylight, but suffer in low light scenarios (not much better looking than my phone).Video quality looks overly smoothed, probably from heavy handed noise filtering.I cannot attest to the ruggedness or waterproofing of the camera, since it was defective right out of the box.TL;DR - HD video recording is defective. Photos are ok with enough light. Would not buy.", "Date": "July 17, 2013"}, {"Title": "water proof great", "Author": "Jamie M.

Since this one had a Leica lens I imagined picture quality would be good, but I was completely wrong.Pictures without flash were dull and pictures with flash were ultra bright and some of them came out blurry even though they were still pictures. In addition, the water damage warning continuously pops up (ALL the time!) even though the battery cap is securely closed and locked. Finally, the monitor is super grainy and VERY slow to respond, so when you move the camera from one side to another you get a blurry and choppy image until you stop moving the camera.

Probably taken 1,000+ pictures.We have a Panasonic Lumix DMC\u2011ZS19 and love it.  So when this camera was on sale we decided to purchase it for two reasons.i) waterproof - we are at the beach a lotii) tough - have two small kids who like to pretend to use the camera.Pros-The camera is compact and tough.  We've had several small drops with it without any problems.-It is waterproof, and it is nice to take it into the water. Just be sure to buy a Float in case you get hit by a big wave and drop it!Cons-the camera shows damage quickly.  We've dropped all our cameras many times and this one scratches very easily (disappointing considering it is \"tough\" camera.-the picture quality is quite poor.  Our ZS19 camera is only 14MP and its pictures are way higher quality.  Even our old Sony T100 camera takes more vibrant photos (It's only 8MP).  This TS25 camera seems to struggle with the whiteness/brightness in pictures (parts of picture seem too bright) and when you scale 1:1 details (like leaves on trees) are blotchy (poor sharpness).  This doesn't happen on the ZS19 camera we have or our old Sony T100.  I even went so far as to contact Panasonic customer support and sent identical shot comparative pictures of this vs the ZS19 & T100.  After many emails/tests they said to send it back for repair.  Instead I got a replacement through Amazon and compared the two TS25 cameras and pictures from both cameras were the same!  Glad I didn't pay to return it to Panasonic.We are going to keep the camera.  It serves its purpose of being compact, durable and water poof.  If we want nice quality pictures though, we definitely do not use this camera.", "Date": "September 5, 2013"}, {"Title": "BEST CAMERA I'VE EVER HAD!!!", "Author": "Gloria", "ReviewID": "R11BOTIGZSPMP5", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "This camera is amazing!!! It takes clear photos & video and has very good zoom and macro for what it is. The best part, in my opinion, is its ability to go underwater, and it takes amazing pics under there, too!

Have had a regular Lumix for years, so I thought their underwater would be fine.  I was SO WRONG. All my underwater shots have poor sharpness and too much blue, no matter what setting I use: Autofocus, Sports, Underwater, Advanced Underwater -- they all gave me the same lousy pictures. I am so disappointed, since I am now in Roatan, Honduras with an underwater camera that takes lousy underwater pics. It's almost like the settings don't work, since all the pics are poor. Even the regular outdoors in good sunlight are not sharp.  I'm hoping Amazon will do something to help me recover from this, even though I've used the camera. I'm going for an Olympus with the next one.

I like that the camera can take some abuse without damage. I have taken some stills in very low light conditions, and the results were better than I expected. I like being able to switch to video with one button. That is a great feature. I haven't tried the panoramic view and time lapse photography yet, but I intend to as soon as my SD card arrives.I have just a couple of cons: The buttons are tiny and a little difficult for me to use. I would like to see a larger on/off button. I have an older model Panasonic DMC-FP1 and to turn it on all I have to do is slide down the lens cover. I understand that this feature would be hard to implement on a waterproof camera.Also, my first few pictures showed my finger covering part of the lens.

I am going to Mexico in March and will see how it does under water at that point. I'm pretty happy with this camera at this point. It has been sharp, so simple to use, and it is slim enough that I can carry it with me every where I go. I don't have to worry about my nieces and nephews snagging it to snap some shots because it is durable. I have a canon g9 as well and love this one 100 times more than that point and shoot.
