I Received this camera and have been playing with it and enjoying it for it's purpose. Let me state this, I own a Canon 5D Mark III as well, so I can only speak on my intentions and reasoning for wanting the Eos-M. I had no intentions of buying this camera as a back up body, nor would this be the camera I would recommend for others who are in the market for one. However, image quality wise, it could be. If you've made the Canon investment in gear, and could use something a little more light weight, sort of pocket friendly, and portable that has the capability to be used with your other canon gear.. It's a no brainer. This camera to me is the Hobbyist/enthusiast Canon gear owners good, to best friend.The Good: I love the image quality, size, and build quality of the camera and even the 22mm itself is a much better build then expected. It doesn't feel cheap. The touchscreen is pretty good and responsive, if you don't mind a few prints on the screen trying to assist the focusing. Also I love the relief of not carrying my battery gripped 5D around with me for all of the smallest things, and missing something worth capturing because of it. This camera has been a blast, and I've worn it around my neck on several occasions and even the people with me haven't noticed.The Bad: Slow maneuvering around the menus, as there are limited physical buttons and no turn dial (But this may get faster as you get use to the touchscreen). No built in flash (When this camera is said to target those coming from point and shoot cameras), No view finder (But after a couple of shots.. I wasn't missing it), And no direct lens mount Ef-s or EF (and mainly this is because of the outrageous price for the adapter). But all of this is tolerable... Sort of. I wont complain about the auto focus speed as to me, it's really not that bad. I have seen faster, and even faster focus speeds on this camera alone. But then again, I use a 85mm 1.2L quite a bit on my Mark III and that lens can almost make any focus speed seem fast.I did purchased the 16GB Eye-Fi card and use it to transfer images straight to my cellphone for quick editing if needed, and uploading to any social network services I use. I have no idea why it did not cross someones mind at Canon, to include wifi and/or Gps, when I've have heard time and time again about one of the excuses for not having a built in EVF was that this camera should attract those who are familiar with taking cellphone images.In the end, a built in Viewfinder, wifi, gps, flash and a cheaper if not free lens adapter would have been nice. But even so, I am happy with my purchase, and I've read enough to understand its purpose or my reasoning for wanting one, and have actually been more impressed then what I've originally expected. I do not think anyone would be in their right mind to purchase this camera for sports photography, and if you've taking pictures with almost any modern smart phone today, the focus speed may never be a issue to you. If you already own or are familiar with a Canon DSLR, this camera will feel right at home with the options and setup. And if this is a new world to you, you might want to read the manual, or watch a video to get yourself familiar first. Great buy for me!!!**UPDATE** 7-3-13 I Still love this camera just as much as the day I got it, and has been a very solid performer overall. The biggest gripe about the camera from others was the auto focus speed in which has recently been corrected via v2.0.. And for me was the sun glare on the screen was a slight disadvantage while using the camera outside, (which could be fixed if the camera had a view finder), but I just added a non glare screen protector, and raised my LCD brightness to fix and works great for me.From my personal experiences that I've had since owning this camera, the slight auto focus problem has not made me feel any less different about it, as it was not that bad.The consistent color contrast, color balance and image quality has never been better, and have shocked me on many occasions. This camera is a very capable and solid performer for what my intentions were, and quite a few people have purchased it after seeing a few uses, and images i've taken with it. Now with the update, there is no denying how good and fun this little camera is, and have definitely increased my personal uses and longevity with this camera. Thanks Canon, the overall build, and image quality is nothing short of awesome. I can't wait to see how they will out do themselves with the next Eos-M camera.", "Date": "November 5, 2012"}, {"Title": "Absolutely Best Compact Camera, Period!", "Author": "R. Sonmez", "ReviewID": "R1USAZ1P78MR5B", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "I have been on the market for a while to buy a mirrorless compact DSLR with APS-C sensor. I bought a Sony NEX 5 camera (before this little Canon released.) I loved the compactness and snappy performance of NEX. I was able take some good photos with that. Yet my photos always lacked this magical look that my semi-professional photographer friends' photos have. I tried to play with the camera settings extensively on my NEX to get what other cameras are producing but I rarely get something that is even remotely close to that. Of course they were using these really expensive cameras with absolutely amazing prime lenses but I still thought that my $700 NEX should have been able to at least be satisfying. Well, it wasn't. At least with the lenses it came with. I didn't want to start investing in NEX prime lenses (which I tried and loved btw) as I thought it was an expensive proposition to be stuck at NEX format. Then I started searching to find a better yet more affordable camera.....I have tried a number of cameras; All Sony NEX Cameras (good performance if you have good lenses), Olympus four third cameras(small sensor), Fuji X series(super crazy expensive camera and lenses but regardless great cameras), Nikon (small sensor-lack of lenses), Panasonic four thirds (small sensor) and some more. That's when I wanted to give the Canon EOS-M a try despite all those really bad professional reviews that bashed the camera mostly due to the autofocus problems. Ohh boy, thank god I gave this camera a chance. In an instant, right out of the package I was able to start taking photos almost like my friends' photos... Vibrant, gorgeous colors with satisfyingly beautiful bookeh.  Super zippy performance with amazing lens. Really though, the lens that the camera came with (22mm f2.0) is the superhero. It instantly gives you the \"professional photo look\" with its bright aperture at f2. This what gives you those beautiful blurry backgrounds. No other compact camera comes with a lens this bright and wide angle. Nothing even close. Trust me when I say this but the difference between this lens and the other lenses that the other cameras come with is just night and day. You would have to pay another $300 to thousands to get some prime lenses with an f2 aperture at least.I bought a new lens adapter which is $99 on ebayCanon EOS M Mount Adapter and a 50mm f1.8  prime lens (an all time classic) which is just $121 Canon EF 50mm f/1.8 II Camera Lens.With the adapter now I can tap into the extensive Canon lens portfolio as well.Touch screen is not a novelty at all, it really is the best thing ever. It is just a bliss to be able to touch the screen and focus something in the background or foreground without moving the camera. You don't have to center the object to focus at all. Wherever the object is, just click on and there it is. This is particularly helpful when you are shooting video with camera fixed where you focus foreground and background as you wish. Super artistic, almost movie quality video is possible.Autofocus is not a huge problem at all with the new firmware. In general, autofocus always becomes somewhat slower when you have a bright large aperture like this lens, unless your camera and your lens are both no less than $1,500. That being said, I really never had an instance where I thought I was having a problem with autofocus. The camera is able to focus pretty fast. (see the update below)You can never complain when you get all this for $299. I am not sure if this is still available for that price but even at $500 it would be a steal.UPDATE: Ok, after using the camera for a couple of months, I have become a little less enthused about it. Yes it still is a great camera but after my baby is born I realized that autofocus can become quite a pain, sometimes.... Autofocus is generally acceptable with the 22mm stm lens but with the other lenses (read, non-stm) it is a quite bit of a challange especially under low lighr or contrast light conditions. So it is 4 star review now...", "Date": "July 23, 2013"}, {"Title": "HUH??", "Author": "S. Gabbay", "ReviewID": "R1HYTUX5U1R872", "Overall": "2.0", "Content": "I really really really really really wanted to love this camera.**UPDATE**I am a professional.  When I saw the EOS M and I was excited that it's a small portable multi-use camera that I could use as a carry-around as well as for work as a back-up camera using the lens coupler.  The perfect addition to a mobile rig, the EOS M would be great as a second camera for shooting interviews when attached to my lenses.When I bought it and held it, I was even more excited.  It's built EXTREMELY well, feels solid, great finish.  It's a camera I really like to touch.Once I turned it on, this was the first Canon that didn't quite feel like a Canon.  The interface felt rough.  Just finding how to set it in manual focus mode required reading the user's manual (and multiple menu pages as mentioned by other reviewers).  The LCD touch-screen interface and lack of physical dials (especially for AF/M focusing) makes it more difficult to add an LCD loupe to the camera which would be amazing.Snapped a couple of photos and they looked beautiful (Hey, the 3-year old 7D sensor is still magnificent) and the lens looked sharp with beautiful bokeh.  Color was well rendered.But what's this... Brrrrzzzzzzzz..... YUP.  I can clearly and loudly hear the autofocus motor while shooting a movie, especially during quiet scenes.  Yeah ok, you're supposed to use manual focus for movies.  Agreed.  But not when the camera specs claim it has continuos focus for movies.  The motor is LOUD.  This is a strange first entry by canon.  I REALLY WANT TO LIKE IT....  Not happy face.  Not sad face.  More a perplexed face.  After flipping through the manual I saw a mention about this.  Canon suggests using an external mic rather than the built-in stereo mics.I loved seeing photos of a 70-200mm lens attached to this thing.  Then I thought... wait, I can't press this camera against my face to balance its weight.  Holding that big lens 6 inches away from my face to shoot would set my whole center of gravity off.  I really do miss having a viewfinder so I can stabilize the camera.Main disappointment was at night, casually shooting in a restaurant, where the focusing speed was beyond unacceptable.  A full 3-4 seconds of focus hunting, WITH focus assist on, before it would fire the shutter.  On my second night of ownership, I left the camera at home and that's a pretty bad sign as I love really diving into new gear.  The terrible low light focus of the Fuji X100 seemed acceptable compared to the EOS M.  Back when I got the X100, I loved using it so much I practically went to bed with it.  As much as I hate to admit it, the EOS M felt like it fired more slowly than my S100, even during the day.  That shouldn't be so.  Not at $800.Then... $70 for a tiny battery?  $200 for the coupler? These are Pro prices... without Pro performance.  Me: perplexed face.I ended up returning the camera.  Some of these issues may be fixed with a firmware update, others will need Canon to really study their competition.A bit bummed- my first real disappointment in a Canon product.", "Date": "November 1, 2012"}, {"Title": "Camera takes fantastic picture - if you can get it to focus in time", "Author": "W. Kulhanek", "ReviewID": "R175YCWSAW0IMS", "Overall": "2.0", "Content": "I picked this camera up on my last trip to Japan 3 days after it came out there. In Japan they only sold a kitchen sink bundle for the first few weeks which included the body, 22m lens, 18-55m lens, EF Lens adapter and the Speedlite 90EX flash.This camera takes fantastic pictures! But there are two shortcomings that are incredibly annoying. First of all the camera takes a good second (or more) to focus - for a camera this expensive this is almost unacceptable. My Canon G11 was focusing faster... Second there is a (beautiful) touch screen on the back of the camera. This touchscreen can also be used as a shutter - as in: touch the touchscreen to take a picture. Now the product manager/developer who decided it was a good idea to put the control to enable/disable the touch shutter onto the touchscreen needs to be fired. When I walked around various Japanese cities with the camera around my neck it happened with regularity that the camera would bump up against my body, turn the touch shutter on and then continue to take pictures every time it bumped against my body. SERIOUSLY ANNOYING with no way to disable. I really hope there will be a firmware update to fix this (there is a menu setting to enable/disable the touch screen shutter - I have no idea why the additional control on the screen itself).When doing post processing of my photos I did notice that I had quite a few of them with the focus slightly off. Guess the automatic metering didn't always pick the right spot to focus on - but then again I could have easily fixed that by using spot metering.Now various other reviews (e.g. on Engadget) mentioned the missing mode dial compared to DSLRs or even G-series cameras. To be honest I haven't missed it that much during two weeks of intense shooting.Also I haven't scratched the surface on what this camera can actually do - but I did find that for taking HDR pictures the built-in mode only really works for static scenes. With moving objects the camera can't really build a great HDR - so if there are people in a scene it's definitely better to process manually on the computer.There really isn't much to say about the two lenses or the flash that came with the camera - they do the trick. And I have no EF lenses to try the converter with.Added 2013/05/08:I just returned from another trip to Asia and after this trip I would no longer recommend this camera. It simply doesn't focus fast enough to capture things quickly - e.g. when driving in a car and trying to take photos of the outside. Also I can't tell you how often my wife (or anyone else) ended up in my frame because it took more than 1 second to focus and take the shot. I know that's more \"snapshot\" photography but nevertheless I'd like to have that option.Added 2013/06/27Canon just released a firmware update 2.02 that claims to increase focusing times 2x - 3x in OneShot AF mode. I just applied it and within the room I'm in it seems to do what it says. Now I'll have to test the new firmware in the wild to see if it makes this camera more suited to my style of photography.", "Date": "October 18, 2012"}, {"Title": "A great camera, particularly for existing Canon DSLR owners", "Author": "Leilehua Maly", "ReviewID": "RY85BESH13M8D", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "Here are my two cents on the EOS M + 22mm f/2 STM kit lens. I'll point out that I'm a semi-pro, and I bought this camera as a more casual/portable alternative to my 5D Mark III and heavier L glass.The main thing I will say about the EOS M is that it's just plain fun. It's portable, it takes great pictures, and has all the pro features I need to give me the confidence that, in a bind, I could leave my big camera at home and come back with perfectly usable shots.  Plus, there's just something liberating about using a more casual camera...I love my 5D III, but I seem to set higher expectations for myself when using that camera and it's nice to be able to just get out and have fun.Anyway, here are some thoughts on the EOS M:  1. Auto-focus - If any one thing could be blamed for the less-than-stellar reviews of the EOS-M, this is it. When I first heard about how slow the AF was, I immediately decided that this camera wasn't for me.  It made me think of my crummy old cellphone camera, which would hunt for a few seconds in low light then finally take a blurry shot.  I'll say that while the AF can be slow, when it *does* lock -- unlike the cell camera -- you WILL get a great shot.  Furthermore, you can maximize AF performance by using the \"FlexiZone - Single\" mode, setting the AF Operation to \"ONE SHOT AF\", and disabling Continuous AF. I'd also suggest leaving the \"Touch Shutter\" option disabled, but that may just be a personal preference. [Note: Supposedly the MagicLantern folks are working on homebrew firmware that will fix some of the AF issues, but I would not recommend buying any camera based on the vague promise of some future update.]  2. Image Quality - Image quality is great, but it's no 5D Mark III.  If you're expecting 5D3 level images from this then you're in the wrong place, but with some care it can produce shots a pro would be proud of.  What I noticed most when compared against the higher end cameras would be contrast range and saturation.  Some of this could just be the lens, but I haven't yet had a chance to put on something like my 24-70 f/2.8L or 50mm f/1.2L. I plan to do that soon and will update the review with my results.  If you shoot in RAW you'll be able to overcome a good portion of the contrast/saturation problems with Photoshop and CameraRaw, but even so I've had to be more careful with blown highlights (particularly specular highlights) on the EOS M.  3. Video Quality - I'm generally impressed with the video performance. That said, expect to use manual focus if you want anything near professional-level video. I haven't tried this with a focus peaking monitor yet, but I'm not even sure the camera would be fully functional after losing the touchscreen.  4. ISO Performance - The ISO performance is pretty good. Again, it's no 5D Mark III but up to at least ISO 1600 it's not something you can't fix in Photoshop.  My biggest complaint with ISO is the fact that you can't seem to use anything finer than full stop increments.  Am I missing something?  5. Touch screen - I had mixed feelings about losing the majority of my physical buttons and switches in favor of a touch screen, but it is growing on me.  The settings I use the most are all easily available via the screen (shooting mode, aperture/shutter speed/ISO, exposure compensation) or through physical buttons (menu, quick menu, exposure lock, drive mode, etc.).  One thing that took me an embarrassingly long time to figure out was how to zoom on the image preview screen...using my fingers to pinch and zoom seemed completely foreign coming from the 5D3, but it works well.  6. No view finder - This doesn't bother me as much as I thought it would, but I do embarrass myself by occasionally lifting the M to my eye.  7. Features - I love the fact that, feature wise, this is very similar to Canon's high-end DSLRs. I had this little camera attached to a wireless strobe system in my home studio, and it just worked.  The user interface was familiar, the settings and options were similar, and the results were fantastic.  It's also got all the shooting modes (M/Av/Tv/P) that a pro would expect, plus the full auto and \"scene intelligent auto\" settings that allow you to hand the camera off to a random passerby to get a family shot for you while on vacation.  8. Ergonomics - The camera is small and light, and I can stick it in my jacket pocket and \"almost\" forget that it's there.  That said, the small size makes me wonder how easy it will be to hold with heavier glass attached via the EF/EF-S adapter. I'll provide info on that when I get around to it as well.In short, as long as you don't come into the game expecting pro-level performance and quality, you will not be disappointed.  It does exactly what I got it for: it gives me a way to leave my 25 lbs. camera bag at home on occasion, while still delivering great shots that I'm not embarrassed to share online.  Plus, for someone who's already invested a great deal of money on Canon glass this makes even more sense. Sure the AF is slow, there aren't many dedicated lenses for the M mount (yet), and it's not a replacement for a high-end camera...but I didn't go in expecting any of that, and so I came out happy.UPDATEI've had a chance to use some of my EF lenses on this camera, and here are my results:  1. Canon 16-35mm f/2.8L - Good focal length range for a cropped sensor, AF speed comparable to the 22mm f/2 STM.  2. Canon 50mm f/1.2 - AF speed comparable to the 22mm f/2 STM, aperture opens all the way to f/1.2 if you were wondering.  3. Tamron 18-270 Di II VC PZD - AF is unusably slow, don't bother.  4. Canon 18-135 f/3.5-5.6 IS STM - A great pairing with the EOS M, this is on my camera 90% of the time.  5. Canon 100mm f/2.8L IS Macro - The EOS M is great for macro. The cropped sensor gives you that extra bit of reach, and the small size and light weight make it easier to maneuver into tight spaces.  I'm having a bunch of fun walking around outside my house with this setup.", "Date": "March 20, 2013"}, {"Title": "A compact DSLR alternative for bumping up your image quality", "Author": "Skiing311", "ReviewID": "R2NQ5XKFBM8H9S", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "I am writing this review from the perspective of an enthusiast who was looking to upgrade from point-and-shoot cameras (Canon G-Series for serious shots and a Canon ELPH for pocketable convenience) to something with a larger sensor and better lenses. I started my research pretty convinced about upgrading to a DSLR (preferably a 60D); however, I ultimately decided on the EOS M for a couple reasons:1) The majority of my photos are taken while hiking/backpacking. I just couldn't reconcile the fact that I would have to lug around such a heavy and large camera in my backpack just so I could take better quality photos.2) All the negativity around the EOS M not physically performing on par with DSLRs seemed to really knock down its price to the point where it is now (August 2013) a steal at almost $300 less than the Canon EOS Rebel T3i (with 18-55mm lens) and around $500 less than the 60D.With that said, you now know the perspective from which I am approaching this review, so here are my opinion of its positives and negatives after about 200 test shots in various conditions:POSITIVES +-----------------1) Image quality is far superior to my existing point-and-shoots. That's enough to make me happy.2) The lens and body feel solid and are constructed of mostly metal. The kit lenses with the Rebels feel much more cheaply constructed (plasticy) than the EF-M 18-55mm included with the EOS M.3) The touchscreen is nice. Using the touchscreen seems quicker than navigating the menus using the buttons/dial--probably because you're able to jump to things without having to press directional buttons/dial until you arrive at an item to select.4) EXCELLENT IMAGE QUALITY--it's worth repeating this one because it's all that really matters.==============================================NEGATIVES -------------------1) The battery life is very bad. I couldn't believe how quickly I was able to drain the battery. Of course, the battery drained quicker than usual this time because I have spent so much time navigating through the menus and testing things, but it still was very disappointing despite going into this purchase knowing that short battery life was an issue.2) I feel that the camera is awkward to hold when affixed with the 18-55mm lens. (I have not tried the 22mm lens.) I feel like I could drop it very easily unless I have my left hand underneath the lens to support the weight. It feels a bit front-heavy. And with so much touchscreen interaction necessary, sometimes there's no choice but to use that left hand for some of it.3) The lack of physical buttons is a bit annoying. Things are easy enough to handle through the LCD screen, but I like to be able to change some settings very quickly--sometimes without even having to look back at the LCD screen. Physical buttons are really the only way to be able to accomplish that with an acceptable degree of success. I prefer to have options such as the main shooting modes (P, Tv, Av, etc.) and metering method (spot, center-weighted, evaluative, etc.) accessible by physical buttons/dials.4) The different-style strap connection seems like a good idea, except the tiny piece that locks the strap to the camera is made of plastic! I'm sure it'll work fine, but it does not inspire confidence. I find myself keeping one hand on the camera at all times, just in case.======================================A few other comments...*The autofocus speed and accuracy is fine from my perspective. It's at least as fast as the point-and-shoot cameras I am upgrading from. (My EOS M did come installed with the 2.0.2 firmware.)*I would have loved the experience of using a proper pentaprism optical viewfinder like the one on the Canon EOS 60D, but I've spent the last decade or so using LCD screens exclusively, so I'm not put-off by the lack of a viewfinder.*I love Canon's articulating LCD screens. The fact that this camera did not have one was almost a deal-breaker for me. I like to take a lot of shots from a lower-than-eye-level perspective. I guess I'll have to actually kneel down now. Boo.*It would have been to nice to have even a terrible built-in flash. I don't use a flash often because I normally shoot landscapes, but every now and then I'm photographing a nice sunset with maybe some flowers or other foliage in the foreground that could use a splash of light to make the shot special. Maybe I'll see if I can pick up a used flash to attach someday.*Why doesn't Canon put intervalometer software on their cameras for use in time-lapse photography? It seems like such a simple application to include (and, in fact, can be added to some non-EOS Canons via freely available hack software)In summary, there are certainly some annoying quirks related to the functionality of this camera, but the important things are the lens and the sensor, and, therefore, the image quality. It's a small, lightweight (and, now, relatively inexpensive) way to significantly bump up your image quality without having to lug around a camera that, quite frankly, wouldn't even really fit inside my day-hike backpack. I think the Canon EOS M is a (nearly) perfect option for the enthusiast looking to upgrade from a small sensor point-and-shoot who values compactness over DSLR-level physical performance .", "Date": "August 29, 2013"}, {"Title": "Can't beat this price for Canon users", "Author": "Amy Tsuneishi \"Amy T\"", "ReviewID": "R25FH7F5WORRBE", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "I just got it and my first impressions are quite impressive for the price point and when comparing against cameras in it's price range and against my P&S; Canon S90 (which is what this will ultimately replace). After changing AF settings to ones suggested by other photog gurus and with the 2.0.2 firmware, the camera is relatively good for the AF although not perfect, in some low light and super close macro shots it doesn't always catch on (will try in manual mode at a later time). Very responsive touch screen. It works great in low light as seen by some pictures I shot yesterday and with just a touch to the AF box on the screen it refocuses very easily MOST of the time to the location I want. Video mode is really good and the AF changes are pretty quick when panning and refocusing on a specific object when in video mode. The creative modes that I tried and like are Night with handheld, and HDR which takes a sequence of shots and puts them together for you instead of having to do it in a photo editing program.So far other than the minor AF issues still with 2.0.2 I like it. I know some people have bigger expectations for this little $300 camera with lens, but for me, the biggest thing is that this is a great travel camera. Esp with the 22mm lens.

I have been using the Canon 60D as my main camera and to be honest I really am getting used to the way this bad boy operates.

But I hope nobody was truly expecting that.I wish the front rubber ridge was more pronounced or dramatic so it can feel somewhat like a grip with the right hand. Again minor.Battery life is not the best, I am spoiled by the 60D and it's battery so take that with a grain of salt.Wish it had some sort of built in flash so I could at least use that to trigger my other flashes. For the current puny battery I do understand why it is omitted.Accidental screen touches will happen, which will take shots or adjust settings randomly. Minor annoyance.PROS:Touch to shoot is pretty darn awesome. It's quick, accurate and works the way one imagines it would. Really my favorite feature of this camera.Solid, solid build. Magnesium alloy and feels like a rock. Kudos to Canon on that.Lens (22mm) 35mm equiv is great quality and the perfect companion lens. F/2 yes please. I prefer primes myself.Movie mode with autofocus is fantastic. Although sluggish at times, great nonetheless.Being able to attach all Canon EF EF-S lenses to this is a great boon albeit needing the adapter ring $$$.ENDOverall, I'm really enjoying this camera.

As with photography, this tool will definitely make the shots you want as long as you have the eye for them.", "Date": "July 26, 2013"}, {"Title": "Unexpectedly, very good performance and utility, right out of the box...", "Author": "Hawkeye", "ReviewID": "RDIWPOJN7GY4S", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "Updated: October 2nd, 2013Adventures with the Canon EOS M continued... a field trip and more studio familiarization.The 'bottom line up front': Canon's EOS M is a new SLR form factor camera with excellent value at recent discounts to MSRP.  EOS M provides powerful capabilities (taken from Rebel T4i and 7D product lines) in a small, mirror-less \"SLR\" camera body, one that practically fits into the palm of your hand. It does so with simplicity, price, and performance. If you are an advanced Canon user, EOS M will be familiar. It gives you 18M pixel sensor, a fast on board processor, and a decent-sized, richly detailed rear display. All of this combines to quite a lot to be able to take almost anywhere (especially when it'd be inconvenient to take along anything larger and heavier).What's all the fuss about? Basically, size. This is the smallest SLR I have ever worked with. What is most impressive about it? Size. Once I became accustomed to it's basic differences (viewing \"through\" the rear display instead of a viewfinder, using the rear display as a touch screen to access the familiar Canon menus to control exposure settings and modes) I began to appreciate it much more. What you will have in your hands is a very sophisticated and powerful SLR.What are the drawbacks? A few. Essentially, experienced Canon SLR users will have to adapt themselves to the new form factor. That doesn't take much effort. It does not have the most powerful autofocus system, but it is adequate. Viewing \"through\" the rear display takes some time to get comfortable with.  The 'soft controls' were easy enough to master. Oh, and it does not have a built-in flash. This last was noticed by me, but my XT didn't have one either. And during my field trip, I didn't miss it. I could have used a speed-lite, but chose not to bring one along. EOS M was able to handle most everything I did, indoors and out, without one.On the plus side... EOS is great for video! I did my best in the early SLR video days to avoid it, but EOS is probably going to be the turning point for many on SLR video. It takes great HD video as it does great stills.My latest impressions were gained over the course of several separate studio sessions and a four day field trip for urban hiking and architectural appreciation.  EOS M was great to have handy and was never a burden to carry.So, what's it like? First impressions with EOS M were 'this is different'. I felt some excitement. It is easy to take along. It has great still and video image quality.  The quick videos taken in an urban setting, day and night, indoors and out, were very good. Overall, you have quite a powerful, small camera in your hands.About those complaints...if you are looking for feedback on EOS M, you are going to find it pretty quickly. Lots of reviews out there. Unfortunately, few of those reviews were made with anything more than a cursory look, probably an hour or more, at best. I noted, though, that some real photographers were giving it a thumbs up. I'd read many bad reviews pertaining to autofocus, lack of viewfinder, no controls, or on-board flash. But none of these proved (at least to me) to be real issues. My findings are that most reviewers were probably \"too persnickety\" with this mirror less camera. Their complaints convey to me  a misunderstanding of the EOS M's capabilities and limitations as a system. Perfection usually comes with a price. EOS M is neither pricey nor filled to the brim with perfection.Back in the studio... many wonderful photographs are made with natural and abundant ambient window light. If you can find it, and know how to use it, your photos will be standouts. Sometimes, though, you need to manufacture wonderful light. And for many photographers that means using studio lighting. I wondered if I could use EOS M with my studio strobes and almost immediately discovered that EOS M had the same manual exposure mode as my larger Canons and with the hot shoe, I could mount and use my Pocket Wizards. And in a moment, I was in business! Whether shooting a miniature doll or photographing a flat highly detailed document, the strobes give you the wonderful light needed to make great photographs. And EOS M (with Canon's EF/EF-S lens adapter) let me use any Canon lens I needed. On a tripod, I got \"peer quality results\" (meaning almost the same as my larger, APS-H and full frame Canons). Being able to use any EF/EF-S lens gave me room to explore using macro lenses, wide open glass (F1.4) and more.  Better glass meant larger and heavier, but also improved results. I wouldn't say it would replace my other SLRs, but I could use it in the studio if and when I wanted to. I think it offers great flexibility and opportunity.In sum, give the EOS M it's due. I was well satisfied with my experience. Take a look. If you're new to Canon, take a look, too. This is all about opportunity to explore!Uodated 8-13-2013. I purchased this EOS M camera mostly out of curiosity and the recent price roll back created a window of opportunity. In spite of very mixed reviews, I still felt that there was a pony to be had in this new form factor from Canon given its heritage and use of existing technology from the latest Rebel.* Right out of the box: Simplicity. After some quick try outs, I was warmed over.  The familiar control of functions are there, under 'the skin' just waiting to be used. No worries.* I was very interested to see results with EF and EF-S lenses. I mated the lens adapter, purchased separately, to the Canon 70-300mm L. The combination is a 'monster' and you feel like you are using a lens to photograph with.  The EOS M is that tiny. I experienced only some sluggishness with focusing, but nothing out of the ordinary. My quick test was simply shooting through the window, screen and two panes of glass. The results at 100 to 300 mm were as expected, lens IS covered some of the shake at 300mm (without tripod). A photo at 300mm produced a fair quality scene.* Turning back indoors, it was time for some testing with both a paper document to sim the 'lab test' and some small figures to check depth of field and background blur. I used a 600ws studio strobe (at about 1/8 power) and a 48 inch deep octabox soft box for some fill light. The EOS M manual mode was easy enough to find with the instruction booklet within a minute. At F11 and 1/125th second, a Pocket Wizard handling the relay duties, and a tripod, the scene was ready to shoot. Setup no harder than for any other camera/lens combination. I mated the EOS M, Canon M to EF/EF-S adapter, and EF-S 60mm macro. A nice combination. Very small. The results were stunning. Framing and focusing were much different without a viewfinder, but not too bad to adapt to.  At F11, there was no visual image in live view until the shutter button was depressed halfway. A brief frame was visible for a couple of seconds, enough to ensure focus and frame.  A few quick shots let me fine tune the composition.  The out of camera jpeg results were very good to great. The absolute range of detail using a multicolored, fine lined document for the test was unexpectedly superb; great color and image quality. I have no scale for these results, but if I'm smiling at the results on screen, I usually consider it a winner. The results with the EF 50mm F1.4 were also stunning at F1.4.  looking down at a candle in glass holder, about two inches tall, on a mat, the upper most lip of the glass holder is in sharp focus while the remainder and the mat underneath dissolve into a very smooth out of focus background. These were very quick tests and the results were terrific. The use of EF lens and adapter seems to be a good combination although there was some 'hunting' going on. Using the Sigma 28-300mm DG F3.5-6.3 macro (EF mount) caused lots of hunting in continuos autofocus (the default mode for EOS-M). This was to cause very excessive battery drain over the two day trials. It sounded a lot like C3PO in the movie Star Wars! The solution was to disable continuous autofocus. Results were much longer battery life. Cautionary tale here is to use better glass if you are going to adapt EF lenses and the faster the better. I achieved much better results with the Canon EF-S 17-85mm F4-5.6 lens, especially with video.* The BIG PICTURE: As for now, the basis for great imaging are there. As a photographer, my main job is to unleash them. This camera will aid the inexperienced in making very good photographs and excellent video. And if you want to learn, this could be an excellent tool in learning the advanced program and manual modes. The market seems to swamped with camera gadgets. But Nothing is going to create great photographs at every turn without some effort from the photographer. Photography is still about capturing light! And you still have to be in the 'light place at the light time'. That said, I notice some extraordinary capabilities in this tiny package, something I am willing to work at in order to improve myself and to learn how unlock 'stunning results.' I was quite satisfied with this purchase. My last Rebel was an XT, a few years back which, while not great, enabled me to learn quite a bit about digital photography. The EOS M has ten more megapixels and a greatly improved imaging processor to work with. It has scads more low light sensitivity. Overall, it has about 25 percent more resolution, giving it significantly higher image quality. It is fast, lightweight, handy and has a superb back screen for viewing. Colors and image quality are immediately confirmed. Video has been terrific. Nice HD quality. Whether using the 18-55mm kit lens or the EF-S 17-85mm with adapter, the focusing and zoom were totally silent. Low light performance was very good. Using the EF-135mm F2 L and adapter, I grabbed some very dreamy natural light images indoors at evening with direct sunlight coming through some of the windows. The low lit walls and shadows were well captured. At F2, lots of nice out of focus backgrounds.* PERFORMANCE: The familiar \"green box\" mode automation is extensive. It is basically a one button operation. All or most decisions made by the camera. Video with kit lens was excellent; autofocus using stepping motor with the kit lens and the EF-S 17-85mm USM silent. Great sound capture. I will be upgrading the focus firmware next. If that improves auto focus, then this camera will evolve dramatically. Right now, I am still aquatinting myself with new 'live view' style shooting method using the back screen rather than a view finder. Focus hunting is something I am more curious about than frustrated with, as I have observed this all before many times with other camera and lens combinations. Auto focus is usually a given, but does fail under some conditions and settings. Again, use best quality lenses to minimize problems.  If using other lenses like the older Sigma 28-300mm DG (without IS) expect to invest time and effort.* FORM FACTOR:  This is an exceptionally small and easy to carry package. It was easy to use and carry at the zoo during a two hour visit.  Video was superb. It easily captured the excitement of our train ride, complete with all of the steam action and whistle sounds. External controls are primarily 'one button.' If you need more control, the ability to learn the functions of this camera is enhanced if you have been a Canon user already. The touch screen lets you access them more easily than expected. You are able to see and set controls with a software enabled slide. Control conventions are common across Canon product lines. There is an inherent advantage in using small, compact equipment.* CONCLUSION: Small, simple to use camera for travel or everyday use. EOS M will not replace the big camera bodies, but may be a terrific proxy for them when it is impracticable to carry them about. Landscape and dramatic scene photography should be achievable. Action subjects may pose some steep challenges. An all around snapshot camera, with the 18-55mm kit lens. The Video performance was very good. If you are an advanced photographer, with a full kit of EF and EF-S lenses, than this camera is like a miniature, late model Rebel. It has very good still and video capabilities and is ready to travel or assist in the studio. This product deserves more attention.", "Date": "August 11, 2013"}, {"Title": "Much better than some reviews would have you believe...", "Author": "Shawade", "ReviewID": "R24TDDI5FWFKBN", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I will try and avoid some of the comments already made. I love this camera completely and bought it to use as a small/lightweight travel option instead of my SLR. I am used to Canon cameras and so through brand loyalty and a desire to stick with what I know works, I went for this.Canon do not typically comment on reviews of their products but they could have marketed this better. Many people seem to have the view that it is compromised compared to what they were expecting. It is a small, stripped down camera that basically puts a much higher quality sensor and processor combo on the end of a great lens in your hands that produces better images than other compact options.If Canon had added a flash, a built in viewfinder or even a larger grip, it would have become less of a minimalist option and more of a, well, a small SLR. And if you want a viewfinder, flash, grip etc then... go buy the SLR...The positives:- Takes excellent sharp images- Very small body and, with the 22mm lens, looks pretty much like a large Ixus compact- Touch screen is significantly better than any previous Canon touch screen I have owned. Not far off a iPhone in terms of accuracy- Easy to select key functions with the touch screen, and to identify the focus point you want to lock on toI would like to address some of the comments I read before purchasing:\"it is slow to focus\" - this is true. If you want to capture action shots then use your SLR. It does focus fast enough for kids, family scenes etc. With the touch screen the process of identifying the focus point and locking on is quick enough.\"it doesn't have a flash or viewfinder\" - correct on both counts. Both would add weight and bulk, so if you want those, get an SLR or G16 (or G1X)\"its hard to hold with no grip\" - I am 6'2\" and have hands in proportion to my height... I have no trouble holding itI have booth lenses with it (zoom and 22mm) - both are producing very clear and sharp images compared to compact cameras. It does not compare with my EOS 5D MkIII with L lenses but then, i wasn't expecting it to. But compared to compact cameras it is a very good alternative.Overall, this is a terrific camera that allows me to take (and enjoy taking) very good images in a small and discrete package that is ideal for travel....and at the current prices on Amazon frankly its a steal.", "Date": "December 3, 2013"}, {"Title": "Great for photos, one of the best for video", "Author": "josh \"jtd\"", "ReviewID": "R18C6ZD3OZ56DA", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "EDIT: An announcement was made that firmware will be released at the end of june that will greatly speed up the AF performance. so... END EDITThis camera is fantastic, I have had it for awhile now and it pleases me more every time I use it.First, build quality: the build on this camera is easily up to the par of the xxD line of prosumer cameras.. well at least from the 50D back, as the camera is built with magnesium alloy on the whole body and an aluminum cased lens. Short of the weather sealing it is built like the tanks of the eos line.Ergonomics: Now, I'm not a clumsy person, I don't go around throwing my cameras all over. even so the M (black version) is really a pleasure to hold and I don't find myself fighting for grip with it. I can't use the rebel line of cameras, they just don't fit me, in fact I am not partial to using the smaller of the xxD line (20,30,40,60D) without a vertical grip. The eos M is a great fit, perhaps it's the size to weight ratio, but it just feels right in my hands. Just in case I do use a wrist strap, I made one by taking one of the neck strap quick connects off and attaching a regular wrist strap (for a nikon 1) through it just as if it were a normal eyelet.Menus: I didn't think i would like the lack of buttons and touchscreen, however I now find them extremely intuitive, one handed operation on the rear is extremely easy. the jog wheel on the rear can control almost all the functions i would need (shutter speed, aperture, exposure comp, etc) one of my favorite things is that the settings stay with the mode I am in, for instance if I have the mode set for A and have it set for multi shot and the focus set to flexizone multi and autofocus, I can switch quickly (using the top dial) to manual and have it set for single point and AF+MF. Most of the parameters and menu features stay with the modes as well, great for switching quickly between two completely different shooting styles.  the touch screen is great as well, i can scroll through things with the right dial and then immediately select something to change or a menu by touching, the touch to focus and shoot has been fantastic for tripod shots.Focus: yes, this has been a very outspoken item whenever the M is even mentioned, so much so that the rest of the camera is ignored. is it slow at times, yes, would I pan with a subject and shoot frame after frame all the way down the pitch at a soccer match, probably not. it also isn't great for just run and gun style photography. but most would have a higher end SLR if they really plan on this style of photography. honestly, whenever I think it might be too slow, I prefocus or simply use manual focus. I know this might sound like a pain, but a good photographer will get very good at this. I do this even with my SLR, why? well.. as smart as the AF systems are, they don't always put just what I want in focus, so by the time I pressed to select the focus point and framed, then focused, I usually could have done it faster on the M's fantastically clear screen. don't want the \"hassel\"? don't even think about buying a leica..... I shot a street festival recently and used manual focus for quite a bit of the action, maybe one out of 50 or so shots wasn't quite the right focus, and that was at f4 at 200mm. that said I love using the AF+MF mode, I can quickly let the camera get close and then narrow right in without any hunt. Low light with no AF assist? you shouldn't be using auto... that's all I'm really going to say about it, it works fine for my style.EDIT: forgot to say how to increase the AF speed for those that aren't too familiar with AF systems, on the M change the AF type to flexizone- single and under the second menu, disable continuous AF.  The single point AF is much faster and more accurate because it is more direct, no multi-step, complex algorithm, face detection etc.  turning off the continuous AF keeps the camera from hunting and also saves battery life as the camera isn't constantly trying to adjust focus when you are just holding the camera. with these settings the AF is great for this type of camera and should be fantastic once the faster firmware is released.  :END EDITImage quality: this is one of the places this camera really starts to shine, with the digic 5 processor and aps-c sensor this camera is up there with the best prosumer cameras outside of full frame. the low light quality is fantastic and even large prints are just wonderful to see. right out of the box with the 22mm the image quality is better than any fixed lens camera i have ever seen, and yet I can take it everywhere with me just like a point and shoot. I use the lowepro dashpoint 20 case and it fits the camera with 22mm lens and wrist strap into something i can even run with, its great wearing everyday on a belt or slipping into a bag, try that with any size SLR ;)now the real treat comes when using the adapter and L lenses. the picture quality is outstanding, and it recognizes the lens I am using and can automatically ( and quite nicely ) correct the known distortions and vignetting for that lens at the given aperture and focal length.Big lens ergonomics: on my SLRs I have to have a vertical grip, especially when shooting with a 70-200Lnow with this camera and that lens, its more like the camera is attached to the back of the lens and not the other way around. given this, you are really holding the lens and not the camera, as such its actually more comfortable for me than with the tiny lens, I can hold with my left hand and adjust things by touching the screen or using the dial with my right.did I mention the image quality? yea, well its that good. I actually prefer it to the 60D, the build quality is better, the functions are easier to use, and the processor is better, what does that mean? it introduces us to the next point.Video: where have you been all my life? The M is not actually that much bigger than a gopro and yet the video is up there with the best DSLRs, the brilliant thing is that I can shoot full manual and have the pro quality look of low shutter speed (no rolling shutter) and variable DOF.. the fantastic thing is that with just a small RAM mount I can produce in-car and on-car footage that is above and beyond an action cam and rock solid, this camera is even unobtrusive suction cupped to my windshield. The digic 5 processor works wonders in this cam and the screen is a joy to film with. the M has a stereo 3.5mm mic input and manual volume adjustment. whats more, it doesn't overheat like some of the even more expensive cams like some of the 7Ds, it shoots continually for 29min 59sec though the file is broken apart into 12min segments on the card. I use 16 and 32gig sandisk extreme SDHC cards and at full resolution I got the full length of video 100% error free..using this camera to shoot video with L lenses is a joy, the video is pristine and as you use manual focus in video anyway, the big slr is actually at a disadvantage here, I can fly this camera, steady cam it, suction cup it, etc. far easier than many of the larger SLRs and yet the video outshines more than its fair share, with audio features not even found on some of the go-to cameras in the market.What can I say, I'm thoroughly impressed.. and it more than easily fits in my carry on.......", "Date": "June 5, 2013"}, {"Title": "Hands down, best camera for the money right now", "Author": "Patrick D.

The thing has slow focus, even with most recent firmware (version whatever, it's October 2013 so it isn't the first run which apparently was quite bad). In low light sometimes it fails to autofocus entirely.HOWEVER...Right now, the current selling price of the $350-$400 range, you can't get a better camera. I bought a kit (not from Amazon this time) with the body, the 22mm prime, and the 90EX flash unit for $400. All of it. Remember people, this is a 650D sensor, essentially an identical camera in a smaller form factor, and you can get the body, an excellent flash, and an awesome lens especially for video (22mm in APS-C is 35mm equivalent). If you are a pro- or even amateur photographer or someone who likes to use full-size DSLRs, I can understand being underwhelmed by some of the shortcomings of the camera. But for the everyman, this camera is rugged, far more portable than a DSLR, and takes gorgeous photographs and stunning video under non-demanding (i.e. not pitch black) conditions. I feel like I got a great deal; for $400 I really don't think you can touch this without giving up some of the perks of the platform.One thing I like a lot is the touchscreen; I didn't think I would, but the touch-to-focus feature is in my mind a killer app for people that want to take great-looking pics without knowing a thing about photography. It's basically an automated manual focus; a finger tap to the screen where you want to focus, it focuses on that zone, and snaps a pic. Super handy and not slow as long as the lighting situation isn't awful. I was also impressed with the HDR quality I got without using a tripod or any stabilization aid. Cool stuff.

If you're moving up from a Powershot, Coolpix or whatever, welcome to the big time.  If you're looking for a second SLR, only smaller, I suppose it fits that description but not really.The good:  Very small  & solid, good 22mm lens, 18 megapixels, can use all Canon SLR lenses with adapter, touch screen works well if you give it a chance, made in Japan, stereo mics for movies.The bad:  No viewfinder option, no flash (the mark of a Canon \"pro\" camera), strap \"buttons\" look like they came off the case of an old Rolleiflex.Neither great nor terrible:  Focus w/22mm is pretty quick but not spectacular with new firmware, lens lacks stabilization, battery ok but ridiculously expensive, it's small but not that light, 18 megapixels just makes large files, use of EF lenses via adapter is possible, but why?If size is your main concern and you stick to the 22mm lens & don't mind carrying a separate flash, this makes a very high quality package.  On the other hand, if you want the M so you can use different lenses, all of them except perhaps the 40mm will make the camera close to the size of a small SLR.  I don't have the lens adapter yet (genuine Canon is reasonable if you order from Hong Kong) so I can't say how well this works but seeing guys online put a 70-200mm f/2.8 lens on the M and then complain about the focus speed just baffles me.  It's a miracle this combination works at all but if you're carrying a lens that size who needs a pocket camera for it?In summary, an excellent buy, and next time around, with a viewfinder and normal strap lugs, they'll have it right, but it'll go back up to $700.Update - Just received the (genuine Canon) adapter.  It works, but something I hadn't noticed before; when using manual focus, the M does not give any indication when you're in focus, not even a sound.  Autofocus with the adapter works, but is somewhat slower even with the 40mm lens.  On the other hand, if you own some smaller old lenses like Olympus OM or some Nikon/Pentax/Minolta wide angles, and you have an EOS mount adapter for them, you can put them on the EOS lens-to-M mount adapter and they work beautifully on the M.

I bought the $70 adapter on ebay to attach my other Canon lenses, and that was fun to play with.Pros: low light movies...really good!

After I made the switch, I never thought about a DC again as I prefer the picture quality and operation speed of a DSLR. However, I always dream of a DC type of camera, with DSLR quality. I tried the mirror-less in the market, they are OK, but not as good as I expected. The size is still not small enough. RX100 is an interesting camera but relatively small sensor and higher price stopped me. G1X is not small but spec is good enough. However, sluggish AF makes me to think about it again.Recently I find more use of a phone as a camera. This makes me to think about a DC substitute again. I would like to get a RX1 but price is way too high. Well, at the right time, Canon released a new firmware to improve the AF and priced down the EOS-M. For just 299 bucks, I did not hesitate to get a 22mm kit.After one week use, I think I can make some comment.Firstly, who should buy this camera: Those moved from DC and would like to get better picture quality. They don't want to sacrifice the portability, and don't mind a prime lens (35/2 effectively). Or DSLR users who want a small DC with DSLR quality and don't mind sluggish performance.What you get: a tiny (compare to DSLR) metal body with a APS-C sensor (very large, compare to DC), very good touch screen, camera, and a fast and surprisingly good 35/2 lens.What you can expect: easy to use interface with touch screen DSLR level picture quality, better bokeh with f2 prime lens (compare to DC).What are missing: view finder (some people might care, but I DON'T), no internal flash (should not be a deal breaker for 22mm f2 lens, but sometimes it could be annoying).Now it is the deal breaker, for many people, including myself. If you are a DSLR user and looking for a DSLR substitute, don't expect too much. The performance is kind of between a 5D2 and old school 990. It takes more than a seconds to start, it takes 0.5 second to focus (it should be faster with 18-55 though). And shoot to shoot time is close to 2 seconds. So this is not a camera for sports. And it is not a camera for faster moving objects.Video is on par with other DSLR's, easy to use, but AF sometimes hunts even with face lock (I really miss manual focus). I am still trying to find out how to control focus and I don't know how to use manual AF yet (I will update this review once I find out).Touch screen is superb. I used Panasonic GF2 and the touch screen made me don't want to use it. But the touch screen on EOS-M is much like a 2 years old Android smart phone (not as responsive as a HTC One) but still very responsive. It is easy to use, you can control everything (Aperture, shutter speed, ISO, AF, picture quailty, P/A/T/M mode etc.). You can easily zoom in/out a picture with 2 fingers just like a smart phone. Kudos Canon.The 22mm lens is also good. I have quite a few Canon primes including the 50L. the 22mm one has better build quality than 50/1.8. The center is really sharp at f2. Corner softness and purple fringe is not bad. F2 is very usable. The aperture has 7 blades, compare to the 5 blade 50/1.8, it has better bokeh, no annoying pentagon shaped dots anymore. The color is OK, typical prime lens, of course. IMO this lens worth at least $150.My wish list: Please make AF as fast as a Nikon 1 or Sony NEX. Make manual AF easier and enable complete AF for video shooting. Reduce the start up time and shoot to shoot time. Add an internal flash. This would be a killer DC.Bottom line: The camera is as good as I expected. I just wish it would be better. But, it is very capable as a back up camera for DSLR user. I can bring it with me when I hike with kids, go to parks with kids. I don't need to bring a large camera bag (5D2 with 35L is not small). It meets my expectation and price is superb. i cannot complain anything with it. So I give it 5 start. I only hope Canon can make EOS-M Mark II a killer mirror-less, but I guess you would have to pay 3x the price I paid.", "Date": "July 21, 2013"}, {"Title": "It doesn't seem to make sense, until you use it..", "Author": "Jetro", "ReviewID": "R1E38GW9RS89XY", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "First, let me just get the focus issues out of the way... it's not as good as DSLRs but it is not as bad as what the reviews say it is.

Compared to my trusty old xsi, as I said, focusing is not as fast but definitely not as bad as others describe it. Maybe the new firmware fixed it.  I mostly shoot landscapes so I can imagine myself using this without any problem.For canon DSLR user, like myself, I consider this a good backup.

I'm glad I made the purchase.--- UPDATE 7/11/2013 ----If I could I would rate this camera a 4.5, I can't give it a 5 because of 1 (I consider major) flaw.. the shot to shot interval is just not good enough for a modern camera.  I can imagine loosing a moment as it takes some time for the camera to be ready right after the last one. It's not terrible just by today standards (sony nex, olympus, panasonic ILCs) it's slow.But I am raising my rating by half a star as the image quality being produced is really good.  Also, I am liking the touch interface combined with the dial button the more I use it.  I am very happy I purchased this camera.  It's not perfect but I can see that this is the start of a (new) good thing, I am looking forwared to EOS M2.  For now, I think about it this way.. even if the camera is (just a bit of) a letdown, the 22mm lens more than makes up for it and is more than worth the money for $249.. so the eos m body is just $50 if you think about it.. not bad eh?

I think a dslr would be far easier to use in that case due to the way the camera is held and the use of the view finder for focusing.  My camera has the upgraded firmware and focuses plenty fast for most of my uses.  I have arthritis in my hands and using this camera is a pleasure after using the Canon 7D.  Don't get me wrong.  I love my 7D but it is a heavy camera particularly with a L lens attached.  I will continue to use the 7D for many purposes I am sure.

Considering that the \"kit\" lens that the EOS M comes with (I got the 22mm) is similar in perspective and performance to the Panasonic 20mm 1.7 that I'd be adding to the Olympus, my overall initial investment is about half with the Canon of what it would be with the Olympus.I had a chance to compare the focus speed before and after the 2.0.2 firmware update and the improvement is incredible.

It's not a DSLR, and I don't believe it's trying to pretend to be one.BUT...after the firmware update, Canon really fixed the AF issue.  Like, completely.  It zips around just as quick as any other mirrorless camera that I've used or am still using (Panny GX1, NEX-5n).  Post-shot blackout time is perhaps a bit more perceptible than others, but it's not debilitating by any means.  You can learn to work around it.Image quality is fantastic -- same sensor as recent Rebels and the 7D.  Touchscreen interface (if you're into that.  Again, this is entirely subjective.) is fun, intuitive, and lightning-quick.  Build quality is best in class.  I'd take this into a potentially dangerous environment (subway, children's playroom, etc.) much more readily than I would a GX1 or NEX.Haven't used an OM-D or PL5 or any of those guys, so I can't compare.  The OM-D is a different class and is a different beast altogether anyway, so comparing oranges to apples won't help anyone.The 22mm lens is worth this price all by itself.  Seriously, I'd pay 300 for this lens alone; it's incredibly sharp, light, fast, has negligible distortion, and renders images really beautifully.  I love the 35mm-equivalent field-of-view (but this is also subjective).  It's a nice story-telling focal length.  Haven't used the 18-55 zoom, so I can't comment on that.The EOS-M is what it is: a small, reliable, fun-to-use, take-anywhere camera that gives you the same image quality as any of Canon's top-flight crop-sensor DSLRs (save for the newest, and yet-to-be-released-and-seen, 70D) in a tiny little powerhouse of a package.  And now with the newest firmware update, one really can't complain about the AF anymore.  Don't try to track birds in flight with this thing.  But, if you're like me, and have kiddos and diaper bags and groceries to carry around town but don't want to add a brick of a DSLR to your load, the EOS-M is a very, very reasonable compromise.

As I see it, its a travel companion camera for the photography enthusiast who wants a compact mirrorless system to use with point and shoot sensibilities without giving up the abilities of a DSLR. This means, if you are going to get an EOS M, you got at least a DSLR, and most likely the Canon system.  This camera complements a DSLR user. This camera is not meant to get G15 or Powershot user to move up the product line. The EOS Rebel SL1 is. So niche crowd. Plenty of people complain about the 22mm lens, not for its IQ, but for its lack of zoom. Seriously, non camera enthusiasts will not likely care for the merits of a well made prime lens.  Lack of flash is a concern for others. Canon historically do not include popup flashes for their more \"serious\" cameras. Again, another sign Canon is not positioning this camera towards the point and shoot crowd.That said, i think this kit is awesome for the camera guy who loves adventure like me. When traveling, I still want a decent lens and dslr quality in a compact form. I need something light and compact so I can carry it around or be stealthy. This camera fits the bill. I get a lightweight, high IQ camera that i can just take shots.  Then when i see an awesome creative shot, still have the abilty to create something amazing.  This is not a sports camera. It's a camera for the patient.  If youre moving up from a point and shoot, the learning curve is high. There are very few scene modes.  With the new FW, the AF just snaps and locks in. its not fast as a phase detect dslr focus, but its still pretty quick.  There is no more hesitation. The AF is usuable for most situations now except maybe sports. But I do not believe this camera was designed for that. Its for the slow and methodical tog.The next lens for the M system is an ultra wide angle 10-20mm.  Again, UWA lens cater to an enthusiasts. If Canon wanted to cater to the main stream, the lens wouldve been a 18-200. cuz zoom sells. UWA lens are also popular with landscape, cityscape and architecture shots.

I find that I use the Canon EOS M with 22mm lens more and more and that I use my Canon 7D and 1D less and less.Pros:- Very easy to use as a high-quality point-and-shoot (just use the automatic A+ mode)- Very easy to use as a mini-DSLR with the usual modes (P, Tv, Av, M) and controls (shutter speed, aperture, ISO, Exposure evaluation (evaluative, center-weighted, ...), Exposure Value, White balance, ...)- Very portable  (I take more pictures because, like a point-and-shoot, it's easy to take the camera with me.)- Excellent touch-screen interface- Excellent image quality due to a modern, large 18MP sensor of the type used in crop-sensor DSLRs  (physically larger than the point and shoot sensors, same physical size as the DSLR APS-C crop-sensors used in cameras like the Canon T5i, 70D, 7D.)- Excellent lenses:  The 18-55mm with image stabilization is versatile and much better than typical kit lenses (grade A-);  The 22mm f/2 is very fast and very sharp (grade A+; similar in quality to the well-regarded Canon 50mm f/1.4).  (The 22mm is so sharp that I can use it as a pseudo-400mm because cropping to 5% of the original leaves a worthwhile, reasonably sharp picture)- EF-S lens adapter:  Existing Canon EF and EF-S lenses can be used on this camera.

With the way you have your camera set-up and how, and what you intend to shoot, really determines if this camera will work for you. In my case, it has complemented my full size, full-frame DSLR in a positive way.I shoot in manual with my 5D MK II, viewfinder exclusively, center single point AF, and I program the back button to focus. My EOS M is similarly set-up like this, albeit using the lcd screen (which isn't as hard of a transition as I thought), adjusting the focus point via touch screen (instead of recomposing), and a few other settings I'm unable to do with my MK II. The AF speed is good, but still not quick enough to acquire focus on a fast moving subject, typically ones moving closer to, or away from you. If you're struggling with focusing, here's a hint...to acquire faster, more precise focus, focus on an edge with varying contrast in the subject you're trying to capture. Low light, bright light, your success rate will increase if you know how to acquire focus properly with the sensors in your camera. And to add to my settings...for the record, the focus assist beam is set to off (nobody likes getting blinded by it), and it works fine in most scenarios without it on...you just have to know how to focus.Handling the EOS M may be tough for larger than average hands, I could image. For me, I find it's comfortable to hold (I'm of average height and build), buttons are layed out perfectly without getting in the way. It's a pocketable camera (jacket pocket that is), especially with the 22mm attached. It's not a camera you'll forget is in your pocket. Its body is mostly magnesium, built better than any other camera this size...even better than most entry level DSLR's.Unfortunately there are only 3 native lenses for the M, with one not being sold in the US (c'mon Canon, show some love). Both the 22mm f/2 and 18-55mm f/3.5-5.6 IS are really great glass. The optics are sharp and provide nice contrast. I'll eventually buy the EF adapter when I want to extend the range of my EF glass.Buy/bring a couple spare batteries if you plan to go out on shoots. With the LCD as your only way of seeing your frame, and the small capacity battery, it's possible you'll run them down faster than you'd like. But again, it's all how you set-up and use your camera.

I find that I have to keep turning the camera off to prevent unanticipated settings changes as I walk. I have a Panasonic GX1 that has a similar touchscreen shutter, but have not experienced this problem on walkabouts.On the subject of focus, the smallest focus zone on the EOS M is far too large. The focus point on the GX1 can be set much smaller. The focus point on my Olympus E-P1 is about the same size as the EOS M, but appears to focus more accurately. A plus on the EP-1 is that when the camera is set to Autofocus+Manual Focus, just moving the manual focus ring on the lens automatically zooms to 10x which then reverts back to full screen a second or so after you've stopped adjusting focus. This is much quicker than the EOS M method of constantly tapping the touchscreen magnifying glass.Image quality (with sharpness set to maximum) is about on par with the GX1, which I would describe as somewhat \"creamy\". I prefer the \"out of camera\" sharpness of the Olympus E-P1. However, in both the EOS M and GX1 sharpness is easily adjusted post production. This criticism may not be fair, as I have only the 18-55mm and 11-22mm Canon lenses.

In conjunction with the 22mm STM lens, indoor photography is a cinch. In relatively low light, I'm able to shoot at 1/40 f/2.0 ISO1600 and not have to do much in terms of image correction. To not hesitate shooting in ISO1600 is a blessing as the noise produced doesn't become discernible except at full resolution. While the 18-55MM may provide more versatility, you lose a lot of your indoor shooting capabilities not being able to open the aperture more. I also want to commend the screen included with the camera. On my old Pentax K-x, the 320k screen made it hard to make out fine details unless you transferred the photo files to a computer to preview. With the EOS M, it is quite easy to see how well a photo came out just looking on the screen.The only area I have an issue with is the AF. Even with the firmware update, its somewhat sluggish, though it doesn't roam the entire focusing gamut. Unless continuous AF is shut off and Single-Point Flex is selected, expect lengthy focusing times. The absence of a built in flash is noticeable, but it doesn't bother me much since they generally wash out all the details. It is compatible with external flashes (such as the EX90) so if you feel the need to add one you can.That all being said, the image quality is REALLY impressive. The JPEG processing is solid, the RAW photos surpass my K-x easily, and every f-stop seems to be extremely sharp (i.e. there's no specific 'sweet spot', it looks good no matter how open or closed the aperture is).At the original price, I'd be hesitant to purchase this. But at $300 w/ a lens that is great for indoors and produces crisp images, it's an easy recommendation.", "Date": "July 14, 2013"}, {"Title": "EOS M - Review Based on Video Usage", "Author": "seabass57", "ReviewID": "R2VAFGOYFOAOVF", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "I am a professional videographer and purchased this camera to complement my other pro level EOS cameras. The idea was to have this camera as a separate angle that I can easily hide at live events, etc due to its small size and ability to at least semi auto-focus if left unattended. There are plenty of other still use reviews out there so I will add specifically regarding video use:- Control - Manual control is great. Full control of ISO, shutter, aperture, etc. However ISO is stuck to the main options (100, 200, 400) instead of allowing the more ideal 160, 640, etc ISO settings for lowest noise with video. I thought I'd hate the touch screen. While I miss having more buttons, for the size it works just fine. Again, I am using primarily as a static angle. I couldn't imagine trying to shoot manual run and gun with the touch screen. That needs to be left to the proper larger DSLRs.- Focus - yeah, its slow but its AF on video. Fine for an alternate wide-angle where the subjects may move around some, but don't expect this to perform like a video camera. You still need to know how to operate it manually.- Battery - this was a big concern, as most reviews say battery is awful. Its decent in my test. It ran for 1 hr 40 min in full auto pointing at a static scene. I am sure battery will go faster with a moving scene where the servo AF has to keep adjusting, but I wanted to test best case scenario and 1.40 is not bad. It does of course stop recording at 30 min so until (hopefully) magic lantern comes out for this cam you are stuck at 30 min like with the MKIII and other Canons.- Lens - the 22mm is not bad. I have not tested the zoom. The entire ring is used to MF which is nice and it performs well at 2.0 providing some nice bokeh.- Playback - this is pretty cool. You swipe like a smart phone between shots and pinch to zoom, etc. The screen is not bad for fingerprints, though it will require frequent cleaning. The manual recommends against protective screens, but I may still try this to keep the screen safe.- Audio - manual control like the other new DSLRs. I have not tested much audio yet, but it does provide for an external mic with the 3.5 jack. You will want to use an external, bc the servo noise from AF is loud enough to be heard from the internal mics.- Price - it is not an inexpensive camera, but performs much better than then G1X or G15 series if you are looking for EOS functionality (1.6 crop sensor look and feel) so in that regard you pay for the features you are looking for.Overall, a great addition for video use. I have a GH2 which is of course known for video performance as a mirror-less but the color is less pleasing than the Canons. Everyone has an opinion, this is just mine when I try to mix cameras in post. With the EOS M I will be able to better match color between cameras. I have a 60D and MKIII as well and it seems to perform close to the same as far as image quality to the 60D, obviously no where near the MKIII. Recommended as long as your expectations are not over the top for the use-case for this camera. If you are a casual video shooter and hoping this will provide full auto focus/exposure with that coveted DSLR look, you may be frustrated with the result. No camera (yet at least) that is not $10k plus can do this currently. But this encourages learning manual use which can actually be fun. Hope this helps if you are considering this camera.", "Date": "November 15, 2012"}, {"Title": "Replace your T3i??

I know my way around a DSLR.-Focus is undecided. I mean a 5D is slow, but the M just wonders around and 70% of the time gets it in an ok lit room.-No view finder sucks for stills cause it makes focus harder.-Touch screen is great.-Photo quality is pretty good. Between a t2i and 7d.-HD video is fantastic, though getting focus and keeeping it there is tough. Manual focus for video is a must but there is no focus peak to tell you if you are in focus or not in manual. Do not get this if you are a video blogger holding the camera in your hand and talking on your adventures. The focus is loud and distracting and it will never be pleased with the focus and adjust.-22mm if fantastic!-EF L lenses on ok, but the AF makes the L glass sound like a mild Semi automatic rifle.This camera does not replace a T3i. It has some cool features and is not a horrible camera. Since the price dropped, this could be a good entry or transition to DSLR, but to get this for its compactness just isnt worth it if you already know the glory of a canon DSLR.I am uploading a short video to show you how distracting the the auto focus can be in a FULL AUTO movie mode. Its not terribly horrible, but its the obvious desired feature that leaves you wanting. Its the continuous back and forth movement that makes it so bad. There is rarely a smooth transition into focus.

I originally bought the kit with the 22mm f/2 STM. After using the camera to grab a few family snap shots, I decided to add the 18-55mm lens to my kit as well. If you've used any of Canon's 18-megapixel DSLRs produced in the last few years, you can expect image quality to be nearly identical, which is to say very, very good. I also decided to pick up the EF-EOS M adaptor so I could toss the EOS M in my bag as an emergency backup body for trips.I recommend getting the 22mm f/2 even if you buy the kit with the 18-55mm zoom lens. While I like the flexibility of the zoom lens, the image quality of the 22mm f/2 is surprisingly good, is excellent even wide open. The 22mm provides a field-of-view equivalent to a 35mm, which is an excellent focal-length for environmental portraits and a general purpose walk around lens. The 22mm also makes the whole camera a lot more compact, which is sort of the point of having a small camera in the first place. It's great having the zoom for times when focal-length flexibility is more important that aperture, but I use the 22mm whenever I can.My biggest complaint with the camera (now that the focus speed has been dramatically improved) is the lack of a physical dial for adjusting aperture/shutter speed. I wish Canon would have included at least one near the shutter button - it is sorely missed, especially after years of using a DSLR. I'm sure those upgrading from a point-and-shoot won't miss it, but I think there's a huge market for those using it as a second camera to a DSLR, and better controls would be a vast improvement. Luckily the touch screen is easy to use, and the thumb dial can be used to adjust settings, but it just isn't as easy to use or as responsive as the dials on Canon's DSLRs.The EOS M is a fantastic camera, especially at the prices currently being offered. There's little reason to not buy this camera at the current price. I just hope Canon releases an improved EOS M in the near future, presumably using the new dual-pixel AF shown on the 70D. Don't be afraid to pick up this model right now, you'll always be able to use the lenses (and probably the battery) with a newer model.", "Date": "August 20, 2013"}, {"Title": "NO BRAINER FOR $299", "Author": "Rabbi", "ReviewID": "R1NG9PC6AJOQIV", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I have owned a rebel T3i, then upgraded to t4i because of the STM feature.  Since then, I have bought a 17-50 f2.8 lens, a 30 mm f1.4 lens, 18-55 stm and a 70-300 lens.  the problem that I have which everyone would share is the bulk of the dslr especially when traveling.To me it is a no brainer to buy a camera this size, almost a point and shoot camera, with APSC size sensor (much larger sensor compared to micro 4/3, nikon 1 system and sony rx100) for just $299!  And if you add to that a 22mm (35mm equivalent) bright f 2.0 lens, then this is an excellent value.  Not only that, the firmware upgrade which is already installed in the camera fixed the slow focus issue that plagued this camera.In my experience, I have more fun composing my shots when using a prime lens than a zoom lens, and with this I get really what I want -- excellent image, light camera and bright compact lens -- everything else like buttons, flash and EVF I can live without. So it is fun for me to be able to carry this light camera and get excellent results as if I am carrying my rebel t4i, because performance wise, these two are essentially the same.  The only difference is that the EOS M has less bulk and less buttons.  I honestly don't mind losing the buttons because the touch screen works fine for me.This is also good for my wife who always makes mistakes using my dslr.  With this, I could just set it in the auto function and she could just use it like a point and shoot.  I am ok with that for her because I know that image quality would still be excellent.Now, I am hoping that third party lens makers like sigma and tamron would build compatible lenses.  If I can just get a prime f1.4 lens specifically made for this camera, then I would definitely be golden! I just get excited thinking about that possibility for a smallish APSC camera! So hopefully I get my wish before xmas.", "Date": "July 9, 2013"}, {"Title": "BEST KIT FOR THE MONEY IN TERMS OF Image Quality", "Author": "Shawn C.", "ReviewID": "R1RVLSH9K7JLTQ", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I heard so many negative things about Canon EOS M so I stayed away from it for long time.  Auto focus speed, lack of EVF option, Controls, lack of native lens selection, initial price, and the list goes on.  Well, prices have come down drastically and my curiosity got the best of me as I heard that image quality was that of T4i which is very good.  I went with this 22mm f/2 kit instead of 18-55mm zoom because I personally like the image quality and the speed of the prime lenses over the zoom ability.  Image Quality is foremost important to me.  22mm f/2 which is near 35mm equivalent in full frame and has fast f/2 aperture (not much difference between f/2 and more typical f/1.8, but there is big difference between f/1.8 and f/2.8).  f/2.8 primes while the IQ is typically better than a zoom, speed and DOF control isn't much different from a good f/2.8 zoom lenses.  I am so glad Canon went with f/2 instead of f/2.8.  I love the bokeh and ability to isolate subject with this lens as well as low light capability paired with the ASP-C sensor.  It's one sharp lens that I wouldn't mind paying for entire price of the camera kit for.  Sony and M43 versions of 35mm equivalent primes with at least f/1.8 aperture (since they don't make f/2) costs more than the entire EOS M Camera kit.  Even if you already have Olympus, Panasonic, or Sony Nex, I would get this kit just for this lens.  22mm f/2 is pancake lens making the entire camera jacket pocketable.  Great.Now, as for image quality, it's GREAT.  Paired with 22mm f/2 Canon EOS M is able to produce beautiful sharp images.  35mm is most versatile range in my opinion.  The entire kit cost $300 - 350.  Wow.  Try to get ASP-C sensor Mirrorless body with a \"fast\" pancake prime and see how much it cost you.  M43 has Olympus 17mm f/1.8 $400-500 alone and Panasonic 20mm f/1.7 for around $300-400 used or new.  Again slightly faster aperture is negated by smaller sensor compared to larger sensor on Canon when looking at low light and shallow DOF.  Sony Nex has Zeiss 24mm f/1.8 premium lens that costs around $700-1000.  Nothing cheaper if you are looking for around 35mm range prime with near f/1.8 aperture.  I currently use Olympus m43, but I picked up this kit as it hits that 35mm fast prime void for $100 less.As for the CON of this kit.  Canon EOS M does have much slower AF.  It got better to be tolerable from what I hear, but \"compared\" to other options, it's definitely slower.  Not for moving subjects.  I was planning to use this kit for still subjects so that's no problem.  The control is kind of bad, but it can be considered ok or even good only if you don't mind using the touch screen to change your settings instead of buttons.  I personally got used to using the touch screen and come to like it.  No built in Flash. (I real like the convenience of those tiltable build in flashes).  I do like those tiltable displays for creative shots or candid shots.  It would have been great if it had it.  No EVF option.  Well, at initial price this was a problem, but with current prices, that is comparable to other mirrorless in this price range.All it all, I say give it a try.  Not much to lose with these prices.  Don't get anything else even if you have other Canon lenses.  This kit is perfect as it is with its limitations for current PRICE.  Buying flash, 18-55mm (maybe this is ok since it's cheap as well), or the adapter kind of spoils the bargain aspect with little gain.  If you have other Canon lenses that means you have a DSLR Body.  Why would you use it on this camera with the limitations mentioned?  Portability?  As soon as you put that large lens on save 40mm f/2.8, it becomes an awkward set up.  Don't do it.  Flash?  maybe... hopefully with f/2 and its high iso capability, you don't need one.  Canon EOS M currently isn't so great if you are looking to \"grow\" your system.  There are MUCH better options.Get it for stand alone 22mm (35mm equivalent) f/2 set up with maybe addition of 18-55mm.  I would not get  the 18-55mm bundle over this one as Sony Nex 3N or F3 kit is better than Canon EOS M 18-55mm kit in terms of value for features including similar image qualities for similar price.  Canon EOS M only becomes incredible value for those who appreciates 35mm fast prime as you can't get one at this price on any other system with this good of image quality any where.  I am saying this 22mm f/2 kit for the price is a five star, and not EOS M if you disregard the price.", "Date": "February 25, 2014"}, {"Title": "Good Deal!", "Author": "nicholas Richardson", "ReviewID": "R3C7UKE00I9MKL", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "I love this camera, but not everyone will.Buy this camera if:1.

So far this camera has been a gem, but with the 22mm lens there is no infinity setting so shooting the milky way isn't easy.

I just hope the iso noise wont ruin the shot (so far I feel it handles well at higher iso)", "Date": "October 14, 2013"}, {"Title": "Great Back-Up for the SLR", "Author": "Rachel Barr", "ReviewID": "RBJNUYI67309B", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "I like this little camera a lot. Image quality and resolution are top notch, colors are natural and the camera's compact build is very handy.I would give EOS M a sound five-star rating except for some things that hamper my shooting style, and some are points I wish I'd read about in online reviews - but didn't see anything about. I won't harp on the slow autofocus. Or any of the other issues that have been ground to death. With the firmware update, autofocus is - for the most part - snappy enough for my needs. The camera's a little slower to focus with the 22mm pancake lens than it is with the 18-55 (I have both), but overall its performance is quite satisfactory.I don't use movie mode frequently, but when I do, it makes wonderfully smooth videos with nice stereo sound.For my personal shooting style, things that could stand improving:1. In the creative modes (Program, Aperture Value, Time Value and Manual), manual ISO settings are restricted to 100, 200, 400, 800, 1600, 3200 and so on. There's not a way to set the sensitivity between these stops. In many instances a sensitivity between 800 and 1600 would be plenty sufficient, as well as between 1600 and 3200. But you're forced to the next full stop on the menu, and unnecessary noise is introduced into the image. It would be so helpful to be able to stop at 640 or 1000, for instance, ISO settings I frequently use on my EOS 60D.Put into Auto ISO mode, the camera will sometimes select a sensitivity that works to best advantage, noise-wise, and sometimes it doesn't, but it's always worth the try because the camera itself CAN select an ISO setting between the manual ones, and sometimes it is a better alternative than the user defined settings. The down side here is that in Auto ISO mode, the highest sensitivity is restricted to 6400. It's really not that much of a down side, though, because beyond 6400 noise is too unacceptable, in my view, to be used except in extreme situations, anyway.2. No Vari-Angle LCD. If you've never used one, then you won't miss it. But over the years I have chosen Canon cameras over other brands for this really indispensable feature. Of course Canon build and image quality also matter, but that flip-and-twist LCD is the final selling point for me. This feature takes shooting to a whole new level of outright fun and adds a dimension of creativity to shooting that cannot be achieved otherwise. Not only does the articulated LCD provide a superior way to shoot low-level, waist-level and over-the head shots, but I find it also adds a measure of stability when shooting two handed at slower shutter speeds. So a solid star off for this missing feature.3. No built-in flash. While I do prefer existing light photography to flash photography, sometimes a built-in flash is plain handy. How hard would it have been to include one? Taking along an external flash really sort of defeats the point of carrying a compact camera.4. No viewfinder. This isn't much of an issue unless I'm shooting with the lens adapter and an EF or EF-S lens. The balance of the camera is thrown off some, and it's heavy with a standard sized lens attached. The stabilizing effect of pressing the camera against my brow would be of significant benefit here. It's almost the same as holding an SLR out in front of you and trying to get a clear, well-framed shot. Doable, but not an easy thing. Also in bright light, the LCD is a tad hard to see, and a viewfinder would be welcome!5. Focus point is too large for some shooting. There's no way to adjust the size of the focus point for fine details. This becomes an issue when shooting macro or scenes with details like the lettering on signs, or grass blades, or tree leaves, or cactus spines. You know, details. (You CAN magnify the area where you wish to focus and pinpoint a smaller area, but it takes extra time and still does not always focus where you want.)6. It would be nice to have a setting for off-camera, wireless flash.Don't get me wrong, though. I am truly enjoying the camera. Image quality is really very good, especially when shooting RAW and post-processing images with Digital Photo Professional (the supplied software), Lightroom or Photoshop. For me image quality is the bottom line. I'd rather use a quirky camera that takes great pictures than a blazing fast hip-shot model that takes ho-hum ones.Speaking of Lightroom, you'll need a version later than Lightroom 3. That program does not support EOS M raw files (or G1 X either). You'll need a later version. I'm using LR 5.This camera body IS compact, actually a bit smaller than my S90. With the 22mm lens attached, it's really a small package, smaller than the G1 X with its built-in lens.For the most part, I am very pleased with the EOS M. It's a handy little addition to my kit and goes with me pretty much everywhere. Dynamic range, resolution and color are all very pleasing, and the few quibbles I have with it are just that. Quibbles.I am very interested to see what changes Canon has made with the EOS M2, the as-yet unannounced successor that is showing up on the list of supported cameras in their latest editing software version. If the new model has a Vari-Angle LCD, as much as I like the EOS M, it will promptly go on the auction block. Here's hoping for an EOS M with a Vari-Angle LCD!", "Date": "October 6, 2013"}, {"Title": "Under appreciated for its video capabilites", "Author": "B. Elmore", "ReviewID": "R2LNHUN03HAFOP", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I've owned a D90 for several years and was initially excited about its video capabilities. Unfortunately, the D90's video is crippled. It exhibits terrible rolling shutter and can't autofocus while in video mode. Manually focusing it (without the assistance of features like those provided in Magic Lantern -- which isn't available for the D90) proved more or less impossible for me. I actually later purchased a 5100. It was improvement, but it still fell far short of my expectations. I was left hoping Nikon's next generation would fit the bill. But even if it did, I was happy with the D90 as still camera and wasn't looking forward to dropping another $1000+ on new body just so I'd have a camera that was competent in both still photography and video.I took a gamble and picked up an EOS M. I'm loving it! It's almost exactly what I was looking for. It produces gorgeous video with virtually no rolling shudder. It's not without flaws, but I think it is being way under appreciated, at least at its current price point (~$350 with a lens).Sure. I love how rapidly I can fire off shots with the D90, but EOS M's speed is not nearly as slow as I expected based on the reviews (even those based on the updated firmware). I never been terribly attached to all the dials and buttons on the D90 either, so I have no issues with the touch interface. I don't know if I like it better or worse. It's just different.Unfortunately, the battery life is indeed pretty terrible. I can't actively use this camera more than a couple of hours without completely draining the battery,I opted for the kit with the 22mm lens and although it's motor is almost inaudible to my ears while shooting, it's not inaudible to the camera's mic. If you don't relay on autofocus though and manually focus instead, the mic likely will not pick up any noise. Unfortunately, that's what you'll probably need to do in lot of cases anyway, because the M often has to hunt for focus when you change subjects.I'd strongly recommend using Magic Lantern (a freeware firmware hack) with this camera as it adds several enhancements, including the ability to raise the bitrate of video (I've been able to increase it to 3x with audio disabled at 1080p/24 and 30fps using a SanDisk Extreme 32G 45MB/S SDHC card). Magic Lantern's \"focus peaking\" and \"magic zoom\" functions are also invaluable in evaluating proper focus.UPDATE:With more hands-on use, I was becoming more disappointed with this camera because of issues with autofocusing. When shooting video in any autofocus mode, it's quite noticeable when the camera is \"hunting\" for focus. Even with still photography, the autofocus gave me occasional problems because it would lock focus on the background rather my intended foreground subject. What I didn't realize is these issues seem to be more related to the 22mm lens than the camera. Recently, I added the 18-55mm kit lens and have found that when it has to hunt for focus, it's not nearly as noticeable. Another bonus is the kit lens is not as noisy as the 22mm.Battery life seems much better now than my initial experience. I'm not sure if this is because I'm using the camera less intensively, the battery has improved with charge/discharge cycles or perhaps I'm using my spare Opteka LP-E12 more than my original battery. I've been very pleased with the Opteka's performance, BTW. I'd say it matches or betters the OEM battery.UPDATE 2:Another one of my complaints with shooting video with this camera would be the audible noise of the lens focusing. When shooting some video from a tripod, I noticed the (almost) complete absence of any noise while focusing. I later realized why this was. When I was shooting handheld, the index finger of my left hand was partially covering the microphones on the top of the camera! Re-positioning my finger makes the noise from either lens nearly inaudible. I've noticed that the noise, though less noticeable, seems constant with the kit lens, whereas the noise stops with the 22mm after it gets focus lock.", "Date": "October 3, 2013"}, {"Title": "Magic Lantern Brings This Camera Alive!", "Author": "Christian Fiore \"BlueBomberTurbo\"", "ReviewID": "R1LQD59EW60RLM", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "*** Note that this review is based on the HIGHLY discounted pricing starting in summer '13. ***This camera is basically what you'd get if you dropped the sensor and Live View autofocus of a DSLR into a point and shoot body.  That is, limited controls, slow(er) autofocus, and full DSLR image quality.  For the original $800 asking price, it's plain absurd, considering current Micro 4/3rds cameras match the size and image quality (some even beat it) for the same price, with MUCH more flexibility and control. For the new low price, though, it's completely acceptable.The build quality is top notch, with almost all metal construction.  Put this next to a Micro 4/3rds camera, just about any one of them, and they'll feel like toys in comparison.  This thing is a brick.  It's heavier than you'd expect, but nowhere near a DSLR's weight.The controls are very limited, mainly mapped to the touchscreen.  The interface, however, is extremely snappy, rarely leaving you waiting, so the lack of physical controls isn't as infuriating as it seems.Shooting can be slow, as expected of a Live View style focusing system.  The camera's burst rate is 4.3fps with no continuous autofocus (less than 1fps with), with about a 5-7 shot buffer (depending on the card you use).  When shooting burst, the screen blanks out.  Once you hit the buffer, you have to wait about 4 seconds for it to clear.  During this time, the screen's blanked out again.  This is definitely not sports camera.As far as image quality, yeah it's the same sensor that Canon's been using in its consumer DSLRs for the past 5(!) years, and that age shows.  Very minimal highlight and shadow recovery, with pretty bad banding if you push the shadows more than about 1 stop.  The sensor resolves detail generally well considering its age, though.  High ISO noise is acceptable up to about ISO 3200, then falls off dramatically with sensor heating magenta color casts in shadows at ISO 6400 and above.  The 22mm F/2.0 is almost a necessity.Here's where Magic Lantern (an SD Card based hack) comes in!  Magic Lantern has a TON of hacks/upgrades, mostly based around video, but some for photo, and some that work on both.  Focus peaking and Magic Zoom will let you grab perfect focus almost instantly using manual focusing, opening up a world of cheap vintage lenses to choose from (with the right adapters).  Expose To The Right (ETTR) modifies the camera's exposure metering, making sure you don't blow out any needed highlights.  Dual ISO gets you a single-shot HDR image (though it halves the resolution).  Bracketing, intervalometer, motion detect shutter trigger, adjustable bulb exposure, hyperfocal distance calculator, and flash compensation round out the major photo features.For video, don't even get me started.  You'll save thousands of dollars by using Magic Lantern instead of buying other accessories that do the same thing.  Just remember to get a fast SD card (45MB/s bare minimum) if you want to up the video bitrate or record in full RAW.Most of these features aren't even available on top of the line DLSRs, and are indispensable once you're used to them.  Even better, there's literally a TON of adjustability for each feature.  You can custom tailor almost each one to fit your needs at any given time.If you're just looking to upgrade from a point and shoot, or want a generally inexpensive travel camera with good image quality, this is the camera for you.  Compact and generally light with solid build, all it lacks is weather sealing.If you're coming from a DSLR, don't get your hopes up.  This is a point and shoot with a DSLR sensor, not a DSLR stuffed into a point and shoot sized body.  Magic Lantern will help a lot, but this is more of a compact portrait/landscape camera than a sports/animals/kids DSLR, and the sensor's limits can't be completely ignored (unless you're coming from a consumer Canon DSLR).If you're looking for a cheap camera body to record video, there are lots of other options out there with MUCH higher quality (even in RAW).

The best camera is the camera you have with you.  I am glad I don't have to default to my iphone5 whenever I am out and about and I am inspired to shoot some photos.  The EOS M does great indoors with low light if you have the pancake lens and raise your ISO to about 1600.

I almost ended up spending $650 for the Sony RX100 but luckily held back when Sony announced the release of RX100 Mark 2.  When I saw the fire sale for Canon EOS-M  camera with APS-C sensor with a low light  f2.0 35mm equivalent lens at $299, the deal was too irresistible to pass on and since this was sold by amazon, there was absolutely no risk and drama if I was not satisfied and had to return the item.About the size, I was surprised that I could fit the camera in my straight leg relaxed fit jeans but you can definitely feel the heft of the well built camera. A light jacket will be ideal if you don't want people to stare at your jeans :) AF performance is more than adequate with the new firmware release and I don't really know how bad it was before.The camera does gets confused on where to focus when you try to do macro with AF Single point. I do agree with other reviewers that this is not a camera for sports but for general people photography and landscapes this is no brainer for the price. Just disable the Dynamic AF and enable single point AF for faster performance.The pictures and video come out great with nice bokeh and like many I just use the professional PASM modes and only shoot in RAW. The touch screen is super responsive and sharp and you will not miss the viewfinder. I would definitely advice having a spare battery.  The lack of inbuilt flash is not an issue with the fast f2.0 lens and the ability to push the ISO to 3200 without any noticeable grain in the pictures.

The two kit lenses are very good, and it could use EF lenses, and that's really all it had going for it.But, at $300 - now we're talking. While the EOS's elderly sensor may not compare very well to other system cameras such as NEX and M4/3, it blows any camera you can buy at a similar price point out of the water. The sensor is 8 to 12 times larger than a compact camera's sensor - result being greater detail, lower noise, and better low light performance. No contest. And, as mentioned before, both kit lenses are very, very good - you would be paying $300 or more apiece for an equivalent using another system.The touch screen is essentially optional in operation - you can use physical buttons to do just about everything aside from switching mode. That being said, the touch screen is very good; along the lines of a good phone screen in terms of sensitivity.The major patch in june seems to have resolved a lot of issues, but some software glitches remain, such as the long black screen after taking a shot. Setting continuous shooting mode can help with this. It'd be nice to be able to reassign the record button, too.Autofocus is adequate. Not great, not horrible. You will need to prefocus the camera (and/or use manual focus) if you want any hope of capturing motion, such as an athlete or child. However, this isn't really a knock against the EOS; nothing can compete with a DSLR's autofocus (yet).The only point I can outright bash is Canon's pricing of accessories. 45$ for a spare battery. 190$ for the adapter to use EF lenses - little more than some machined metal. 100$ for a mediocre flash, 170$ for a decent one. 20$ for a remote. Something like 400% markup going on here; you can get clone versions of most of the above for 1/4 canon's price. Come on, canon.The flash or lack thereof is a major shortcoming on canon's part; the 90EX (retail: 99$) flash was created specifically for the EOS M, it's weak, has no AF beam, and cannot be rotated or tilted - size is the only redeeming factor.

This a great inconspicuous camera that doesn't really need a flash. I have used the Canon 580 EXII flash on the EOS-M and although it is twice as big as the camera, it produces well balanced flash exposures with full flash control available on the camera's touch screen. The touch screen interface takes some getting used to if you are coming from the 35mm SLR world. This camera is not designed to be all things to all people or the only camera one should have; but the ability to use full sized Canon lenses with the adapter is a compelling factor.For those complaining about the slow focusing, turn off the continuous autofocus feature in the main menu and it focuses much faster. Focus modes are AF/MF/AF+MF, continuous/off, one shot/servo, face+tracking/flexizone area/flexizone spot. Finding the right combination of focus modes is critical to your shooting style. The 22mm f/2 lens is slower to focus with it's very narrow depth of field but it is a sharp lens. Focusing is much faster with the 18-55 3.5-5.6 IS STM lens. With my vision I find focusing easier with the touch screen than with viewfinders.I have not fully tested the video capability with the EOS-M but it does feature HD video with continual autofocus and focus tracking during video. It has a 3.5 jack for external microphones.There are several auto scene modes basically available for jpeg only shooting like HDR backlight control that will take a 3 shot bracketed series and blend them in camera into one image. You can use auto bracketing in RAW mode and process the images yourself. There is also a multi-shot noise reduction mode available for jpeg shooting along with handheld night scene mode (multi-shot). I have tested these modes and they work as advertised. I prefer RAW shooting and process my own bracketed images.The naysayers are wrong concerning this camera.

Having grown up on full sized 35mm film cameras I like to shoot with two hands - the 18-55mm gives me something to hold as well.

I also shoot Nikon and Panasonic cameras. I wanted to buy the EOS M when it first came out but like everyone else, I was scared away by all the bad reviews on the auto focus speed.  With the price drop and the new firmware, I decided to take a chance.  The camera arrived 2 weeks ago with the 18-55mm lens.  The first thing I noticed was the nice look and feel of the camera.  The camera came with the new firmware installed so I assume this particular camera was just produced this year.  The first shots were fireworks pictures at night at the beach. The pictures were very nice even though they were shot at ISO 1600.  I could have used a lower ISO but didn't since this was just a test.  I think in the low light, this camera shoots as least as good as my Canon 60D but definitely not as good as the 5D MK II.  That's pretty good!  Regarding shooting in manual, I did not find setting the ISO, shutter speed, or aperture difficult with the touch screen.  It's not difficult, just different. I could get used to this.  If you just push the INFO button, you can change most of the key settings very quickly by pressing that item twice.I shoot mostly pictures of people.  The next test was at a dinner in a restaurant.  Here's where I had speed issues with the camera.  Taking one picture was OK.  When I say OK, I mean there is still a very slight delay before the picture is taken.  I did miss some pictures of my grandkids as they moved after the shutter button was pushed but before the shutter actually tripped.  The most trouble came when taking pictures in succession since the screen \"blacks out\" between shots.  During that time, you cannot see what is on the screen so you need to recompose when the screen comes back and then press the shutter again to capture the picture.  For even just slow people movement, this is a problem.  I even tried turning off the picture review and changing some settings other people on the internet have suggested to make the camera faster.  The speed was still too slow when taking mulitple shots in succession.A side note, as a mirror less camera, the shutter is very loud.  Maybe even louder than a regular DSLR.  With great reluctance, I returned the camera to Amazon this week.  I really wanted to like this camera.

For the serious armature, this is a great little camera.  For the professional photographer, this is a nice little camera to have in pocket for unexpected photo opportunities.As for me, I would have given up everything to become a professional photographer with such a camera and set-up with my computer system.  That is to say fifty years ago.  But still, this little camera is amazing even today.  And a new version will appear on the market maybe soon that will be even better.  But the price will ago up significantly.The objections critics raise against the slower focusing are those wonderful idealists.  Lots of cameras I have handled are slower than this.  The reviewer who reported  4-5 seconds to focus is very suspect.  My experience has been solid focusing in less than one second.  True, this is not fast enough for sports, but for most anything else, it is just fine.I recommend buying the 18-55mm zoom lens instead of buying the adapter to use with your other Canon EOS lenses.  It just doesn't make sense to me to attach heavy lenses on this little doll of a camera when I have the well balanced Rebel T2i and T4i cameras.  I made the mistake of buying the off brand adapter (which works perfectly) and can now use all my EOS lenses on the M camera bodies.  But I've decided to use only the STM lenses on my M camera. I can't see putting a big lens on this small camera.The M camera has no built-in flash, but it does have a hot shoe.  This will work perfectly with my Canon 270EX Speedlite. and, if needed, with my larger Speedlite.  This is my personal preference.  I hardly ever use flash.  It's just that a hot shoe is so much more versatile and effective than a built-in flash.  The tiny opening on the camera face, that I thought might be a flash, is just a beam to help the camera auto focus.The 22mm lens is very sharp, and  an aperture of f 2.0 , coupled with the camera's ability to use high ISO's  low light shooting is easy. The sweetest sweet spot is f 8. The sensor and processer really do their jobs.  I could never get such sharpness and detail with any tiny sensor camera.  And the M does shoot RAW+JPG.  With the M camera you get an easy to carry, easy to use camera, and high quality photographs.  And it's only a little slower in focusing than optimal for some uses.UPDATE 12/18/13I forgot to mention before about the lack of a viewfinder.  After some use of this camera, I miss it.  Especially if I were trying to use the camera for sports, or moving dogs at the Dog Park,  I usually press a camera against my face to steady it when I shoot, but the Image Stabilizer works very well if the camera is held properly - as shown in the User Guide.  Additionally, I push the camera away from me to cause the neck strap to pull on the back of my neck.  That creates kind of a tripod effect with my body.  But still, I often have a problem with direct sunlight obscuring my subjects.  I've tried a specially built shade device, but it was too clumsy to be useful.I also hadn't mentioned the Touch Screen.  Well, it's fast and great.  I mostly like being able to touch the screen to guide what the camera is to Auto Focus on.

Along the way I also started looking at updating my DSLR (Canon EOS Rebel T2i) for one with more advanced features. At some point I noticed the EOS-M. I read the reviews and it seems there was a problem with the focus on early models, and it seems word got out, because Canon slashed the price. At some point they updated the firmware and fixed the focus problem, but it looks like the damage was done. The first few hits on Google all pointed out the focus problem, even though it had been fixed.I bought it mainly for shooting video and for quick \"snapshot\" shooting, both tasks it performs well. I use a Sennheiser MKE 400 shotgun mic mounted to the hot shoe for audio, with very good results. It is able to find faces and track them across the scene and maintain focus fairly well. Shooting in low light is very good, but like any camera, the more light the better the image. If you're used to Canon DSLRs you'll have no problem navigating the menus and buttons.The lens adapter that lets you use DSLR lenses is nice, but very expensive when compared to the (now low) price of the camera. It does not allow for remote control. This is a real shame, because mating this to an app like DSLR Controller (in the Google Play Store) would be nearly perfect.

I was pleasantly surprised after unpacking this camera because for this price I didn't expect the built quality to be that good. Nothing wobbles or feels flimsy and it feels almost like a brick in your hand, solid.Besides the solid built quality, the camera doesn't overwhelm the user with functions that are hard to remember how to use them. The touch screen works very good and I especially like that one can touch anywhere on the screen to focus at any point in the picture.The focusing process is not super fast, but subjectively faster than I am used to from this type of camera. Also very impressive is the backlight HDR function which when selected, will take three pictures at different exposure values and merge them together to produce a picture with the correct exposure.To do so, it is usually required to use a tripod, but this HDR feature allows you to take the pictures free handed and merge them together sharp and crisp. I truly appreciate this function because all too often did I find myself in situations that demanded HDR exposure, but I didn't have a tripod with me to get the desired results. With this camera this doesn't seem to be and issue any more.The lenses are equally well made and of impressive picture quality. The 18-55mm lens extends quite a bit but the tube does not wobble. The 22mm lens is very compact and only slightly extends during the focusing process. Close-up pictures taken with the 22mm lens render a very nice background blur.In summary, it is a real pleasure to hold that piece of \"high-tech\" in your hands, it feels solid, takes nice pictures, and induces the confidence of having a very good product.", "Date": "August 8, 2013"}, {"Title": "Awesome Camera for great photographs!", "Author": "Amazon Customer \"Techno Geek\"", "ReviewID": "RE3GUAOWKGENV", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "This is an awesome pocketable camera that is small and lightweight that I am willing to carry with me anywhere. I already have the trusty Canon 5D Mark II and used to have the Canon Powershot S100 for pocketable camera that was stolen from my car and was going to replace it until I saw the deal on this camera. I did not consider this camera before due to the price and the negative reviews it received regarding the autofocus speed that was slow. But when the price went down to LESS than GoPro3 black edition (of which I also have) and to within the price range of the awesome but stolen Powershot S100, then it made me consider getting this camera and boy am I glad I got it!Main purpose of a good camera is taking great pictures, right?. EOS M does a marvelous job at a level you expect from a prosumer DSLR. This compact camera has the LARGEST chip of any affordable compacts with APS-C sized chip. Sony Rx1RB has full size chip but it costs several thousands of dollars. Why the size of chip matter? Larger chip gets you better picture. That is why DSLR takes better pictures than smartphones.Several reviewers in photographic magazines complained of lack of buttons and instead EOS M relies on touchscreen menu to get where you want to. My experience is that it is easier to navigate the options with the M than the Powershot S100 in which there were quite a few buttons and knobs but still complicated to get where you want to go to, if you remember where to find it.Autofocus: There has been much criticism on the slowness of the focusing capability of this camera. Mine came in with the latest update and the focusing was slower than my Canon 5D mark II. So I had to adapt to it and be aware of that when taking pictures. I just know I will not get the sports pictures. For that, I can use the 5D mark II which by the way it is not that fast compared to the newest version, the III.Right now there is no USB remote control capability with EOS M using the Android Apps like DSLR controller. Apparently it is crippled by Canon. Magic Lantern is working on a solution and right now is it in Alpha stage. So it looks like that in the future it could be done! Canon can change its mind and make it so that it is USB control capable like the 5D mark II or III or the newer Rebels and other EOS.There has been discussion online with defects on certain EOS M that right side of pictures are washed out. I checked mine and it was fine. Something you need to check if you get one.Would I recommend this camera? That depends on what kind of pictures you take and what is your expectation. It is possible it may be too slow for family/kids pictures and many point and shoot cameras could be better and more inexpensive than this unit. But if you are into the art and love of photography for art's sake, this camera can bring you to that level in a compact form.Addendum: As to which lens you should choose,I chose 22 mm lens because of its physical size it made it more compact. Since I already had other Canon lenses for my 5D mark II and with the optional EOS M EF adapter, I can attach any telephoto lenses. If you are planning it to be your main camera and you do not have other lenses, the 18-55 may be a good choice but you lose the compact factor and note the autofocus speed may not be adequate if you have children to take pictures unless they learn to be still. Since my smartphone Nokia N8 only had one focal point, I learned to crop a lot. So with the 22 mm lens, I know I can crop my pictures since I take them in raw format, so it would not lose information to get great pictures.Addendum 2 from Nov 2013. I got the refurbished Canon lens EFS 18-135 mm with STM (step motor) and I was pleasantly surprised how fast the EOS M was able to focus compared to the 22 mm lens.

Supposedly it is the smallest crop sensor camera on the market and it has a flash.  Here's my issues with the 3n:  First, the flash is pretty much useless.  Don't expect even lighting from it.  No hotshoe to use an external flash. The kit lens is way too slow.  The flash button doesn't work half the time.  And worst of all, the interface is terrible.Then I bought the eos m.  If I'm not mistaken, the eos m has a magnesium body vs the Sony plastic body.  It feels much better to hold.  The touch screen interface is 25x better than the Sony.  Yes you have to buy an external flash but at least you'll get decent photos indoors.  With the fast prime, you can get decent shots even without the flash.  I might even sell the T4i.  Like I said, I'm not a pro.  I usually shoot in aperture priority mode.  But even I could tell immediately that this camera took much better photos in low light than the Sony.

I had the Canon G1x and found it to fall short and read that the EOS M delivered. True enough, image for image the EOS-M delivers higher quality results and that is where it ends. I fear Canon did not think this one thru. It falls way short of the other mirror less cameras on the market.

People are always surprised when they go to pick it up, expecting something flimsy, like an early 2000's point-and-shoot. The body is a magnesium-alloy, which is slick to the grip, but very resistant to damage. The only adornments made to the body for ergonomics are two small grips placed one on the front and one on the back.Startup time is quick, about a second, and once you figure out the interface and modes, snapping pictures becomes about as easy as grabbing a shot from a phone. Coming from a DSLR, you may bemoan the lack of buttons and dials, but they have incorporated a number of things into the touchscreen interface. Picking a focus/metering point can be done with one touch, as can switching shutter/aperture/ISO values, and reviewing pictures after they're taken. I feel like Canon really did a great job of making the touchscreen interface an added benefit, rather than trying to shoehorn every function into it.Despite being on the newest firmware level, AF speed is still fairly pokey, but not dreadfully slow. Two reasons this isn't, and cannot, be as fast as a USM lens on a DSLR: First, STM means the focusing is driven by a STepping Motor, rather than an UltraSonic Motor. Because of the gearing, it takes longer to focus from near to far because it has to drive the ring the whole way, rather than whipping it back and forth. Second, because there are no dedicated phase detection spots (this is something that may be impossible to implement in a mirrorless design), Auto Focus is done on a trial and error basis. A change is made, and the camera detects whether it's picking up more or less contrast in that area. If turning the focusing ring one direction increases contrast, it assumes that turning it more will increase it even more until the picture is sufficiently \"in focus\". On the plus side, the camera rarely misses the focus point while it's hunting, so you're usually in good shape as long as you find a good spot to affix the AF point to.If you buy the EF(S) to M adapter, your USM lenses will still hunt using the contrast method, though you might find them to be a little quicker than the STM equivalent. I have yet to really test this.The ability to create RAW files from a tiny little portable camera is nice, but I do have to say that the JPEG files that come out of the EOS-M are amazing. The amount of shadow detail, color balance, and just overall tonal response are phenomenal. Don't let the lack of a flash dissuade you, this camera can take pictures in a dimly lit restaurant effortlessly. The noise reduction built into the camera is outstanding, and I find myself shooting in RAW+JPEG just because sometimes the JPEGs that it produces are what I had in mind for the shot in the first place.Let's talk ruggedness. My intentions with this camera were to shove it into my camelback and take it on bikes and hikes. I run across some amazing views while in the great outdoors, but there's no way I'm bringing a 5D Mk3 out on a 20 mile singletrack ride, or out on a waterfall hike. This camera lets me grab those stunning outdoor shots in a full 18MP, in RAW format so I can go back and recover that all-important shadow detail from terrain and highlight detail from the sky, and not have to worry about wrecking my main gear.It's also worth noting that while it lacks a built-in flash, it does have a hotshoe, which can drive most Canon speedlites. It looks really really goofy having this little camera with a flash twice its size attached to it, but it definitely will operate a Canon 600EX-RT and make for some truly awesome party pictures.", "Date": "August 9, 2013"}, {"Title": "Great camera in a small package!!!", "Author": "Garrett Jorewicz", "ReviewID": "R7ONVCBPO6EF7", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "I recently received my EOS-M and have had a few days to work with it in several different lighting environments.

I honestly believe that people must have had high expectations, hence they set themselves up to be let down.As others have mentioned, the shortcoming of this camera is the auto focus. You won't have much luck shooting sports or any fast moving activites using the camera's auto focus. It's just too slow for those applications. However, it is fine for nature photography, event photography, candid portraits, etc. You might miss a few \"moments\" here and there waiting an extra 1/4 - 1/2 second for the auto focus to do its thing, but again, this isn't billed as being super fast like the modern DSLR cameras we have grown accustomed to. This is about extreme portability without sacrificing image quality...That said, I've shot with the 50mm f1.2 L as well as the 24-105mm f4 IS L and the camera performed good, better than satisfactory, with each of those lenses. I was even using the 50mm 1.2 at night in a strip mall parking lot... Had no problem pulling focus what so ever. I was actually pleasantly surprised!I'm happy with my purchase. I did not buy it for sports or action photography...  I bought it as a 2nd camera to use for travel, hiking, parties, and as another camera angle for my video projects. This is the camera that I'll be taking to parties, happy hour gatherings, etc. And it will be on a video tripod with a nice L series lens at every live concert and wedding I shoot.You need to really evaluate your needs.

I simply don't have the time, but with the EOS M, I'm making the time. I spent quite a period of time researching cameras to fit my personal niche. As a long time owner of Canons (dating back to the AE1), I admit I'm biased, but my research had taken me to other manufacturers. My niche? I travel, have two young children (which means tons of stuff on trips), and simply had stopped taking my DSLRs with me except on special occasions. I was looking for a high quality camera to meet my artistic needs, that could be used as a point and shoot by my wife, and that had good video, as that is mostly what gets taken of the kids these days. Finally, I work in DC and had been thinking I would really like a small camera that fit in my brief case for some street photos. I had just about settled on the Fujifilm X20, but the 12 mp and no lens choice was holding me back. I had seen the M months before on Adorama, but then it disappeared and I began to think I had made it up (forgot the name - not listed on Canon site) until I found it on Amazon.I am so impressed with this little camera. It fits almost every need I have, and it takes my Canon lenses I have collected over time - bonus!! I have only had it on one test shoot in Napa for a couple days in January, but I can already tell that this is more than just an extra camera or the family's point and shoot. Don't fool yourself. There are so many features it will take a little time to figure out everything this camera can do, even in full auto mode. But features are secondary to the sold (heavy) feel and image quality that you get from the M. At the price, I would still be happy with half the features.So what are the negatives? There are several that you have to accept: No view finder and no through the lens view - I'm getting used to using the screen for everything. Battery life is horrible because the screen is always on - so I'm carrying three fully charged (at $7 each I'm accepting this). It has a frustrating habit of thinking I can't hold the camera steady enough to fire in some low light situations and won't let me - I'm learning more about the controls and figuring out how to override. Forcing fill flash takes some figuring out. The focus is slow - except that touch screen feature is pretty awesome! Medium size Canon lenses need a lens mount for the tripod - probably should have gotten these long ago anyway. Filter ring mount can be frustrating to get the threads to line up - I'm learning patience.But those negatives a outweighed by the incredible positives. And the bottom line is that I'm pulling the camera out a lot and carrying it in my pocket or briefcase all over the place (you'll want the 22 mm lens for portability, and the 18-55 for most other shooting).Finally, wish I had bought Busch's guide to the EOS M at the beginning instead of relying on the camera manual. And, check out the handheld night shooting program. It shoots 4 rapid shoots and combines into one. The results will really impress you.

The camera performs just fine; perhaps because I have the latest firmware installed designed to cure the performance issues.The EOS M fitted with the 22mm (35mm Full Frame Equivalent) Prime kit lens is a very small camera with image quality that is better than many expensive cameras.  The other kit lens; 18-55mm (29-87mm full frame equiv) is also quite small for a zoom type lens and surprisingly sharper than the 18-55mm mediocre Canon DSLR kit lens.  There is a very small selection of native lenses for the EOS M.  EF-S lenses (Canon DSLR) are compatible with the EOS-M using an adapter, but I have to believe that using a full sized lens would be awkward  on such a small camera (not to mention defeats the purpose of using such a small camera body).Unfortunately, there is no built in flash so some type of external flash is necessary ( I am not sure why such a small camera requires an external flash).  Some kits include a small external flash (mine did not).  But this kit external flash does not have a movable head and so it can not bounce the light; I strongly recommend the  270EX speedlight which is the perfect size and works great with this camera.  The 270 EX has bounce capabilities which greatly enhance the exposure and color rendition.Some important controls (Shutter priority and  Aperture priority for example) can only be accessed by the touch screen. I am old school and like actual buttons but after a short time, the touch screen was not difficult to navigate.Highlights:  Terrific Image Quality under all lighting conditions; Very small and portable especially with the 22mm lens; Great value; The 22mm prime kit lens is very sharp; Touch screen LCD works wellWhat can be improved:  LCD doesn't move; No viewfinder; No built in flash; No PASM Dial; Many controls have no buttons and are only accessible through touch screen; very small lens selectionThe price on this camera has fallen greatly and is now comparable to some compact cameras with small sensors.

Both issues are resolved with version 2.02 of the firmware and I am liking this little camera. The touch menus are a bit of a pain , but they have a shortcut menu that's quick and works well for most of your changes one would make on the fly (ISO, Shutter or aperture).

I used to have Pentax Q, NEX-5N, various Olympus bodies, Fuji X100 and now just Panasonic M43 bodies for video work, still haven't tried Nikon 1 yet.- The AF speed is definitely on the slow side, similar to Fuji before their firmware update. The 1/30s default shutter speed can induce blur a bit more than usual (as others use 1/60 which definitely have better chance of clear picture). On indoor it is harder to lock focus, sometimes took me many times to get it lock.- High ISO is definitely not as good as M43 machine with Sony sensor, there is quite a bit of noise and loss of detail at ISO3200, still but much better than other small sensor compacts and the pictures feel more solid.-The moire can be a bit of problem, before I got the camera I thought the moire is only shown on video, but boy I was wrong, on a few snaps indoor I already see moire on some shots, like clothes and on windows. I thought EOS-M have low pass filter?- Most annoying thing is the 2s blackout after taking a photo, so don't expect to get that many action shoot at all.- Battery life is on the low side too (around 200~250 snaps), so a 2nd spare battery is a must.- LCD is pretty good, the color and resolution (921K) is pretty nice, better than some competitor with only 460K screen. Higher resolution is useful for checking focus when using manual focus.- no build-in or snap on flash, while for some who don't really use flash/built-in flash this is no biggie, but for me a fill light can make a difference, no matter how small it is. (especially to get rid of shadows on the object/face). The 90EX need 2X AA battery unlike other snap on flash, and only offer slightly more flash output (GN9 vs GN 6-7 of similar mirrorless camera)- It is a world camera, meaning changing PAL <-> NTSC format for video on the fly, not many cameras does that.- Focus peaking with ML is pretty useful for focus pulling on video or using manual lens.- Video AF performance is ok, not as fast as other brand, though manual focus works much better for me.- Mic input - when paired with Sennheiser MKE-400 (smaller than videomic pro) you get pretty good audio, the default mic is ok but not outstanding. Much better than other cam without Mic input at similar range.  Especially when you shoot outdoor without deadcat on the mic the wind noise is pretty bad.- The 22mm F2 pancake prime on the other hand is what makes this camera worth it, the lens is pretty quiet and reasonably fast, though need to step down to F2.8 to get more sharper performance. But it is a pretty good focal length for everyday shoots, not too wide like 28mm (harder to make object standout) or too narrow like 50mm (can't really shoot people with landscape or indoor restaurant)- The bokeh from the F2 is pretty ok, not as good as the more expensive Panasonic 20mm F1.7 or the much more expensive Zeiss E24 F1.8, but for the price it is super bargain, cheaper than Panasonic 14mm F2.5 and Sony 20mm F2.8 while offer a much faster F2 speed.- for the price of $299 you can't even buy a fast prime from other mirrorless system (except Q which has smaller sensor), at its original $799 it was outrageously overpriced for the performance and spec, but at $299 it is one of the best bargain.", "Date": "August 4, 2013"}, {"Title": "Has its limitations but it truly taps the take-everywhere potential of APS-C.", "Author": "Jefenator", "ReviewID": "R2KAL03BL56IUB", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "First off, I would not recommend this camera as a serious workhorse.

This kit does a couple of things my NEX-7 does not do: 1) fit inconspicuously in a super-handy belt holster and 2) cost only $299 on closeout. These are two very significant points for me.Remarkably, the EOS-M kit does these things without a significant compromise in IQ! I get 18MP (absolutely plenty for my needs) of outstanding detail, all the way to the corners. Tested against the much-praised (and vastly more expensive and bulky) Sony/Zeiss 24mm I found the Canon 22mm offers similar sharpness and less CA and distortion!

First of all don't expect lightning fast AF.  My 7D is the king of AF in my bag but the EOS-M has similar speed to taking pictures in Liveview; Just a slight hesitation and sometimes there is a bit of seeking when in low contrast areas.  For stills it is a great camera with good quality looking pictures.  For action shots, it will be hard to keep up with moving images so framing is important.  The touchscreen works wonders, is responsive, and easy way to navigate through menus.  You wont miss having dials.  The STM lens is not the fastest lens but it is very quiet but not USM quiet.  The body feels solid and it feels well in my hands.  Overall the camera is fun to use.  Don't expect having a pocket size DSLR but this comes very close to it.  I would still take my DSLR to events just so I don't miss key moments but if you are taking casual pictures, I would not hesitate taking the Canon EOS-M.", "Date": "July 31, 2013"}, {"Title": "Beautiful Camera.

Except for the taking the picture part.The first thing I've ever ordered from Amazon with this kind of issue.***********UPDATE: got it back from the canon service center.  No charge (I paid to send, they paid to return, repair totally covered by warranty -- as I expected).  Really nice pictures over a couple days of shooting.  Great indoor performance with the f2 lens.  No issues with autofocus with the new firmware that I can see -- went for a couple of walks with it and (though I don't have a steadicam, so it is like most walking video) it stays nicely in focus.  Cameras are very personal sorts of things for most folks (as is probably obvious, I'm not a photographer) but what is most fun so far is the macro capability with the 22mm.  Spiders!  And of course, the APS-C sensor quality in a small camera.Anyway, wanted to update my review since I got it back and it's very nice.

I have also acquired the zoom kit lens.  This has been my go-everywhere camera, which I use instead of the cell phone.  The 22mm is in my view definitely the lens to get -- 100 percent crops are usually (if I haven't messed up the pic) crystal clear.  Shy owning something costing an order of magnitude more, I don't know how I could get better quality.  Just wanted to add, after some time and many thousands of pictures later, that I'm still really happy with it.  If you are thinking about the zoom, I'd say get an adapter and an 85mm fixed lens instead -- the 22mm spoils you with its sharpness, you realize what the camera can do, and the zoom is a huge step down.

It cannot compete with advanced (and much more expensive) compact such as Sony RX1, Fuji X100S, Ricoh GR to name a few, nor it can  compete with compact mirror less such as Sony Nex-6 (only 1/2 inch longer than EOS M with prime lens even though Nex-6 has a 16-50 zoom). However with more than 50% discount, it is cheaper than Nikon J1 and J2), Sony RX100 and RX100II, though the latter ones have inferior sensor sizes. It is even cheaper than many travel zooms such as Panasonic ZS30, Sony HX20V or HX50V. Only Sony Nex-3N is comparable. But Sony-3N is indeed cannot compare with EOS M (except it is more compact with 15-50 zoom compare with EOS M with 18-55 zoom). So with heavy discount, it is a best priced compact size APS-C sensor camera you can find. Period.With its prime 22 mm lens, picture quality is superb. After taking over thousands picture in various situations, I found the pictures are very sharp, saturated,  and clear. Without check EXIF, you cannot tell the difference between pictures taking from this and the one from Canon 5DII even at ISO 800. So very pleased with the IQ. The picture is sharp as it focused somewhere even though sometimes it may not the place you intended to due to its slow focus time (see below).Feature wise, touch shutter is quite nice and responsive/ But need to remember turning its off after use unless you want many unwanted pictures. Like any EOS, this camera is also full of manual and auto features and you may learn it quickly from reading the manual on how to use touch screen to get to various parts.No built-in flash is a minor complaint. But one can get a compact flash or use any existing Canon compatible flash. Lack of na\u00efve EF-M lens is another. The lens adapter works but not ideal. Besides, unlike Sony 15-50 mm pancake sized zoom for its Nex-6 and Nex-3N series, the Canon EF-M 18-50  mm zoom lens is quite bulkier. To be in compact size, one needs to use the EF-M 22 mm prime lens (which is superb).  So unlike Sony, the choice is very limited if going on compact. But the major complaint for this camera is its slow focus. Even after 2.02 firmware upgrade, it is still slow. As a result, on some practical situations,  many nice shots were missed or focused at wrong place due slow its focus time. This happens not necessarily on events with fast moving objects such as sports, but rather on many everyday events such as party or at dinner in a restaurant. To be fair, it doesn't happen very often. But even missing one or two, you will get them remembered in your mind.Overall, it is still the best compact sized camera (among sensor sizes from 1/2.3 to APS-C)  at $300 level.

I loved my NEX 7 it is an amazing piece of technology that churned out images that had a special film like quality.  However, the NEX system has one fatal flaw for me.  The Sony Raw developer software and 24mp files of the NEX 7 are brutally slow to work with(at least on Macs).

My main intention was for it to be a backup and travel camera in situations where my 5D Mark III would just be burdensome to carry.  The second reason why I wanted this was to have a compact camera that can produce HD video.  But on with the main question...\"How is the image quality with L glass?\"I own the 24L, 50L, and 135L, so I was eager to see how these lenses perform when adapted to the EOS-M.  The first and only test I performed was with the 24L and the answer was very clear - despite the M having a crop sensor on board, it still can't keep up with an image taken from a 5D3.  I know it's not a fair comparison because the 5D3 is over 10 times more expensive, but I still wanted to find out how wide the gap is and whether it is noticeable.The raw images taken through the 24L had colors that were noticeably desaturated, making the whole image look bland.  Beefing up the vibrance/saturation in Lightroom didn't cure the deficiency either, but rather made it look like a bad coloring job.  Also, I've seen sharper images from my Canon 50 1.4 wide open on my 5D3 than wide open on the 22mm pancake.  I was a bit disappointed with these results but for the price, you get what you pay for.Going forward with this purchase, I told myself that even if Canon never makes a single update to this camera, for $300, it's still a good deal for those situations where you'd like a nice photo that beats camera-phone quality.  Despite the low performance with L glass, I still stand by my decision.  This is still a great camera (especially with the latest firmware update) that is compact and inconspicuous.

My main purpose was to have a very small carry-around camera that I could keep in a pocket. This it is, provided you have a large pocket - a jacket pocket or the thigh pocket of a pair of painter's pants. So on that level I am completely satisfied.But what is it like to use? Being a long time Canon dSLR user, I expected to miss the viewfinder and I do. But not as much as I expected, and, after some use, I find the trade off for small size to be acceptable. Again, the touch screen and lack of manual controls and dials took some getting used to, but within a very short time I found myself shooting in my preferred mode, Manual, with relative ease.Image quality is as good as I get from my older Canon 7D, not unexpected given the similarity of the sensors used, although the 7D far outstrips the EOS M in responsiveness. Again, a trade off I can live with as I don't expect to be using the EOS M for shots requiring high speed acquisition. For more static picture taking, it is very good. Autofocus is not fast, but faster than that of some of my big lenses on much more expensive cameras, such as the 180mm f/3.5L Macro on a Canon 5D III. It is accurate and being able to use your finger to move the focus window quickly to the desired area of interest is an unexpected pleasure not found on my other cameras.It's well-built and easy to use. It's main advantage is its small size, especially with the 22mm f/2 lens. About point and shoot size, but with capabilities and a picture quality that outstrip most point and shoots, certainly those with small sensors.

The picture quality produced by the full-size APS-C sensor is *so much* better than even high-end digicams, with rich skin tones and blurry backgrounds that are simply not possible with the smaller sensors in those cameras.  And with the 22mm f/2.0 prime lens (my recommendation due to its utility in flashless indoor photography), it actually still fits into a large pocket.Think of it this way:  the 22mm lens retails for around $200 anyway, so during the best sales, you are essentially getting the camera body for $100.  At some later date, you can pick up the successor to the EOS-M, which will have superior focusing, and is rumored to come with an improved zoom lens.

The EOS M cameras focus pretty fast with the version 2 firmware, I went ahead and disabled the \"Continuous Auto Focus\" and selected the \"SinglePoint AF\" in the setup menu. And please pay attention to what you are focusing on, as the EOS M is quite picky in that regard, it will hardly focus on a white wall no matter how long I try (My Nikon J1 behaves similar, a drawback of PDAF maybe), unlike my DSLRs, which have no problem focusing on a white wall.", "Date": "July 10, 2013"}, {"Title": "Love it!

The choice of dedicated EOS-M lenses is fine and those looking to continue with existing EF lenses will find that the mount works brilliantly.I would recommend this to anyone who wants to take great professional looking photos and capture those unique photographic moments in life but doubts whether they'll really always have that 5 or 7D by their sides when it counts.

The image quality is Excellent! - No doubt this is due to the large 18MP APS-C sensor from the EOS Rebel DSLR line, coupled with the sophisticated image processing hardware and software.  All this fire power tucked into a tiny, highly portable package.2. The white balance engine is perfect under general ambient light. (Haven't had a chance to check the extreme mixes like daylight and tungsten)3. I like grabbing a camera and not having to think about proper modes.  This camera only has three modes: Total AUTO (Green), Creative Auto \"CA\" and MOVIE.  Which brings me to my only criticism so far:4.  I'd like a couple more modes like Tv and Av - (M would be great too) this would allow the camera to be used for astronomy work, creative landscape photography etc.5. With the optional adapter you have access to all your EF, EF-S lenses - this alone is worth the price of admission.****UPDATE****Regarding #4.  Cameron pointed out that Tv, Av and M modes are all accessible though the touch-screen menu.  I've tried this and it works!  So now I'm totally satisfied with this product.  It would be preferable (for me) if these modes were made available on the mode switch - but that's just a minor point.****See my photos of food and architecture in the photo gallery****CONCLUSION:The camera has a large sensor and is small enough to carry in your pocket with the 22mm STM lens attached, so it's a camera you'll have with you all the time.  It takes phenomenal photographs.  The AUTO presets NAIL the image in all types of lighting and lack of lighting EVERY TIME!

If you search for posts only in the past year, you will filter out the old issues related to slow firmware.In good light, the focus is fast. It has many features of, and the same sensor as, the Canon 18 megapixel DSLRs at much less cost. It can't replace a DSLR as the features are hidden in the touch-screen menus, but it is not meant to be a replacement, but a lightweight complement. My plan for this is to use it with EF lenses, and when I can afford a 6D, I'll use the same lenses on it. For now am getting some excellent shots with it.The 22mm lens that comes with this is really nice for low light shots and has good image quality. The 18-55 lens is better at the 18mm end. Be aware that the kit lenses are hard to use manual focus with - as when needed in very low light, or if doing astrophotography. The feature is enabled in the camera by pressing shutter button halfway, then rotating the lens ring. I recommend getting better lenses for manual exposure work. For someone who wants a step up from small sensor point and shoots, this kit with both lenses left on auto mode will make you very happy after a slight learning curve.There is no better value in cameras with a sensor of this size and quality.

Owning several EF lenses I have never considered any other mirrorless. Size is everything here and no viewfinder is fine with me since the camera probably couldn't be any smaller. At the current price of $549 current EF lens owners should not be put off by the slow auto focus, this camera can capture the \"decisive moment\" if you set it up correctly. Custom function 5 should be set to either 1 or 3, you need to get AF off the shutter button. Focus mode should be set to AF + MF and I like one shot AF and FlexiZone single. Also keep the screen touch shutter off. This setup enables you to change the focus point by touching anywhere on the screen and if you choose to use AF hit the * and in good light its really not that bad (bad enough for - 1/2 star though), or you can manually focus. At any time you can fire a shot and the shutter lag is not noticeable. I also have Magic Lantern Alpha installed and I think it is required (change custom function 6 to 2 to access Magic Lantern menu). Magic Lantern will enable 2 valuable features. 1st, ISO 160 increments (Canon should add this via firmware IMO - 1/2 star) and 2nd, Magic Zoom. I have Magic Zoom set at \"Always, small, AF box, 2:1\". The described setup works fantastic with STM and USM lenses that are full time manual focus. Unfortunately, my 50 1.8 and 35 f2, the 2 smallest EF lenses I own, don't work as well since they aren't full time manual focus. Once the MF switch is on you can no longer move the AF point by touching the screen, in that case I just leave the point on center. If its really bright out just use hyper focal. With the provided lens its a hack but effective. I used it like that to shoot video at an Easter Egg hunt on a small steadicam, carried it for hours no problem. It would be nice if Canon would add some kind of hyper-focal mode with STM lenses. Or even better a depth of field slider similar to an ios app I have used.This camera is small. It needs to be handled in person to really appreciate the size. The best camera is the one you have with you. The M will be with me much more than my 7d because of its size.", "Date": "March 31, 2013"}, {"Title": "My \"fixed-lens\", large-sensor compact", "Author": "philosoph", "ReviewID": "R1RUWHAM0CFS5B", "Overall": "3.0", "Content": "My usage: I'm using the EOS M + 22mm essentially as a fixed-lens, large-sensor compact camera to complement my existing m4/3 system. I wanted a something compact with a 35mm-e lens that would be easy to toss in another bag and that my wife would feed more comfortable using. With heavy discounts available, the EOS M seemed worth a try. My assessment follows\u2026Image quality: Good. The Canon sensor is venerable but capable. I'd give the edge to the smaller but newer sensor in my Olympus E-M5, especially in shadow noise, but it's slight.Build: I'm impressed with how solid the EOS M is. It's heavier than it looks, surprisingly so. The posts for attaching the strap can make it tricky to for a strap of your choice; I'm using a Gordy's string wrist strap and have had no trouble with it coming loose from the post.Controls & handling: The included grip is small but adequate for the 22mm lens. The EOS M relies heavily on a touch screen interface that is one of the best I've seen. The physical controls have some problems though. The rear dial is very easy to move accidentally, so I often find myself taking shots with my settings a bit off from what I'd intended; it is also impossible to adjust the rear dial while holding the camera in one hand. It would have been better for Canon to put the control dial around the shutter button instead of the mode dial. The movie button only works in movie mode, and is wasted in stills modes where an extra customizable function button would be really useful.Performance: Having updated to firmware 2.0.2 operational speed is just adequate. Compared to my Olympus E-M5 it's just slow. AF itself is slow and becomes slower if your subject isn't holding still and at closer focusing distances, e.g. head & shoulders portraits. There's also significant shutter lag between completing focusing and taking the exposure. Screen blackout after exposure is also too long. Combined, all this makes shooting fidgety subjects (kids) that are a breeze on my Olympus, challenging and sometimes frustrating on the EOS M.Shooting issues:-- There's no setting for slowest shutter speed for auto-ISO in Scene Intelligent Auto or Av mode. The EOS M uses a slowest shutter speed of 1/30 with the 22mm lens, which is fine for static subjects, but not fast enough when people are involved. Because of this I often need to avoid these modes with auto-ISO in anything but bright light. A novice using the camera in Scene Intelligent Auto mode may be disappointed with many pictures blurred due to subject movement. Being able to set the minimum shutter speed to 1/60 or 1/125 would made Av mode with auto-ISO much more versatile. Olympus offers this setting (though obscurely) on their cameras.-- Face detection is only available in tracking mode, which falls back to multi-zone AF if face detection fails. I'd prefer if face detection were available in single-zone AF mode, as on my Olympus, so there would be a predictable fallback AF position if face detection fails or when there are no faces in the scene. That would allow me to leave face detection on much of the time, instead of needed to specifically switch AF modes when I want to use it. As it is, setting single-zone AF position via the touch screen is so easy that I almost always use that instead of face detection.-- Unlike Olympus, Canon's face detection AF doesn't prioritize focus on the eyes, so the EOS M's face detection will often miss focus on the eyes when shooting with shallower depth of field, e.g. headshots at f/2, focusing on another part of the face instead of the eyes or on glasses instead of the eyes.-- Canon does not allow use of exposure compensation in M mode with auto-ISO. This makes M mode much less useful than it could be.Battery life: Shorter than I was expecting, but fine for my lighter usage. Were I taking the EOS M out as my primary camera for a day of shooting, I'd want an extra battery or two.Lens: The 22mm is excellent. See my separate review.Overall: I would not recommend the EOS M for someone looking for a mirrorless system camera: competitors' offerings are much stronger. But I'm happy enough with the EOS M for my intended usage basically as a fixed-lens, large-sensor compact given the (heavily discounted) price I paid. Image quality is very good with the 22mm lens, but the shooting experience falls short. It's especially disappointing that the camera tends to use too slow shutter speeds in Scene Intelligent Auto mode, making it much less suited to handing over to a novice such as my wife to use. Hopefully Canon will continue to make firmware improvements that can further improve AF and general responsiveness and correct some of the problems noted in \"Shooting issues\" above\u2014the EOS M could be much better than it is!", "Date": "November 6, 2013"}, {"Title": "Great addition to your large frame DSLR", "Author": "Greg Jordan", "ReviewID": "R2XWI9822JMTZ8", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I love this camera!

Too bad Canon stopped selling it in many parts of the world. I have to admit, though, that many cameras by reputable makers (and there are many) deliver what they promise. It is more about what camera traits you are looking for. So, I would suggest to anyone looking to buy one to google 'camera trait search' and get the lay of the land.The EOS M is a mirrorless interchangeable lens camera with 18 resolution (megapixels). This is Canon's only foray into the 'mirrorless' world. Its focus has been on DSLRs. Probably the most important point for this class of cameras is the sensor size, which is a large APS-C. The only step higher than that is a full-frame 35mm. So this is almost as good as it gets.It does not have a viewfinder, but then it is a compact sized camera, and many in this size category don't have a viewfinder. The ISO rating is 25,600 which makes it work better in low light, although I would not go as high as 25,600. Chromatic aberrations - or, noise as it is called loosely- show long before that. The video is a Full HD- that is 1980x1080 resolution. The camera gives you the option to control manually both the exposure and the focus. It does have an external flash option, but it does not come with a built-in flash. That would be an issue with some users. It comes equipped with WiFi, so you can easily upload photos to your computer and websites. The LCD screen has a 1040,000 resolution- that makes it a very clear screen, and the sustainable burst rate- for fast action- of 4.3 works well. The camera also does RAW processing which would matter if you did not want to be limited by JPEG storage only. And all this with a fairly light camera weighing only 298 grams.Overall, great camera.

I actually shoot with all Nikon gear, but I've used Canon products before. I got this for the low price and size -- which are both great considering the quality this little camera delivers. I wanted to love this camera but my 3 main frustrations were the touchscreen, no on-camera flash, and the lack of viewfinder. I thought I could live with/without these features, but it turns out I couldn't.Dislike:1) Touchscreen: when the camera is on and it's just dangling from your neck, the touchscreen is constantly being \"touched\" by bumping against your body. I have to turn off a lot of the touch functions (especially the shutter) because of this. Even still, the camera tries to focus when I'm walking because it's bouncing against me. Which is odd because you wouldn't think it would respond to a part of your body covered by a t-shirt.. In general I'm not a fan of an all touchscreen camera -- it just seems too impersonal and techy.2) No on-camera flash: It would be so great if this had a small flash on it, even the size of an iPhone flash. I got the camera for family outings, hikes, etc. There were so many times when I was in a dark restaurant and wanted to take a photo of some friends and needed a little fill light.3) Lack of viewfinder: I realize it'd be hard to fit a viewfinder on this camera, so I'm not knocking the camera, per se. But personally I'm so used to using a viewfinder that I just couldn't transition to not having one. If you aren't a pro shooter and are used to taking pictures with your iPhone, a viewfinder might not be as important to you.Like:1) The image quality is impressive for such a small camera. I mostly used it with the 22mm f/2.0 and got some nice results.2) It feels solid -- has just enough weight to it and doesn't feel cheap.3) Price -- the current price makes this an awesome deal for what you get4) Design - slick, simple designIn summary, I just didn't have enough fun shooting with this camera and found myself leaving it at home and bringing my SLR w/ a 35mm 1.4 instead. It's a nice camera, but it just didn't fit my needs and shooting style.

I wanted something small but with good IQ to use while backpacking and to carry daily into town in my book bag.  The fact that it's a Canon was the clinching factor; I have a 7d and know the Canon menus, etc.  I took about 300 photos with this camera and the IQ WAS excellent and I really didn't have major problems with the auto focus (most of what I photograph is not moving, so it is not a big issue.)What is a big issue is the fact that this camera freezes up and is unusable.  This happened the first time on day-one, while writing to my memory card.  I thought this would be a one-off and after I removed the battery and started the camera again all was fine.  Then, 2 days later, it froze while moving between AV and TV modes.  I removed the battery and waited a bit then replaced it and all was fine.  This happened a second time a few days ago (I used the same fix).  When I say it 'froze' I mean the shutter will not fire, the screen is pure white and unresponsive and the Q and other icons do not respond.  This happened again 4 hours ago and the 'normal' fix -- removing the battery, etc. -- is not working.  I'm stuck with the white screen of death.So, I'm returning this to amazon and getting my money back.  I REALLY wanted to like this camera (and did for most of the time I had it!), but I think I may save my pennies (starting with the $345 I spent on this) and buy a Fuji 100s or some other small-ish mirrorless camera in the new year.

The SL1 has better RAW shooting speed and a viewfinder but I really wanted the portability and the 22mm of the EOS M.The feel: I expected this to feel like a flimsy S100 but this is surprisingly solid and heavy. Your fingers are always on the rubber grip parts placed on the camera. The slipperiness of the paint will not affect your grip on the camera whatsoever. If I knew this I would have gotten a red one instead, or maybe a white one.Touch screen: Icons are a little small and screen feels cluttered at times but it is very precise and you won't be hitting any wrong icons. There is a custom menu tab where you can put all your preferred settings. Saves a lot of time from having to search for setting from tab to tab.auto-focus (still subjects): Auto focus is always as sharp as possible with still images. Manually focusing got me the same results and took way longer. The only time I needed manual focus was for night time shots without the focus assist beam (I turned off the red beam to take some stealthy shots).auto-focus (moving subjects): I took some shots from a car and at a amateur MMA event. The image on the screen lags a little as the camera focuses and makes it very difficult to see that exact moment of what you are shooting. This is where a viewfinder would come in handy, no lag at least until the shutter goes off.Flash compatibility: The EOS M should be compatible with any flash that can be attached to the larger Canons. My EOS M works fine with my Yongnuo 467 TTL.Con 1- Short battery life: I'm using 2 aftermarket batteries that hold about 30% more charge than the stock Canon battery. Life is still around 2 to 3 hours. Battery will go from fully charged to half charged in a predictable amount of time. It seems to go from half charged to nearly empty almost randomly. I was reviewing images twice and within 5 minutes, the battery went from half to nearly empty (flashing battery icon) and then died. Once you get to half charge, good luck telling how much battery life you have left.Con 2- Image size: To me, 18mp is kind of large and takes up too much space. Unfortunately the only RAW file size is 18mp. JPEG can be 18mp or 8mp but I would have really liked a 10mp option since that is what I was used to on my Canon XS.Con 3- RAW buffer: I use continuous shooting and will hit 6 RAW images real quick. Once I hit the 6 images, the camera stops to write all the images to the card before you can resume shooting. The SL1 simply slows down to about half the rate of shooting. This pause can be frustrating but I simply shoot more slowly and choose shots more carefully. I have yet to try a UHS-1 memory card and I imagine that will speed things up a bit.Con 4- Slow image review: Sometimes after shooting in continuous mode I will press the review button and try to quickly scroll through images but the camera will just freeze on an image for a couple seconds before letting me slide to the next image.

The only downside is that it is getting old and it does not take great picture in low light conditions compared to other DSLR, even the non-full-frame ones. Since I take a lot of food photos when I go out to fine dining restaurants, I wanted a camera that can take great pictures in low light conditions.I did a quick photo test and this little camera did so much better than my 5D. I was just stunned with the results. Apparently, since I just received this camera, I'm still learning to use it, but so far, I am really happy with the touch screen control.The metal body feels really sturdy and well-built.

An electronic view finder screen is absolutely necessary to get a glare free look-see in sharp focus without having to stretch your arms out in front of you.If you are looking for a camera that will accept your EF lenses and shoot great stills and movies consider an X4i for less money. An X4i will not give you a view finder when the mirror comes up for video but at least it doesn't \"force\" you to use the LCD screen for all stills.I think Canon will soon have a mirrorless DSLR with an electronic view finder that is EOS priced.

It's offer so much in a small package yes , but it has little grip ( when you travel , you may use one hand to take photo a lot due to drinking/smoking/eating/holding some plastic bags ) & short battery life.5) It's hard to adjust ISO / Exposure at a bright sunlight due to no view finder , especially shooting at direct sunlight.6) Slow AF is so frustrating to shoot moving people ( simply just walking toward my direction )7) Touch Shutter - end up I disable it all the time , when my body touched the screen , it shoot a picture ( either you make sure it's turned of / turn the touch shutter off when you are not using )8) It's get hot easily ( erm... just don't feel great , not really a disadvantages )9) EOS Utility - you can't control the camera from a computer. no ports for timelapse & can't control from computer.10) Price Tag = A DSLR and pointless11) Mount / Adapter , the camera has little grip so you will holding the lens to shoot a photo / video.12) Flash - not bad very tiny little flash13) End up in store room very soon due to brought a proper DSLR very soon.The Good1) Small Size + 650d quality2) Video mode - the focus working OK well just slow.Overall - SMALL SIZE + handicapped 650dThis camera is for who ?

I decided to keep trying through Canon in Brazil and, after some trouble, a lot of e-mail exchanging and 2 months of waiting they have exchanged my camera.The new camera works great, it's a well built product, very resistant and has amazing image quality. It fits well my purpose of a second body which can be taken everywhere. My new rating is 4 stars since focus is a serious issue on the camera as it comes out of the box.

Indeed, autofocus is much quicker and it just as good as my 5 year old Panasonic ZS1, which is unacceptable, and my iPhone gets better picture than this camera.  On my iPhone, I use my index fingers to press the capture bottom to take many shots of the same object to pick & choose from later on.  Twenty percent of the pictures were blurry, but some pictures were quite sharp.  2.3x faster autofocus from slow is not good enough for me.When installing the firmware update, Canon does a very poor job on giving instructions.

Click on it, and several PDF instructions will pop up.Original Subject Line: Bought this, but I wish I didn'tCanon EOS M w/ 22mm lens.I have spent countless hours looking for a small mirrorless camera with prime lens for around $500, Panasonic GX1 w/ 20mm lens, Olympus E-PL3 w/ 17mm lens, Sony NEX-5R w/ Sigma 19mm lens, and finally this Canon EOS M w/ 22mm lens.  I thought it was a bargain at $369 for the camera w/ the 22mm lens, but I was so wrong.I look over 100 continuous pictures of my son and not one picture was acceptable.  All the pictures were blurry and the color was weird, especially the reddish color from the lips and cheeks.  I don't like the 22mm lens since I had to stand quite far to capture the whole person.  16mm lens are probably best for taking pictures of people, 20mm lens are acceptable, or go with 25mm lens.I did like the Panasonic GX1 w/ the 20mm lens, but I didn't like the total price tag.  I like the Sony NEX-5R camera, but I didn't like the Sigma lens.  I might have to settle for the Sony NEX-3N.  I feel the Canon EOS M is a beta version and definitely not consumer ready.

Even the pictures look ridiculous. A 5-7 pound EF-S lens on a little mirrorless body is silly, like the Grinch strapping antlers on his little dog. The fact that this camera doesn't perform as well as $400 DSLR just adds to the silliness.Really, if you want to be part of the mirrorless revolution, Olympus and Panasonic are it right now. The best Micro-four-thirds cameras give you image quality that is often better, sometimes far better, than Canon and Nikon crop sensor DSLRs, with a great selection of lenses. The newest Olys with minimal anti-moire filters are just blowing people away. (We got an OM-D and within 3 months ceased using our Canon gear.)Sony and Samsung too have great technology and will have compelling choices as soon as they fill out their line of lenses. I wish they would just join the m4/3 party already but they both want to go it alone.If you like lugging a DSLR around and you want incredible performance and maximum resolution, then the way to go is the sub-$2,000 full frame cameras from Canon and Nikon -- which are amazing and a great deal. But very few people other than pixel peepers will be able to appreciate the difference.Meanwhile, crop sensor DSLR format is probably not long for this world.
