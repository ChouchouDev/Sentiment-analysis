I am not a pro photographer but I do make software for a living. We make a product called iWatermark for Mac, Win, iPhone/iPad and Android so we quite a bit of experience with cameras. If you are interested our site is available with a search of Google (reviews don't allow links).This is my initial review. To get it out of the way the highlights are 50x zoom, Raw as option, video up to 440 fps (at very small rez). I've tried them all.

I have tried all the other super zoom cameras and this is the winner for me.PS To solve the squabble by two other reviewers the manual zoom is in the usual place by the shutter button on the right top and on the left side middle of the lens. It works well and smoothly with a bit of noise.", "Date": "March 19, 2013"}, {"Title": "Not a DSLR but very, very nice", "Author": "Tooncesmom", "ReviewID": "RCUATJPYRUG1X", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I was thrilled to be able to test and review the Fujufilm FinePix 16 Megapixel SL1000. It replaces a Canon Powershot G2 with 4 megapixels so is a huge step up for me. (And, to be admitted, a big learning curve, even though it's a \"point and shoot\" camera--at least for most of my photography.First of all, do download the online extended manual since the abbreviated one included with the camera is not completely accurate. One example: when charging the battery, the included manual states the charger light turns green. Not so. The orange LED turns off. I emailed Fujifilm Support to learn this tidbit. Also, if you're not familiar with the variety of shooting modes (Auto, Advanced, Scene Position, Motion Panorama, Shutter Priority AE, Aperture Priority AE, Manual and Custom) the included manual provides little detail. The downloadable 127-page extended manual is a necessity. I had mine printed on both sides and spiral bound since I will be referring to it constantly until I learn each procedure.The camera has many of the features of a DSLR, including a fantastic Fujinon 24 to 1200mm 50x zoom lens that is a combination of both spherical and ED lenses. With an aperture rating of f/2.9 - 6.5 (17 elements in 12 groups) you can count on great image quality. I've been shooting flowers in my garden and my jewelry creations using the macro in automatic mode and have been very pleased with the results. Even my hand-held shots are clear and detailed. A lever on the left-hand side controls the zoom and focus is automatic. Fujifilm offers 100x Intelligent Digital Zoom that brightens some of the darkest areas so my indoor shots are suitable for the high-quality images I need for my web page.The FinePix SL1000 comes equipped with a high-resolution electronic view finder that makes it easier to frame subjects (something I did not have with the Canon Powershot).I shoot mostly in JPEG (standard and fine) format but appreciate the ability to shoot in RAW. I'm still trying out the filters and the other shooting modes and will report back when I've fully evaluated these features. Also, I have not tested the HD video aspect.I like the size of the SL1000. Weight isn't a problem, but at just under one and a half pounds, it's a bit heavier than similar cameras due to the lens, and not something you could carry in your purse.The wide-angle LCD screen tilts to provide flexible viewing options for both high and low shooting positions, though for macro I prefer using the LCD screen in the flat position.The pluses far outweigh the negatives. Image noise has been mentioned ISO 100., but it hasn't been a problem for me. The lens cap detaches easily and is suspended by a cord so it won't be lost. Battery life is a problem, especially when using the zoom and/or shooting in automatic mode. Fujufilm's batteries are proprietary, but they are not expensive (under $20). I suggest keeping an extra battery or two on hand if you plan to shoot a lot of pictures. Charge time is under an hour with about 90 minutes for a first-time charge.Everything considered, I give the Fujifilm FinePix SL1000 very high marks. I love this camera.", "Date": "July 18, 2013"}, {"Title": "Fantastic zoom that's great for video. Photos are good for the price point", "Author": "Lon J.

It's practically a telescope!  I have never seen an optical zoom this good in a camera at this price point.  Will it best a 1200mm lens on a DSLR in sharpness or overall image quality?  Of course not.  But this Fujifilm camera won't require a second mortgage either.Photo quality is decent for its class but a little soft when using the zoom. There is very little shutter lag and the camera can fire off a number of shots in rapid succession with the continuous shooting mode. The 16 megapixel resolution gives you some additional flexibility when cropping.But it's video where this thing really shines. Unlike some DSLRs it will continually focus (relatively quickly) while shooting. That's nice.  Even when zoomed to the max images are relatively crisp, but just be sure to use a tripod. I should note that I did have some compatibility issues with Final Cut Pro X and I had to pre-encode the videos prior to ingesting for editing.The coolest thing has to be the high speed video feature.  The fastest mode will record at an amazing 480 frames per second - enough to see the world in an entirely new way.  You won't get much resolution at that frame rate but nevertheless it's still amazing to see something like this packed into an inexpensive camera.", "Date": "June 23, 2013"}, {"Title": "Fabulous Photos - No Math", "Author": "Kimberly Morris", "ReviewID": "RGE68W1RO2S15", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I love taking photographs. My photos have won prizes at the Tennessee Valley Fair. (Whoo-hoo!)  Just once I'd like to say to someone, \"My hobby is nature photography,\" and have that person reply, \"Me, too. I love the intricacies found in a rose.\" But, no. They always reply,\"Me, too. What shutter speed do you find most effective when photographing moving water in partial shade?\" What's up with that? I'm not an engineer. If I wanted to spend an afternoon doing math, I'd balance my checkbook.  I am the artist; the camera is the scientist. My job is to notice how beautifully the shadow of an ancient oak tree falls on the side of an abandoned house. The camera's job is to capture that image digitally, without me having to tell it how. This camera is GREAT at that. Between the scene-recognition auto button and the choose-a-scene button (parties, beach, night scenes), this camera does everything I ask, and beautifully.The zoom is awesome. When I was taking pictures of the abandoned house, I couldn't step on the porch, because it was rotten. Still, I was able to get a close-up of the brass doorknob every bit as good as if I'd gone right up to it. Without a tripod. On an overcast day. It's the perfect camera for the person who's photography skills lie primarily with seeing great pictures. I see the picture; the camera takes the picture. I love this camera.", "Date": "November 24, 2013"}, {"Title": "Massive zoom!", "Author": "CyberNik", "ReviewID": "RU9J269CGKQPY", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "Being skeptical about buying a DSLR (due to the cost mainly) I decided to try out this bridge camera, and I must confess I was more than impressed. The main feature of course is the unbelievable 50x zoom, which is totally stunning, and will help you take photos you could never have imagined. Photo quality is quite good, although noise does make its way into certain iso settings, but it's not that obvious and you can easily correct this by \"playing\" with the settings(or lighting, if possible) . The camera focuses really quickly, though in macro mode if the light is low it may have a bit of a difficulty focusing. You can set the shutter and the aperture, or just switch to auto and let the camera decide what's best for it's shot. Generally, the photos in auto mode are very good, unless you want to tweak the settings for a specific shooting. You also get many creative options, like the toy camera effect and the cross screen, among others, which can give nice creative photos without the need of additional editing. Video quality is simply amazing, and luckily the camera keeps its focus(unlike previous Fujifilm models). There is also the option of raw saving, if you have the need for it. The lcd screen is crystal clear and it can tilt so it makes taking low or high photos a piece of cake.My only complaints:-the proximity sensor on the eyepiece is a bit tricky because it can be triggered by your body or hand and the lcd switches off to the eyepiece, which is kind of annoying ( you can select for the lcd to be always on and render the sensor inactive, which is exactly what I did).-the sound of focusing is apparent in videos ,like in previous Fujifilm's models.-Battery drains quickly especially if using the zoom, so you better have a couple of extra batteries at hand.For its features (especially the 50x zoom) and price, this is definitely a bargain. Due to the small amount of noise at certain iso settings I would give this camera 4 stars, but because of the price it is offered and the features it has, I chose to give it 5. Overall I'm very pleased with it and very happy that I bought it!", "Date": "March 23, 2013"}, {"Title": "Good, but NOT good image quality", "Author": "James P. MccArthy \"FotoDad\"", "ReviewID": "R3CPHEZI1UD4KR", "Overall": "3.0", "Content": "Tried out this camera for a week and returned it. My comparison is to the Canon SX40 and Nikon P510, of which have both been replaced by newer models, but with little difference (same sensors). The Fuji is a camera I wanted to love for it's easy to navigate menu, buttons in the right place for quick access/change, and decent build quality. As a long time photographer, my number one priority is good image quality (IQ). As much as I tried, I could not get this Fuji to give me sharp images. At all focal length, they appear soft..some very soft. I shot in good morning and evening light, a few in bright mid-day sun, and only a few true low light shot indoors with low lighting. Macro is decent, but nothing stellar. When compared to the Canon and Nikon, the Fuji just does not have the sharp, in focus, noise free images. The Canon's and Nikon's images are visibly much better, especially if viewing on a large monitor or flat screen HD tv. One big problem with the Fuji was at full zoom length, the focus (set to center)is almost impossible to lock..it constantly moves in/out of focus..very frustrating. If very good image quality is not your first requirement, then the Fuji is a contender.

The construction and features are user friendly and the quality of the pictures for the money, are second to none. I also own a Nicon D 7000.What I realy like about the Fuji is that is a lot lighter and with features that the camera offers makes it a great camera for travel.If I realy want the best pictures quality wise then I use my Nikon, but like I said for travel and wildlife photografy I don't see any other camera comming even close to this one once again for the price.

SL1000, uses the slightly smaller 1/2.33 sensor (compared to the Fujifilm HS50), yet is still a 24-1200mm 35mm equivalent camera. It also loses 25%-30% of the HS-50's its price as well. No other name-brand camera gets you to the massive 1200mm range for $260 or less, actually $250 as this is written. No one shoots at 1200mm all the time, or even most of the time for that matter. If you want the capability to do so, the SL1000 gets you there the most affordably. It offers a larger, 3 inch 920K dot tilting LCD, a 920K EVF as well: a better treatment than several more expensive cameras in this class. Consider the Sony DSC-HX300/B 20 MP Digital Camera with 50x Optical Image Stabilized Zoom and 3-Inch LCD (Black) (about $400 at the time of this writing) that lacks RAW, and in general isn't as competent a camera, despite its comparatively high price.If the end use is standard prints, the internet, along with 8 x 10s from time to time, you'll be happy. Give it plenty of light, try to shoot at lower ISOs, you'll be more than happy. It is no secret that more pictures are taken every day with cellphones than with any other device. It is also no secret that sales of the smaller point and shoot cameras have plummeted, but long zoom cameras have been in demand. The SL1000 does everything that your smartphone cannot, and that's a good thing.There are a *lot* of choices out there, but not at $250. You can also spend $360 Sony DSC-HX50V/B 20.4MP Digital Camera with 3-Inch LCD Screen (Black) and more on pocket cameras, and more. You can spend a lot more on bridge-class cameras as well. The \"Ultimate Compact Camera,\" according to some, is the Fujifilm X100S 16 MP Digital Camera with 2.8-Inch LCD (Silver). It is about $1300, though, with no optical zoom at all.Just two years ago, no bridge camera with a 1200mm zoom was even available. And, whether we like it or not, two years from now there are going to be several more options that some will call significant. That's why the SL1000 makes sense. Anyone would call it a generally very good camera if you didn't know what brand it was. For $250, though, it is a screamingly good, outstandingly superb camera. It isn't necessarily the best bridge camera, it isn't, but it is the best for the least dollars. If you are willing to spend more, yes . . . the SX-50 Canon, the Fuji FinePix HS50EXR are all quite worthy of your consideration, as are the Fuji X-S1 and the Panasonic FZ-200. For the money, though, at this price point . . . the SL1000 is a lot of bang for the buck.You'll probably want to drop twenty bucks for Pack Of 2 NP-85 Batteries And Charger Kit For FujiFilm FinePix SL240 SL260 SL280 SL300 SL305 SL1000 Digital Camera + More!! and Transcend 16GB Class 10 SDHC Flash Memory Card (TS16GSDHC10E) to get up and running. The 350 shot battery life is good, compared to the Nikon P520's 200 shots for example, but use outdoors in cooler weather nerfs that a bit, and even a small amount of video can run the battery down quickly.It is a far better-featured camera than expected, with the EVF and LCD quickly putting the more expensive Canon SX-50 and Panasonic FZ-70 units both to shame. Scoring 2,773 lines per picture height via Imatest, it is one of the sharpest len arrays ever put on a bridge camera. Nor can most bridge class cameras match the 1080p60 video capability of this economical powerhouse. It should surprise very few that this camera likes a lot of light, and if you are going to spend a lot of time at the 1000mm - 1200mm area, a good tripod is your friend. I won't suggest that this is my favorite wildlife / outdoors camera, the Panasonic Lumix DMC-FZ200 12.1 MP Digital Camera with CMOS Sensor and 24x Optical Zoom - Black is, a far better camera for my purposes with commensurately higher price tag to go along with it.The SL1000 delivers solidly on its intended target: a huge zoom range for not huge dollars.Copyright 2013 by Randy Wakeman & Randy Wakeman Outdoors.

Hentze", "ReviewID": "RF2PONK7K5TVJ", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "The Fujifilm FinePix SL1000 is Fuji's mid-level super zoom bridge camera. The S series is a notch below Fuji's high-end HS series of bridge cameras. Although it lacks some of the settings and features of the HS series, the SL1000 does have some features that are impressive. The main feature is its massive 50X zoom lens. Before I go any further though, I must point out that although this camera looks a little like a DSLR, it is not. It is a bridge camera with the same tiny sensor as you average pocket point and shoot camera. It is just housed in a DSLR style body, with some extra features and a massive zoom lens. Now that we got that out of the way, on to my review. Unboxing the Fuji SL1000, I noticed that it weighs slightly less and is slightly smaller than the Fuji HS50EXR super zoom. It weighs much less than my DSLR. In the box are the usual assortment of accessories. I was disappointed that there is no lens hood. First charge of the battery took about 90 minutes. The proprietary battery is charged in a proprietary external charger. The camera itself has average build quality and is almost entirely plastic. I was disappointed that even the tripod mount is plastic. The camera's ergonomics are very good, and everything is well laid out. No SD card is included, so make sure you have one. A fast \"Class 10\" speed card is recommended. The SL1000 menu system is very simple and easy to figure out. The camera has a variety of shooting modes including full automatic and \"manual\". There are also some built in filter effects which are pretty neat. I was disappointed there were no settings to adjust the camera's Noise Reduction like there is on the HS Series. The SL1000 does have RAW Mode which is a very good thing.I set out on a sunny day, and took over a hundred pictures under various conditions. I used several different modes and settings. I shot mostly in (P)Mode, and auto mode. I used Fine/JPEG Format, not RAW. Refresh time between shots was very fast. I noticed that when shooting in shady conditions, the camera would use an unnecessary high ISO. Sometimes 400 or higher. I turned off Auto-ISO and manually selected ISO 100 or 200 if needed. The 50X zoom lens performed well. It's incredible 24-1200mm range didn't disappoint. The 3\" high resolution screen is very good. It's is clear and bright. It isn't an articulating screen though. It only slightly tilts, which I thought was kind of a weird design. While out, I also took several minutes of video to evaluate later. When I got home, I also shot a few dozen indoor pictures for testing purposes. I shot most of them in simple auto mode to see how the camera would handle low light without any help. After shooting 100+ pictures and several minutes of video, my battery still shows as full which tells me battery life is very good.When I finished my testing, I hooked the camera up to my PC and HD Monitor using the included USB cable. Thankfully, the cable is standard and not proprietary. Once downloaded, my results generally very good. Almost all my outdoor pictures came out excellent no matter what mode I used. Details were great. Colors were accurate. I didn't notice any optical aberrations, etc. The Fuji's Image Stabilization generally did a great job, but a steady hand is needed at the high end of the zoom.  The overall results were almost as good as my higher end HS50EXR, but not quite. I did notice a little image noise, especially when the camera went above 100 ISO. My indoor results were good too. Image noise wasn't bad up until ISO 400, and still acceptable at ISO 800. I have no doubt that with a little tweaking of the camera's settings, my results could be even better. My HD test video came out excellent too. It did not disappoint on my HD monitor.The Fujifilm FinePix SL1000 is not a DSLR, and it isn't perfect. It is a very good point and shoot camera with an incredible lens though. With a little trial and error, it produces very good results outdoors, and good results indoors as long as you keep the ISO as low as possible. I recommend it.Pros:Incredible 50x Wide Angle Zoom Lens.Electronic Viewfinder.Hot shoe.Good automatic modes.Manual controls.RAW Mode.Generally very good image quality indoors and out.Very good 1080i HD video quality.Fast focusing and refresh time between shots.Very good battery life.Good value.Cons:Average build quailty.Tiny 1/2.3-inch CMOS Image Sensor.Image noise noticeable above ISO 100.No noise reduction settings.No lens hood and mediocre accessories.Proprietary battery.", "Date": "June 24, 2013"}, {"Title": "SLR features without SLR hassle and cost", "Author": "W.

The main benefit I see of this camera is that it provides many features of a SLR, but without the associated costs and hassles.I loved using my Cannon SLR.  Though due to its cost and having to drag around all the associated lenses, I rarely take it with me when I go somewhere I may want to take photos.  I seem to always take a small pocket camera with me now, as they have increased in performance massively over the past couple years.  The drawback to the  pocket cameras is that there is no hotshoe, the lenses dont zoom enough, or they just dont have the features I like about the SLR's.  This camera is the answer to that.  There are no lenses to change or drag around, yet you get excellent wide angle and zoom capability beyond what I have seen in any pocket camera.  There is a hotshoe in case you want to use a quality external flash, as the built in flash on pocket cameras are usually lacking.  In short, this is the perfect 'missing link' between a SLR and a pocket camera.The zoon is excellent, as is the wide angle setting.  With the image stabilizing, it takes quality photos even at higher zoom rates.  You will still need a rest or tripod for ultrazoom photos to be at their best though.Battery life seems to be typical of most cameras, nothing to exclaim or complain about there.  The weight is nice, enough to be stable in your hand but not enough to make your wrist or elbow tire if shooting for a long session.  The overall build quality seems good.If you are like me and prefer using SLR type camers, but dont want to risk taking an expensive SLR with you certain places, or dont want to invest in thousands of dollars worth of lenses, but dont want to revert to using a pocket camera for everything, this is a great option.", "Date": "July 24, 2013"}, {"Title": "Advanced features that are easy to use", "Author": "Juniorverse1", "ReviewID": "RZK3B3E75S4MC", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I'm enjoying how easy it is to take great photos with this camera.  Advanced users will be attracted to full shutter and aperture control.  More casual users will love the auto-scene analyzer and the fun special effects.Moving the mode dial to SR AUTO selects the auto-scene selector, which automatically detects the scene type and applies the optimal settings for the scene.  Examples include night landscapes and night portraits, backlit portraits, and daytime landscapes.  This camera does a good job of automatically detecting the scene and the resulting photos look great.The camera includes advanced filter effects that replaces the need for post-processing on your computer.  Effects include \"toy camera\", \"miniature\" that applies a tilt-shift effect, \"pop color\", \"high-key\", \"soft focus\", \"cross screen\" that creates star-like lines that radiate out from bright objects, and \"partial color\" effects that take black and white photos but keep a certain color, like blue or yellow, in its original form.  There are other post-processing tools like red eye reduction, cropping, and photo rotating.There are plenty of other presets that you would expect a point-and-shoot camera to have, like sport mode, night mode, fireworks, snow, flower close-ups, and more.  You can also take panoramic photos.  You can shoot movies in 1080i resolution.  The movies looks great, and there are easy editing functions for trimming or joining movies.The camera is not as small as many point-and-shoots, but it feels nice in your hands and the controls are well-placed.  Menus are easy to navigate and the camera does a great job of explaining the selected mode and how it operates.The lens extends significantly as you use the very powerful zoom.  When you zoom in very far, the camera still takes nice photos with the help of image stabilization.  The screen is bright and relatively easy to see in bright light.  There is also a digital display showing the typical camera settings as you look through the viewfinder.I definitely recommend this camera for anyone looking for a high-quality camera that is easy to use but also gives you plenty of control.", "Date": "July 7, 2013"}, {"Title": "Better than the canon sx 50", "Author": "Jimmy", "ReviewID": "R1CMX02YPCTNQA", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I'm not a professional photographer but I am writing a review to tell you why I like the fujifilm sl 1000 better than the canon sx 50. They both have great 50x zoom but the fujifilm has more features. When using the canon it was weird not having features I was so used to having on my fujifilm. For example the canon lacks any kind of slow motion filming mode. The fujifilm has two different slow motion filming modes. The fujifilm screen is larger and much clearer. Also the veiwfinder is a lot clearer than the canon. The rubberized grip around the lens of the fujifilm makes it easier to hold and allows you to actually grip the lens like a DSLR.

I hate paying ridiculous prices for school photos and to have our pictures taken in a studio. I wanted a camera that takes good quality pictures with out having to pay a ridiculous price for a professional camera. Especially since I don't really know what I am doing. I also wanted to pick up photography as a hobby. My sweetheart bought me this as a birthday present. I have yet to try any of the manual setting and have just been messing around with the camera in its factory preset mode. Now that I am a little more comfortable with it I am going to print the user manual for it.For now however I am very pleased with it!! The camera has taken really good shots of my kids on the trampoline and other action shots. They come out clear and beautiful. I have taken some pictures of my kids having them do poses in the yard all dressed up and in different natural lighting and the camera continues to impress me.I have uploaded some of the pictures I took using different zoom settings and different lighting. The spider one is taken in very low lighting with the stock flash. As you can see there is awesome detail. The dandelion is crystal clear and show in great detail. And the eagle is several mile away and the camera is fully zoomed and you can see the details in the wings. Again I am a point and shoot kind of person and when you talk ISO and Macro you might as well be speaking Greek. What I do know is that for an Amateur this camera is awesome!

I would like to make it clear that I am not a pro in photography, so those who expect an expert review may skip reading mine. I bought before this one Nikon COOLPIX S9200 16 MP CMOS Digital Camera with 18x Zoom NIKKOR ED Glass Lens and Full HD 1080p Video (Black) and had to return it since it was making blurry pictures and could not lock focus, also: when zoom used , the focus was missing at all. This Fuji camera is big (but light) and not so easy to carry everywhere or put it in your purse, but it is definitely worth carrying it. The pictures are crystal clear even when you use just automatic settings, or at night time(night pictures are a big issue with almost all cameras, but not with this - there are modes for beautiful night landscapes) . It is easy to lock a focus, also you don't need sturdy hand - quite shatterproof.(Make sure to hold the zooming lens underneath for extra support - check some youtube videos from fuji for instructions). The 50x zoom is amazing - you can use it as a binoculars and see exotic bird in the sky :). The close up photos of a flower or leaf are so crystal and detailed - beautiful. The 360 panoramic pictures - also! The videos - perfect.CONS: Many people complain that the lens cap has to be removed manually - for me this is a minor inconvenience (this is a huge lens and closing and opening automatically requests a lot of power).Also: the battery doesn't last a long time, but it is not expensive, I would buy a spare one to carry in the camera bag.I still have not tried all the modes and possibilities of this amazing camera.

Jensen \"snake man\"", "ReviewID": "R28L8K2OQ38OY1", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "After the whole world had gone digital (except for me), I finally sold my extensive Olympus collection, consisting of 3 bodies and an arsenal of lenses, said goodbye to film, and bought my first digital camera - a Fuji SL7000. With a whopping 6-megapixel processor (pretty standard for the time), I used it to photograph my sister's wedding. The results were impressive. In 2008 I bought an Olympus UZ-570 (10-megapixels and a 20x zoom) for a trip to Africa, and I used that camera for six years until last month when I bought the Fuji SL1000.What can I say? The SL1000 packs a wallop in the zoom lens department! At 2 1/2 times the power of my Olympus \"ultra zoom,\" the 50x zoom on the Fuji is a 1200mm equivalent in a DSLR system, eliminating a lot of weight to lug around and a lot of time and money saved by not having to buy expensive lenses and change them constantly. I did not want to return to the days of a 40-pound camera bag. The SL1000 and everything else I need fits neatly into a holster style case that I can wear on my hip.Photo quality is excellent, even at full zoom, with the camera compensating for shake. Video quality is equally good, and the stereo sound recording is amazing! The menu is intuitive, modes are logical and allow for a great deal of creativity whether you are a pro photographer or a newbie. I photograph snakes and other reptiles, and the SL1000's macro ability is phenomenal.I was disappointed that the SL1000 (and most of the new Fuji lineup) doesn't have a manual focus option. When I was in Africa, there were times when a lion was in tall grass and my Olympus would automatically focus on the grass, giving me a blurry lion. This was easily corrected by switching to manual focus mode. This is not possible with the Fuji, and could be problematic for anyone who spends time at the zoo photographing through glass, chain link, bars, etc., or who just prefers to be in total control by being able to focus on their own.Best features besides the lens include a hot shoe, an adjustable diopter (for folks who find it awkward to wear glasses while looking through a viewfinder), an adjustable screen for up and down (but not sideways) viewing, dual zoom controls, and a neat assortment of special effects, all packed into a solid, lightweight, compact camera.One of my main criteria for choosing digital cameras in the past was the ability to use AA batteries which are inexpensive and available everywhere. Battery type was the main reason for choosing the SL7000 and the UZ570. I compromised with this camera because I wanted the zoom, and I wish the technicians at Fuji would try to be more consistent in making all of their cameras AA compatible. Right now it's about half and half. (Are you listening, Fuji?) Proprietary batteries are a pain in the butt! They are expensive, require a charger, and are difficult to charge away from home, especially in foreign countries.Overall, this is an excellent camera choice for anyone who wants a simple-to-use camera that yields excellent results.", "Date": "February 2, 2014"}, {"Title": "Great family camera", "Author": "Kat", "ReviewID": "RKMBKVXYPA9M", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "Since I loved my Fuji Finepix E550 that finally died this year after almost 8 years of service, I knew I would go back to Fuji for my next camera. My husband has always wanted a great zoom for when we go hiking so that was first on our list of must haves for the new camera. After much deliberation, research, and discussion, we decided to go with the SL1000. And after a week, I am so glad we did. This camera is great for a family with young children who don't stop moving!Our previous camera was blurry inside and during playtime outside but this one is fabulous! The many modes are great for all the different situations you find yourself in with kids. Pictures that were once blurry in the living room at night are now clear and well lit. Running pictures are clear. To be honest, it did take a couple of days of playing with different settings to determine what mode is best for what but I think that is true for any camera. The zoom is great! The stabilization works very well. The filters are fun and give you some room to be artistic if you so choose. The high speed video is a lot of fun. My six year old finds it entertaining to make slow motion videos of toys falling. The HD video itself is wonderful and a lot better than the previous camera.I would recommend buying more batteries. The one that comes with it does last quite a while and it charges in about 2 hours but it is well worth it to have extras. Also, the strap that comes with it is not comfortable around the neck. Kind of scratchy. I would recommend getting something different.Updated 11/24/13: This camera has now gone a trip with us to Colorado and some serious hiking. The pictures were fantastic and the video is equally as great. The zoom was so great out there that we got many pictures we would have never gotten without it.

But the price difference between my Sony and this Fujifilm is about $150 which makes the Fujifilm more affordable for people looking for an all in one camera.Pros:*Very easy to navigate on screen- able to change how you take pictures and speeds*Gives you almost all the functions of SLR in one complete camera without having to worry about changing lenses.*Has very quick focus and super fast shutter speeds. I shot some pics of the boys playing basketball and this camera is great at capturing them mid-air or at other times when they are running back and forth. A common problem with Non-DSLR cameras is that they can't capture objects moving fast enough or they do but them come in really blurry. With my Sony, I am able to capture people in mid-air but when they are running back and forth it can become a challenge to get a clear picture. I say with my Sony 1 in 4 will be perfectly clear but with this Fujifilm 3 in 4 come in clear.*Super zoom function with clear focus- My Sony can only do 30x zoom while this Fujifilm can do 50x!*Easy to grab photos from camera to import into your computerCons:*For a non-DSLR this camera is a bit heavy and bulky. When I compare the weight and size with my Sony this camera is both bigger and heavier. For a person looking for a camera without having to change lenses the weight and size shouldn't be an issue. But for others who are looking for a slimmer non-DSLR camera that they can throw into a backpack and not worry about extra weight, this camera is not the right one for you.*Doesn't have high quality low light/night shot ability. My main factor in purchasing my Sony was how frustrating my old point and shoot would take museum pics and night shots. Even though this Fujifilm says it works well for low light/night shots I am personally not impressed by it. If one of your main buying reasons for this camera is low light shots (such as museums,concerts, and late night parties)I have to tell you to look somewhere else. The pictures still come in very dark and blurry if your object is in motion. Now if I where to take the same pics with my Sony... as my hubby says \"Hey look your camera just made these night pics into day pics!\"Overall for the price and what this camera can do I think it's a great value(unless you wanted a camera for low light and night shots) and has everything all in one camera. The zoom function is amazing and even though my Sony can go up to 30x.. with 50x the zoom I can just imagine all the shots I could have taken of Our Lady Liberty while I was on the Staten Island Ferry. And trust me my Sony got some AMAZING shots of her! So instead of buying a true DSLR that can cost you over $1,000 and you will have to carry multiple lenses, I suggest paying 1/4 the cost and investing in this Fujifilm.

It worked great. Easy to use if you've had an SLR camera before. The telephoto lens did a great job at it's max setting while being held by hand. Haven't had a chance to check out other features, yet.Followup review...I purchased this camera roughly 6 months ago because it had so many great reviews, and at first, I thought it worked very well. I bought it for ease of use, however I'm starting to be a little disappointed.1.  If I didn't use the camera for a couple of weeks, it would not turn on. I thought it was the battery, so I charged it (but thought this was funny because the battery should last a little longer without being used). It didn't take long to charge which was unusual, but it seemed to work fine after that. I would just have to remember to check the charge a day before I planned on using it, but was worried that when one of those special pictures came up that it wouldn't work. AND, this is just what happened. Only this time, when the camera wouldn't turn on, I pulled the battery out and put it back in and it worked and showed fully charged. I've charged the battery several times now. I just went to see if it would turn on and it wouldn't. I put it in the charger and it wouldn't charge. I'm assuming a bad battery (it should have lasted longer than this).2.  Preview button. I pressed the Preview Button to look at some of my pictures, but at times it would say that the picture was corrupted, so I lost the picture. It would almost freeze searching for the picture. Not sure if that was the card or not, but shouldn't have been.3. This Christmas I used the camera at our family Christmas. Many pictures turned out blurry when a subject barely moved. It's always taken descent pictures in low light, but not that night. I had to turn the flash on to get better pictures, but the lighting was adequate for clear pictures. Sometimes it works right, sometimes it doesn't.I'm a little disappointed that I have to spend so much time trying to get this camera to do what I want it to do and I am no novice when it comes to cameras.

No one had the SL 1000 in stock so I looked at the S8200 from Fuji for comparison purposes.  Why the SL1000?  First of all the battery is rechargeable, has a viewfinder along with the LCD screen that tilts, has a 50X optical and 100X digital zoom and can shoot in Raw not that I will use it much..  The SL 1000 is so close to price of the S8200 and  S8400 why settle for less. The closest Nikon and Canon cameras with viewfinders were at least $100 dollars more. I was  concerned about picture quality but I was convinced on Amazon by the reviews by the semi pro photographers to buy this camera as all of those reviews were positive and had 4 or 5 stars under photo quality. Although I have only had the camera for two days I know I made the right choice.  I took the camera to the ocean (15 degrees below zero wind chill factor) and got some great pictures.  I have taken both good and bad pictures but the  bad ones were my fault. I have experimented with the different settings and shooting modes and still have much to learn. I have the camera picture quality set to Fine and 4.3. The memory card will hold less pictures but the quality is higher with better resolution. I am using a High Performance SDHC Pixtor  SanDisk Class10 Memory Card. I have taken some  good pictures on auto mode but got even better results with experimenting with the different settings. If you want to take time to really learn how to use this camera it is IMHO the best camera with the  most features at the best price. A friend of mine who is a semi pro photographer stopped by the house today and saw the  camera.  She picked  the camera up and was surprised at how little it weighed and used the 50X  optical zoom and said \"that is Sick\", I guess that means she was impressed. There are simpler cameras out there and the SL 1000 can be used on the auto modes to get good pictures but if you want to learn more about photography and become a better photographer this is the camera to buy unless of course you want  full DSLR and many lenses.  At $249 on Amazon I felt I could not go wrong and at that price I bought the 4 year protection plan at  $42.00 which includes accidental damage with some exceptions.  The price for the camera and protection plan is less than most cameras in this class at most stores.  I am looking forward to learning how to get the best results from my camera and am very happy with my purchase. I hope this review is helpful to some of you.

Comparison to S4500,  choose cost based on your photography needs.", "Author": "Two kids mom \"scienceteachermom\"", "ReviewID": "RFD3FTLUXK3R9", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "We already owned a FinePIX S4500 and I will compare the SL1000 to this camera.  Currently the S4500 is about half the price of the SL1000. We love both of them, but the comparison below may help you make a choice between the cost/benefits for both cameras.These cameras are excellent choices for those who want more than a little point and shoot but less than a full fledge SLR.  They both offer the ability for the total photo novice to take excellent photos and as you learn more for you to take more control over the shots.  The size and weight are much lower than an SLR and the options much greater than a point and shoot.  If you are going to be taking photos of birthday parties, soccer games and vacation photos the lower end S4500 will serve you quite well, you can even move up to more complex photography by taking over some of the control from the camera as you learn.  If you want to move up to images you can really edit, higher optical zoom,  (want to be able to do extreme close ups) ,the ability to have different outputs,  to be able to add a fancier flash (perhaps use one you already have for an SLR) or video extreme close ups then you should chose the higher end SL1000.  You do need to manage battery use more with the SL1000, since it uses a rechargeable battery rather than standard AA.  For a more detailed comparison and more information continue reading.Weight and Size: The S4500 weighs about 19 oz (540g) with the AA batteries and the memory card) and the SL1000 about 23 oz (650g).  This would not seem like a lot, but held in your hand it does make the difference.  The longer optical zoom (50X on the SL1000 vs 30X on the S4500) means that the SL1000 is front heavy and it does feel heavier when you are holding it.  It is also physically larger although not a huge amount.  Carrying it in the case makes little difference.Image:The S4500 is 14 pixals while the SL1000 is 16.2.  When printing your average photos you will probably not notice the difference, we cannot tell which photos were from which camera.The S4500 has a focal Length of 24-720mm and the SL1000 from 24 to 1200mm (this is a big difference, you can take photos from MUCH farther away with the SL1000).  Full aperture is F3.1 (wide) to F5.9 (telephoto) on the S4500  and F2.9-6.5 on the SL1000.  The SL1000 can go up to the equivalent of ISO 12800 while the S4500 goes up to 6400, another big difference, meaning that the SL1000 can handle lower light levels.  Fuji is a leader here,  they get lower noise in high ISO shots without blurring detail (algorithms will decrease the image detail in some other camera brands).  There is some argument about how film ISO translates to digital ISO, but for comparison purposes across the same brand the SL1000 is much better here.JPEG  (Stills) and AVI (movies) are the only file outputs on the S4500 while the SL1000 can do JPEG, RAW (RAF format) and even MPO (Which is 3D) as well,  the movie output is in MOV form not AVI.The S4500 actually has more shooting modes (Zoom Bracketing, Natural Light, Natural Light & with Flash, Portrait, Baby, Smile, Landscape, Sport, Night, Night (Tripod), Fireworks, Sunset, Snow, Beach, Party, Flower, Text) than the SL100 which has (Portrait, Landscape, Sport, Night, Night (Tripod), Fireworks, Sunset, Snow, Beach, Party, Flower, Text).  They both have a Panorama mode as well.  The modes are actually pretty amazing, point the camera at a person and it knows the difference between that and a flower.The zoom on the S4500 is at the front while the SL1000 has both front zoom and a button on the side of the lens for zooming.  There is NO manual zoom on either, which those who previously use SLRs will find annoying.Both have a build in flash, but the SL1000 has a shoe (a place you can put a fancier flash, like for an SLR)Both have SR AUTO, Instant zoom, Face Detection, Auto red-eye removal, Framing guideline, blink detection, Frame No. memory, Histogram display, motion panorama, Face recognition, Date stamp and the SL1000 adds an advanced mode, zoom bracketing and a framing guideline.  The blink detection can be amusing, we have been told that the camera detected a blink in a tree....Video:The S4500 video quality is lower,  1280X270 (mono sound)  vs 1920X1080 (stereo sound).  This is noticeable when playing back on a TV both in image and sound quality.  However, the lower quality is perfectly acceptable, better than my Flip video and in both cameras you CAN use the optical zoom when recording video on both cameras which is really neat.Power:The S4500 uses AA batteries, and I would suggest the lithium ones.  In fact, with the lithium batteries the S4500 takes noticeably more photos that the SL1000 with its rechargeable NP85.  You need to buy another NP85 (two are less than 20 bucks on Amazon currently) so you can charge one while using the other.  The fact that you can buy AA anywhere makes the S4500 more versatile here.LCD:The LCD on the SL100 can fold out, should you want to hold the camera at a weird angle to take a photo and still see what you are doing.  This is nice, but adds to the cost.Summary:Either of these camera is an excellent choice taking your general photographs to another level beyond point and shoot but without the expense and weight of an SLR.  If you want to really get into photography or higher quality video is important to you, choose the higher end camera.  If you are not sure, you just want to take great photos without much effort,  go for the lower end,  you can still have some control as you learn to take better photos and if you decide later you need something fancier, cameras will have probably improved even more in the meanwhile.", "Date": "July 1, 2013"}, {"Title": "Better than my sx40 canon", "Author": "Wen \"wmrss\"", "ReviewID": "R21Z4F0N01WRXT", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I usually don't write reviews, but decided this is worth writing.

They stand their policies without B.S. !I have 2 older SLR units (film) but it is getting so difficult to use these anymore, and costly.  Electronics has indeed taken over and for the better as a general note.  The 50X OPTICAL zoom is just right for most situations and very easy and FAST to shoot with so you don't miss the action.  This however is NOT a $1200 camera like some have tried to state or compare. It is however one of the best for those that want an upgraded unit, easy to use/understand, and doesn't set you back a house and car payment! Ha!  I believe you will enjoy this unit at many different levels and has many cool extra features that are always a plus to use.  The number one reason, out of many I purchased this is for FAST on the go shots that I could zoom in quickly and not have to deal with changing lens types...  what a pain when you just don't have the time or want to carry the big bags.  That's why some professionals have two or three cameras around their neck - FAST SHOOTING.

I have already used the tilt back screen to shoot shots in crowds as I am not real tall, and got the shots of \"Santa\" in arriving.  Happy picture taking!ps...  Do Not go cheap on the memory card!  This camera is a high-end fast shooting and must have a very fast grade card.  Most brands are fine as long as they are coded \"HCI or (10) speed.

I took the camera with me on a short trip to Africa. We did a lion safari tour, and I was able to easily zoom in on the faces of the lions and tigers without difficulty.

I rarely take the camera out of the AUTO mode and have found the photos to be very good.I can use an HDMI cable to connect the camera to my HDTV to see the photos: they really look great on the large screen.You can use the large viewscreen on the back of the camera, or the viewfinder. Most cameras do not offer this option. I have found the viewfinder to be very helpful when shooting on an extremely sunny day. You can set the camera so that it will sense if you are using the viewfinder: when it senses you are  it will turn off the LCD screen, helping to save battery power. When you are done with the viewfinder it turns that off and turns the screen back on.The LCD screen tilts up and down.

I adjusted the screen so that I could still see the shot and was able to get some good photos.It does a wonderful job, in AUTO mode, of setting depth of field. The item at the center of shot is in focus, the background is not, helping to highlight the item I am shooting. I prefer that to a photo where everything is clear.I have not used the movie option, so I cannot comment.I bought some extra batteries on Amazon and carry them with me, but have never gotten to the point of needing to replace the battery in the middle of the day.The MACRO setting is phenomenal. There are two settings, regular macro and super macro. I took some shots of some old coins - I had the camera so close that I was almost touching them. The camera was able to automatically focus, even at such a close distance, and gave me incredibly sharp photos of the coins.It has a popup flash - I've only used it a few times, it has helped a lot.Overall, I am most impressed by the amazing clarity and sharpness of the photos I have taken with this camera.ConsIt sometimes has a problem focusing in a very dimly lit area. In this case a manual focus would be a big help but it does not have one. If I took a lot of photos in dimly lit areas, this might be a big problem. However, it has rarely come up.The zoom is auto, you zoom in and out by pushing buttons. I'd like a manual control.OverallAs I said, I LOVE this camera. I have been able to take shot that I never would have imagined with any other camera. The zoom is incredible, the photos are amazingly sharp, and the camera is comfortable to hold and use.

High speed performance is afforded throughout the system, enabling fast continuous shooting up to 10 full resolution frames per second and an auto focusing speed of 0.2 second. Full HD 1080i video capabilities are also supported at a frame rate of 60fps. An incredibly long 50x optical zoom lens is also built into the SL1000's design, giving a 35mm-equivalent focal length range of 24-1200mm. This range can be effectively doubled through the use of Intelligent Digital Zoom, and an optical image stabilization system benefits shooting at such magnifications by reducing the appearance of camera shake.

It seems to take good pictures. It has a ton of buttons that I will probably never use. The main reason I got it was for the zoom and the shutter speed and continuous pics. I can push a button, make 1 more selection then with the press of the shutter button, take many many pics at the same time. So its easy to get lots of shots as something moves and get just the right pic. I love this.My last camera was sooo slow, that I would press the button to take a pic, but by the time the shutter actually closed to take a pic, the subject had already moved. It was terrible.The thing that is driving me nuts though is that I cant get the pics out of the camera. With other cameras. I could just plug the USB into a computer, windows would pop up something asking to import the pics and that was it. Sure Easy.With this, I plugged the USB cable into a Mac and then a PC. Nothing. I even tried loading their software into both the Mac and the PC. Still nothing. I searched the manual, but found nothing. At this point, Im thinking that the camera is defective. Surely the manufacturer would not make it this hard to do something this simple.The pics are all stored, I hope, on the card I bought.

Super slow-motion filming. Manual controls. Hot shoe, which lets you attach external flashes.The zoom is amazing, if sometimes iffy indoors - it sometimes had trouble focusing on objects within a room. Outdoors, much better, although you may still get some blur at max zoom. Using the zoom a lot will use up the battery more, though.RAW is there if you want to play around with it, but for non-DSLR owners, it's probably going to be unused, unless you want to get familiar with RAW editing.The multiple-pic modes are useful, but not easy to get to - you have to switch modes and pick the one you want unless it's already assigned. You could use the one Fn button for something (ISO, image size/quality, white balance, etc.), but it may not have the function you want.The viewfinder lets you hold the camera steadier. It has a sensor turns the LCD on and off when you use it. However, you may find yourself triggering it by mistake.The screen tilts up and down only, to a limited degree, although still useful.Slow-mo uses a smaller screen size, understandably.

Swope", "ReviewID": "R12F64SBNOZ1GK", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "I have really been enjoying using the Fujifilm SL1000, and am overall very impressed with its flexibility, number of features, and most importantly, image quality.  Some months back I was shopping for a DSLR for my daughter's birthday.  As I reviewed the options I became more aware of how many improvements had been introduced since I last upgraded my camera.  Suddenly I found myself shopping for 2 cameras.  Hers was actually the easier, as she is a fairly accomplished photographer, knows what she wants and needs and has a lot of lenses from a certain company.  For myself, the decision was a lot more difficult as I wanted fine image quality (primarily for shooting art glass) and a good zoom for my son's band performances, high sensitivity for night photos, and to eliminate the need for flash in the glass photos.  In other words, I was looking for a good all-around camera, without breaking the bank.  After reading dozens, maybe even hundreds of reviews, I decided that a bridge camera would be a good choice but found it a challenge to balance quality, features and my price point.  For the past 10 years or so I have been using Panasonic Lumix cameras and have been very happy with the quality (both build and image) as well as the flexibility (long zoom, small package).  To be truthful, it was the introduction of their FZ200 which made me feel like my old camera was sorely lacking.  I set the FZ200 and it's cousin the Leica V-Lux as the \"holy grail\" attempting to match features and quality within my price bracket (no easy task).  Reviewing the options, several popular cameras which shared most of the features were in my range,but I really wasn't satisfied with image quality.  I ultimately purchased an Olympus Pen micro 2/3 for the image quality and the ability to use my old Minolta lenses.  That, however, was a fairly big disappointment (if interested, that review is here http://www.amazon.com/Olympus-Thirds-Interchangeable-Digital-14-42mm/product-reviews/B004L9IXWI/ref=cm_cr_dp_synop?ie=UTF8&showViewpoints;=0&sortBy;=bySubmissionDateDescending#R2YXXZAS08PQNH ). Back to the hunt.  I considered the Fujifilm FinePix HS50EXR 16 MP Digital Camera with 3-Inch LCD (Black) but nixed it because of the manual zoom.  To cut to the chase, the SL1000 builds on the features of the HS50 adding a 50x zoom lens and very bright optics (F2.9-5.6), very nice in a lens this size, achieving ISO sensitivity to 12800. It has a CMOS sensor and optical image stabilization, which produces a  nice image quality, even at maximum zoom (see sample photos).  The articulating screen and electronic viewfinder (a rarity in bridge cameras in this range) providing excellent options for composing shots in a variety of lighting conditions.  Both start-up and recovery are fast, so I do not have to worry about losing shots as I did with the Pen...which brings me to another favorite feature which I did not initially consider: moving object tracking.  Since I did not get this with sports photography in mind, and my kids are at an age where I can get them to stay still, it was not a high priority, BUT combined with image stabilization makes for some nice sharp pictures, compensating nicely for shake, wind or movement which can blur pictures, problems often accentuated in a large zoom.  That said, I could recommend this as a good camera for people with toddlers, pets, or sports fans.  It gets nice action shots.The SL1000  offers a full range of options for manual control, as well as auto focus and the ability to effectively use it as a point & shoot.  Unlike many cameras in this price range it provides the option of shooting Raw.  Several creative filters are available, as well as the ability to do panorama stitch in-camera (and stitch video as well).  The only thing which took this camera down a notch in my eyes is that the color reproduction was not as accurate as on 2 other cameras I compared it to (a Lumix travel zoom and PEN micro 4/3).  Granted this is not comparing apples with apples, however, in terms of sharpness, depth, overall quality, it compared nicely, producing better pictures than the other 2 in most circumstances!  The colors on the Fuji were just a little hot, popped too much, or seemed unnatural on some shots (most evident on pink & red flowers).  There is still some temptation on my part to give this 5 stars taking price into account, as in truth comparing it to a camera which costs 3x as much or is a completely different format is not really fair.The bottom line is that it shoots nice crisp pictures, provides a huge amount of flexibility and has a good solid build at a very reasonable price point.  It's a combination which is tough to match.", "Date": "July 21, 2013"}, {"Title": "Good feature rich camera for the price", "Author": "Patrick Holt \"txdragon\"", "ReviewID": "R2BDNBPOYYTWQ3", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "I have the previous version of the camera, and its nice to see that they listened to some suggestions for the new version.

Lens optic have improved, pictures are much sharper3. Better low light capability with less noise at higher ISO but not on par with bigger sensor camera's but that's to be expected.4.

I have a couple of older point-n-shoot cameras and a DSLR.  I wanted something that was better than the smaller cameras, but not as complicated as a DSLR.  This seems like the perfect choice.  For most things I really, really like this camera.  It has a couple of things I don't like.So, let's start with all the cool features.The video capability on this thing is AMAZING!  There are so options from FULL HD to high speed filming!  I'm not sure how often I will use the HS filming, but it sure was funny to watch my 5.5 month old jumping in his jumperoo in slow motion.  The HD is beautiful quality.  I was amazed how awesome it looks on my computer.  And to record?  Just push the little red dot button--no need to change modes (a pain and you can easily miss something if you are changing modes to go from still to video).There are tons of different setting options.  You can do full manual, aperture priority, shutter priority, Auto, and Auto select (it detects the type of photo for you).  You can essentially act like you have a DSLR (without lens options) or a point-n-shoot.The lens is super HUGE.  I know all the reviews mention this, but it is important to mention.  This thing goes from wide-angle to super close-up.  WOW.  Just WOW.Now, for what I think could be improved.Low-light/medium-light shots are noisy.  When I shoot photos indoors during the day with seemingly plenty of light, the pictures still look grainy.  Plus, they seem a little overexposed and washed out.  There are no vibrate colors at all.  I admit that I don't care to use the flash much, so if I did use the flash it looks better, but it is obvious I used the flash.  Plus, things are still a little overexposed.  I tried changing different settings for this (ISO, shutter, or aperture priority), but nothing seemed to work.  Plus, since I was photographing my kids (5.5-month twins and a 2-year-old), I got a lot of blur.  Leading me to my next nit...The focus is just ok.  I really like my DSLR with a grid of focus points I can choose from.  Here, I am given a few choices, but I cannot pick the specific focus point (outside of tricks of focusing and then moving the camera).  You can do center, continuous, tracking, or multiple.  I was trying to take pictures of my twins, so I had it on multiple, but it kept focusing behind them, so they ended up blurry compared to an in-focus background.Overall, this is a cool camera that does so much for its price-point.  I think it would be great for someone thinking about upgrading to a DSLR, but not wanting to spend that much money on lenses or accessories.  Just be mindful that it is better for outdoor photos and not indoor portraits (unless you like using a flash, which I prefer to use natural light).

This is a new venture for me, and this camera is amazing, but a little big perhaps for what I was thinking of.

I like some of the special features-the function \"wheel\" on the back can be set up so that there is a special filter, effect or function available with the push of a button-I like putting the bright light highlight feature on it-so that I can quickly add depth and character to bright daylight shots.  quickly takes 2 shots, one with and one without flash (you know how great some digital pics come out if you don't use flash?  This lets you choose later!.)  I don't use the zoom on the left of the lens...occas use the view finder, occas move the LCD.  great Panorama, totally automatic.  I think checking the actual dimensions against a camera you already own would be a good idea-I might have wished I had a oh 30 x zoom size of a baseball instead-smaller is sexier, but larger can also be sexier!

I've taken pictures of the moon with it that show more detail than my astronomical telescope does.

Not at DSLR level like with the wide aperture lenses, but lot better than the standard point-n-shoot.- Size is definitely not too small. Under most conditions you will need a belt-pack at least. It may fit in a jacket pocket in winters.- A/S/M mode shooting is not very convenient and easy to go with. However, I have 2 other DSLRs and if I am in a situation where I really need that perfect shot with all the right settings, I will go with a DSLR. For most other daily purposes, this one will work fine.- Battery life is on the lower side which surprised me a little, but its not really a dealbreaker if you are not one of those \"photography day trips\" kind of people.- At very high zooms, the pictures can be blurred or shaky, so it will depend on the user to get the best use out of this. I think it works well upto 40X.- Screen tilt option is really very useful, especially if you trying to get an infant to look at the camera \uf04a.- One issue which I have noticed is that the colors are not always consistent under the same set of lighting. For example, in our living room the lighting sources are always same but still I notice the color rendering to be different at times.

The on/off switch is tricky and can make you try more than once to start the camera up. When finally engaged, start up is fast but still slower than the Canon Powershot SX40 and SX50. If you take burst frames at the maximum file size, it will stop to save the frames taken causing a loss of action. Use a lower size option if quality isn't an issue.My biggest problem with the camera is the inconsistency of photo quality under the same lighting conditions. It will over or under expose using the same aperture, speed and lighting conditions in a 2 or 3 minute time frame. I'm use to having all photos taken within a short time having similar characteristics as long as they are taken in the same conditions.The 16mp capability is great. Most photos do come out looking beautiful just fewer than I usually get with other cameras. The panorama feature is effortless and gives fantastic results without having to stitch a series of photos together at the computer. Since you don't have to reposition the camera for each shot and instead pan the vista, there is less problem with cloud and shadow movement.An unthinkable oversite by Fuji is not being able to attach filters for protection of the lens and other uses. The greatest plus is the zooming capability. It truly does bring the smallest object up close. Although I have gotten good photos hand-holding the camera at maximum zoom, do use a tripod. It improves your chances of a great shot each time and is less tiresome than straining to hold the camera steady.  Carry a tripod and use it. You'll be glad you did.Download a user's manual if you didn't get one with the camera.

It's easy to hold and the separation between the buttons is good. The barrel of the lens makes a steady platform to hold the camera and surprise, there's a second zoom control on the side of the lens so you can zoom while keeping your trigger finger on the button. The surprises continue with the presets and programs, things you didn't even know you needed! For example, Motion Panorama 360- hold the shoot button down and turn in a circle and you get a 360 degree view. Check out the product description for the other features and you'll still probably be surprised by a feature when you get it. The rear display adjusts to perpendicular when viewing down while shooting low and to about 45 degrees down to view when holding the camera over your head.

I own a Sony NEX 7 which granted is not on the same league as this one and can't really be compared to it in any way but that's why I want you to understand my opinion.- Camera is fairly heavy and even though you can get a good grip holding it, I don't really see someone with a small hand being able to hold it very well- The view finder is pretty subpar in terms of quality- Yes the zoom is 50X and very powerful but in terms of quality the end result is pretty bad in terms of noise- The LCD display can be tilted but it has it limit- I will post some photos taken from my apartment without a tripod and you'll notice what I am talking about.There comes a point where you either want a power zoom or you want good photos, for the price of this camera I would rather recommend you buy something from Sony or Canon without a crazy zoom but that will be able to take good photos.

To make matters worse, Fujifilm has has the camera for a month, and still doesn't have an ETA on the repair time.UPDATE 2: Now almost two months later, and the camera is still with the repair center \"waiting on parts\". Disgraceful compamny.Crikey - what an overlooked and awesome camera this is. Amazing how a once mega brand like Fuji can barely even find shelf space at the local electronics store when they make brilliant cameras like this. Lets start with the obvious - that lens! When fully extended, it just looks plain silly, but the range is fan-tas-tic! Sitting on a patio, I spotted something tiny, pulled out the camera and zoomed all the way into the point where my eyes could barely even see that far.Photos come out almost perfect - at full length, you obviously lose a lot of light, so don't expect to use it in anything other than daylight, but on auto the results are a step above most P&S;'s in this price range.Add things like a great sensor (for the price), hotshoe, viewfinder (with eye-sensor), tilting screen, support for RAW, 10FPS and even 60FPS hd movies and you have a true winner. This thing even beats the similar Nikon and Canon products hands-down.Downsides - it is big - DSLR big, the lens at full length feels \"wobbly\" and there is no remote/mic input. But at $329, this thing can not be beat.", "Date": "June 30, 2013"}, {"Title": "Pigspop", "Author": "Pigspop", "ReviewID": "R7111LEKBU7LQ", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "Got the camera today, 6/18/13, impressed within the first 15 minutes.

I dont know the technical stuff about the cameras, but heres what i have experienced with both the \"Fuji sl1000\" and the \"Canon sx50 hs\". I would rather do a video, but it will take longer than 10mins.Trust me i already tried to talk about 1 camera in under 10 mins, and its very hard to do.Which is probably why nobody posted a video.  First of all the Fuji camera came with everything you need to operate the camera and the link cable so that one could upload the photos to the internet. The Canon camera didnt come with a \"basic instruction manual\". It came with a disk.  The fuji came with a disk also but it came with a \"paper manual\" as well. The Canon didnt even come with a link cable.The Fuji Camera is cheaper than the Canon, but came with more. Yay for Fuji! :DFuji is more difficult to navigate than Canon. On the outside, Canon has more options(buttons) than the Fuji.  Canon comes out of the box ready to use. When you turn the Canon on, all you do is point, Zooooooom and shoot. You will get the 200x(optical+digital), yes i said 200x zoom right out of the box. But not the Fuji. Fuji you will get only the 50x right out of the box. Which almost made me give the fuji a \"not so good\" review.  Yes you can get the 200x zoom with the Fuji, in order to do so you must \"Press the Playback (button w triangle inside of square)Button, Press Left on the FN(function dial), then press Down to select the settings option,  Press Right, then scroll down to \"INTELLIGENT DIGITAL ZOOM\", then turn it on. After that, back out then press menu button, scroll down to \"INSTANT ZOOM\" then select  2.0x, and after you do that, back out and now you have 200x zoom. This formula equals (50xoptical + 50xdigital= 100x then 100x times 2.0x = 200x) NOTE : when you turn on Instant Zoom, you decrease the screen view to a little box. AND you must turn on INSTANT DIGITAL ZOOM everytime you cut the camera off. There may be away to prevent that like by using the custom feature.  When the \"Canon\" zooms to its max zoom, it does so smoothly, while focusing alot better than the \"Fuji\", and maintains focus alot better than the \"Fuji\" also. When zooming with the \"Fuji\", the Fuji is noticeably louder than the Canon.  According to the LCD screen on the camera, Canons photos look better than the Fuji photos. But i wont judge these two by the LCD screen. Again The Canons photos via LCD screen looks better than the Fuji.  I like both cameras and both camera zooms, i like the ease of use of the zoom with canon, better. so therefore i choose the canon over the fuji when it comes to the zoom, and clarity.  Note : Canon is a 12 megapixal and Fuji is a 16 megapixel camera.  Not sure how they effect the zoom.  That concludes my experience and opinion of these two superzoom cameras, super zooms :D  Oh yea i have seen ppl say that theres no way to cut off the automatic electric view finder on the Fuji. Well, they are wrong. You can do such by pressing the EVF button one time for off, another press to move the view to EVF, another press to turn automatic EVF off.Update: I was just playing with the ADV mode and 3D mode on the Fuji, this Camera is soo nice i will post a picture or few from ADV mode.", "Date": "June 5, 2013"}, {"Title": "Savings", "Author": "Elizabeth Parris", "ReviewID": "R3PRANR7SL6CAL", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "Im sooo mad!!
