What happened to a simple point-n-shoot?  For example, I dislike finding which functions allow a forced flash and which don't.  I prefer modifying photos on a computer, not on the camera.

If you put the camera in front of your computer screen and use it to record a decent quality video and you write down what you\u2019re going to say, you can go through about 16 pages of dialog in Microsoft Word, Times New Roman 14 font, with narrow margins.  The battery on the A2600 looks like a big memory card.  Its cannon battery pack NB-11L 3.6 V, 680 mAH, 2.5 Wh (Lithium Ion).  V = Volts, mAH = milli (x.001) Ampere Hours, Wh = Watt Hours.  You can buy a newly manufactured one from [...] that still needs to be charged for $25.64 (including shipping and handling), or you can get a new, refurbished battery from, [...] for $9.50 (including shipping and handling).  That\u2019s delivered to your mailbox.  If you use the camera for trips or shoot a lot of video, you will want another battery.  Otherwise, you won\u2019t need one for around the house.  You\u2019ll need a USB cord that goes into the small USB connector for the camera.  ($2)  You\u2019ll see a little cylinder on the cord itself.  That\u2019s a noise filter or voltage spike filter, common on all such cords i.e. it doesn't do anything else.  (Still $2).  When you get all your stuff, you\u2019ll probably have a couple batteries, the charger, the camera, the USB cord and one or more memory cards.  A little bag for it - is something I would get after you see what you have to put in it.  ($10 at WalMart).  The controls all make sense.  There is no cryptic non-sense to figure out.  The camera body is thinner than I thought it would be and it fits in the front pocket of my work shirts.  I\u2019m very happy with that.  I haven\u2019t tried out the camera at all yet.  That\u2019s because I own Video Studio Ultimate.  It allows me to pick out shots from the video.  The video files are in MOV format.  If you want MPEG4, you need to convert it.

Kirkish \"stephenkirkish\"", "ReviewID": "R3RIFW9LCKICTQ", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "We got the A2600 to add a low-cost camera to go along with our Canon PowerShot S100 compact digital camera. The A2600 is a fine point and shoot that performs well and produces quality images. A step up from the A2500, it grows the back display LCD from 2.7\" to 3\" (diagonal) and adds face recognition capabilities. It appears to be solidly built, and is lightweight, weighing about 5oz. (S100 weighs 7oz). The A2600 has two shooting modes: Auto and Program; it lacks advanced modes like Manual and Aperture and Shutter Preferred modes found on more expensive compacts, which is OK for this level of camera. Overall, I'm pleased with the performance and photo quality, given the lower price point and knowing that it's not my primary, full-function camera.General Comments:The 3\" diag. LCD screen (2-3/8\" x 1-3/4\") is bright and sharp, easy to view in daylight conditions. Also, darker scenes are shown with enough detail (although very grainy) to compose a shot. The lens shows slight barrel distortion at wide, middle and 5x zoom levels, comparable to S100 lens. The zoom range is (35mm equiv.): 28mm - 140mm optical, up to 560mm equiv. with added digital zooming. The \"Auto\" mode decides what kind of picture you're taking (people? bright/dark scene? moving?) and adjusts exposure and focus quickly and appropriately. \"Program\" mode allows you to adjust exposure (through exposure compensation) and image quality (ASA, image contrast) a bit.The camera has a number of features found on more expensive cameras, as well as a few special effects modes. Check them out in the camera manual, found online at Canon's website on the A2600 product page, under \"Brochures and Manuals.\"Pros:After reading the quick start instructions, basic operations were easy. The manual provides more details, particularly on Auto and Program modes. Color saturation looks good, comparable to the better S100. Image color looked realistic and accurate. I saw negligible to no chromatic aberrations, like R, G or B color bleeds at high-contrast edges. I like the flash and the fact that it\u2019s not a popup. It is sufficiently bright to provide good fill lighting in bright conditions, and gives nice, even lighting to low-light scenes without blowing them out.For Movies, the lens can be zoomed during recording. Zoom is smooth, but zoom motor is picked up by the microphone. Record button on back panel makes starting movie simple and quick. Record \u201cstop\u201d can be done using the Shutter button, easier than using record button to stop.Cons:The maximum equivalent ASA is 1600 (6400 in \u201clow-light\u201d mode \u2013 grainy). Image gets \"noisy\" (looking grainy and non-crisp) in typical room-light conditions, where camera operates at ASA 800 or 1600. This is due to 16MP sensor - a 10-12MP sensor will typically produce better results. Thus, image quality is adequate but not fantastic in low-light. Slight grainy noise also seen at ASA 250, resulting in a slight loss of definition, fine details and edge crispness.Image processing after taking the picture is much slower than the S100. It takes 2 seconds after pressing the button for the camera to be ready for another shot (tested for 8MB (M1) and 16MB (L) settings.) The S100 takes less than 1 sec.Many of the niftier functions are buried in menus, making it less likely one will take the time to use these modes. You will probably not navigate to \"low-light\" mode to capture someone blowing out a candle in a dark room, but take your chances with Program or Auto modes. Fortunately, those easy-to-access modes produce fine results in most cases.For Movies, the lens zoom noise can be heard in recording (soft scratch-hiss during zoom.) Microphone is centered on the top of the camera, right above the lens. Zoom switch \"clicking\" may also be recorded.Summary:This camera is a fine point-and-shoot and has enough \"auto\" features to allow you to concentrate on your composition. This is not the best camera to use for huge poster-size prints, but it\u2019s great for uses from e-mails to small photos, calendars, photo books, and even 8\" x 10\" pictures. Have fun with the camera - make your own test shots in various modes that you're likely to use, and find the quickest way to achieve the shot you want.", "Date": "January 18, 2014"}, {"Title": "Good little camera", "Author": "Dot", "ReviewID": "RXGLEUMETIWL", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "Bought it for a gift for my brother, who loves pictures and taking them, but not good with complicated electronics.
