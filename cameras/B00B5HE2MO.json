{"Reviews": [{"Title": "Good point-and-shoot entry level camera", "Author": "David \"Zurasson\"", "ReviewID": "RFM8U4JONMBTD", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "Got this yesterday and like it, had Canon PowerShot A2300 IS 16.0 MP Digital Camera with 5x Optical Zoom (Black) before. Just to note, PowerShot A2500 is an entry-level pocket camera which is very similar to PowerShot A2300: 16-megapixel 1/2.3\" sensor, DiGiC 4 processor, and 5x zoom 28mm wide angle lens, 2.7\" LCD. Even 720p HD video capabilities are the same.Pros:1. What really distinguishes it from its predecessor is Smart Auto Mode recognizing 32 shooting environments and adjusts settings for better quality. It automatically selects the best shooting settings for optimal quality based on the environmental factors (lightning I guess) to provide point'n'shoot simplicity.2. 16.0 Megapixels, with loads of resolution pictures are still clear. High resolution is also good for producing biggest printouts.3. 5x Optical Zoom is sufficient in most cases.4. DIGIC 4 Image Processor. Not as fast as DIGIC 5 though fast and powerful enough to give you advanced system options, provide quick-shoot with reliable performance and low battery consumption. As far as I know DIGIC 4 is currently Canon's most efficient processor for budget cameras. BTW it has some Eco mode, that is said to be providing even faster warm-up times and saves the standard battery, but I haven't tested it yet.5. Very lightweight, just put it into your pocket, can take it everywhere.6. Price tag - $99. You can't get any better camera for the price.Cons:1. Like A2300 it lacks optical image stabilization, though it's got digital image stabilization.2. 1/2.3\" sensor. Well, entry level CCD providing good pictures, not of a DSLR quality, that's all I can say.Summary:Sure this is not the best camera in the world. I definitely knew it when I bought the camera. BUT, I was pleasantly surprised with the quality of pictures I shot.If you're like me (not a pro) and looking for a budget point-and-shoot camera taking family photos and events, mostly shoot in daylight or good lighting, I'd definitely recommend it, taking into account its price tag of $99 - just about right.", "Date": "May 10, 2013"}, {"Title": "Good camera for the price", "Author": "Military Mommy", "ReviewID": "RUIHAQF3LS4E7", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "This is my 6th point and shoot (P&S;) camera in 9 years, ranging in price from $200-$300. I have had 1 Bell & Howell, 3 Nikons and this is my 2nd Canon P&S; camera. The last 2 P&S; cameras I had I literally wore out by taking so many pictures. I bought this as a second camera for my husband (who doesn't usually take pictures) to use when he goes hunting with my son. I chose a Canon because I have a Canon DSLR and love it. I also wanted an inexpensive camera, because I thought it would sit on the shelf for most of the year. Of course it did not come with a memory card, as I have yet to buy any camera that does.To test this camera, after shooting indoors for a bit, I took it to the park. Luckily, what started out as a sunny day turned cloudy, allowing me to test the camera in different lighting. This is a typical low priced P&S; camera.  Like all P&S; cameras, this one performs best in bright, outdoor lighting. However, the ease of use and quality of pictures for the small price tag makes this a good buy. This is one of the better P&S; cameras I have had.Although no instruction manual was in the box (other than the very basics), it was easy to figure out how to manually set this camera, which is a must for me. I liked the fact that it has a PROGRAM setting, which allows me to set a program manually. Even if I switch to another setting, it saves my manual settings, allowing me to switch back and forth between settings. That was great when I tested it, because the lighting went from sunny to cloudy and back again. I could easily switch from AUTO to LANDSCAPE to PROGRAM (my manually programmed settings) and back, depending on lighting and activity, all while holding my 6 month old. The pictures I took while holding my baby (who was trying to grab the camera) of my 4 other children who were riding a moving train turned out surprisingly good. I also manually adjusted the ISO to 1600 and took some shots while holding my squirming baby, and the pictures were not as noisy as I thought they would be.This is a great camera for the price. I would definitely recommend it for anyone, especially those who are ready to do some manual adjustments to get better pictures, but not ready to spend a lot of money. I am glad I bought this camera, and I am happy because I think I will actually use it more than I originally thought!", "Date": "July 16, 2013"}, {"Title": "Works pretty well, can zoom up to x16!", "Author": "TTKira", "ReviewID": "R3IXN246G58YKG", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "The camera takes excellent pictures and videos, the price... you can't go wrong. I just wish it came with a cable as well to transfer pictures to my PC, instead of having to remove the SD card. This does not come with a memory card, i bought a \"Transcend 16GB Class 10 SDHC Flash Memory Card (TS16GSDHC10E)\" together with this and it works well. The camera is very lightweight, and does not look nor feel as though it can withstand any small fall for shock impact, so be careful with it.Ok an edit to my review: I just tried taking pictures of the moon and venus phenomena (08-09-13) and i realized that this camera zoomed up to 16times! Not just up to x5! After x5 it kept going, x8...x10....x16! I got an awesome pic at x16 of the moon and the planet.", "Date": "September 3, 2013"}, {"Title": "TERRIFIC  VALUE", "Author": "Robert E.

I've had this camera for about three weeks and we have used it a lot since we got it. It looks nice and seems to be solid yet light and compact. Here are the pros and cons I found.pros:-light and compact-takes great pictures-good looking-lots of options for a camera of its sizecons:-display screen makes pictures look crappy till their put on computer-very sensitive to movement-focus is sensitive-can't take very distant photos in low lightingNow when I say it is sensitive to movement it directly relates to the focus. It is not very forgiving for those who don't have steady hands or something to prop against, but it can sure take a hell of a photo if you are still.

Storrs", "ReviewID": "R176XONIJAR2IO", "Overall": "3.0", "Content": "I bought this camera for my son for his 12th birthday because of the price and the fact that I have an older model Canon Powershot that I love.  I was disappointed when I received the camera.  It is very lightweight, to the point of feeling very cheap.  My son really liked it though, very easy to use.  The wrist strap that comes with the camera is not adjustable so it does not tighten on your wrist.  We were in a cave in Colorado three days after he received it and he was taking a picture and the camera slipped out of his hand and since the wrist strap was not tightened on his wrist, it fell to the rock floor and broke.  I called Canon to see about getting it repaired.  It was a minimum $89 plus shipping to and from.  The camera cost me $85 including shipping thru Amazon.  Obviously this was no one's fault but my son's (although obviously he did not intend to drop it) but I don't know why a reputable company like Canon would cut such a cheap corner on their wrist strap and not make it adjustable.  I called Amazon to see if by any chance they would let me purchase a new one a a reduced cost, not expecting them to let me, and understandably so.  The Amazon rep sent me a brand new camera with free shipping and even sent a pre-paid UPS label to return the broken camera.  I have always been so impressed with Amazon's customer service.  The camera is alright, takes good pictures, but definitely buy a better wrist strap for it.  But so grateful to Amazon for replacing this for us!", "Date": "August 19, 2013"}, {"Title": "Cannon Pocket Camera", "Author": "Barney E.

Tucker", "ReviewID": "R15ZAV45X2CCJ7", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "As a long time Canon compact camera user my favorite new features on the A2500 are...The Canon PowerShot A2500 does not just stop at taking images but is rather adept at handling videos as well. It is capable of producing 720p HD files at the touch of a button. One of the thoughtful things about this camera is the inclusion of the movie button. You do not have to fidget about with all sorts of controls in order to get the video going. Rather you go back to that simple button and the rest is history.Another nice feature is that this product is newly minted with an ECO mode which is designed to reduce the power consumption on your camera.The Canon brand has made cameras its specialty and the Canon PowerShot A2500 holds true to type. This model brings out all the features that you would expect of a camera of its class but has the added advantage of making it easier for the consumer to access those features. In other words you get the best of both worlds with a great camera and easy usage.Verdict:There are no major surprises with the Canon PowerShot A2500. It is a great camera that does what it says on the box.If you are looking for the next model up check out the Canon SD330 as it has another level of features and quality.http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00B5HE3UU/ref=as_li_ss_tl?ie=UTF8&camp;=1789&creative;=390957&creativeASIN;=B00B5HE3UU&linkCode;=as2&tag;=stupisms-20", "Date": "June 19, 2013"}, {"Title": "Powershot A2500", "Author": "Michelle Garringer", "ReviewID": "RU6LF7GX7B1VR", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "i bought the powershot for a class reunion weekend and it excelled! it gave me several hundred of the nicest photos i've ever taken and i cant wait to take it out and take some more photos! a couple videos too that also was very easy to do. what i really like about the powershot is you can SEE the photos right as you take it,  so say one was blurry due to new user error. it shows you the photo and you can say right away \" nope try again\"  that was VERY handy along with showing people thier photos in case they wanted a try #2. same with erasing very easy.before i bought this i knew nothing about Digital cameras, the last one i had was a film camera ten years ago. so this was my first digital camera purchase, and what a brilliant purchase it was, the amazon reviews and basic instructions were enough to know what i need and how use it, you must have a photo memory card ( not sent with the camera so when it says do you want the package YES you do!)  and you must charge the battery beforehand and check it, if you are away from home make sure you take the battery charger and if you've used it alot check the battery i forgot to do that and the third night i couldnt take photos. it warned me.. i just thought.. nah.. it will be okay. ( nope but once it charged it was fine) but not only was it easy for me to take clear wonderful photos of my reunion weekend, it was easy for my friends taking photos with it too to just use it as well.  the automatic sensing flash was nice too. the digital uploads of the photos ( with separate purchase of the cable) also could not have been easier. i also liked the little bag that came with the package. it had a nice belt clip. also if i didnt have a belt loop it was very easy to tuck in my pocket and not have to schlump a large camera and case along. it was dropped by accident on a hardwood floor and kept on going with no problems.  everybody went oh no! and i was like nope! its good! say cheese!the price couldnt have been nicer also.. very pleased with my new Canon Powershot!", "Date": "July 1, 2013"}, {"Title": "A Great All Rounder", "Author": "KS DEED", "ReviewID": "RO8FJ6H4XSHQ7", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I am a fan of Canon Camera's, and have an older version of the Canon Rebel. However although I really bought this camera for my wife, I do enjoy taking it with me when I am out myself. It is easy to slip into the pocket, and quick to get ready to take a photo. The quality of the photos is brilliant. The colors are so vivid, and real. The Auto-focus is perhaps the best that I have seen is a compact digital camera. The screen shows what points the camera is focusing on, so you know instantly your subject is in focus - of it you need to re-frame your image.Most importantly the actual photo taking is quick. Some digital cameras will blur when the subject moves at the point the photo is taking, because of the delay in processing the photo onto your memory card. I've not had any such problems with this camera.I would recommend this camera to serious photographers who, like me just like to carry a camera everywhere they go.

There are hints and tips built into the camera and an online 107 page manual is available. I did have some initial trouble with the Canon website but was eventually able to print it.The \"case\" is a flimsy piece of something so a real case will have to be purchased separately unless you buy the bundle.I've used it for moving targets, outdoor holiday displays, and portraits and all are crisp, clean, and blur free.So far, so good with this item.", "Date": "December 25, 2013"}, {"Title": "Cannon PowerShot A2500 is a very nice camera with choices", "Author": "Chase", "ReviewID": "R2J3P9FGP9LE8X", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "The Cannon POWER SHOT A2500 is advertised as a POINT AND SHOOT so I was researching the camera for my own needs.  I had a Panasonic HM-TA2 that was great for simple point and shoot shots but this winter it was destroyed in an accidental crushing ( don't ask ).  The Panasonic was basically Point and shoot with not much more to change, only a few options, it's only down fall was the battery is not replaceable.  I wanted to find an inexpensive POINT AND SHOOT and this camera caught my eye.  You really need to look at what they are saying or even look at the USER MANUAL to understand this camera.POINT AND SHOOT - Yes, in AUTO MODE, this is a very good point and shoot camera.  There is little you need to do but aim the camera.  Even movie mode has a button just for filming movies and yes, point and shoot movies.The camera has an actual 5 power OPTICAL zoom and then it can go up to 15 power DIGITALLY.  The quality is good with the optical zoom and the digital zoom can be from good to not the best but remember it all depends on light conditions, distance and if you zoom the picture up, you need to be absolutely STILL, no shaking or movements.BUT if you want a POINT AND SHOOT that you can address some of the picture processes, this one allows you to make changes as well, this is where the USER MANUAL will become very useful.  This camera allows different settings from setting the telephoto lens, self timer timing to different optic image results.  In all honesty, this is a lot of camera, for the price, for a point and shoot and with the option to be able to adjust your camera to your needs blows away any basic point and shoot camera.The camera itself is very small and when off, the lens will stow away into the body automatically and you can easily place it in your pocket.  The weight of the camera is light so you are not uncomfortable lugging around a heavy camera, a plus if you are on vacation.I like the fact that the battery is replaceable, allowing the use of extra batteries and the memory cards can be exchanged with extreme ease.Ok, what you get, you get the camera in a box, a battery charger and a battery.  You may think it is strange that the memory card is not included, but there are too many choices out there to select a good memory card and be clear on this, there is NO MEMORY built into the camera.  YOU MUST PURCHASE A MEMORY CARD TO TAKE A SINGLE SHOT.  There are several class of memory cards and unless you plan to use the rapid fire picture taking ( 10 shots rapid fire ), a class 4 would do.  Other wise and keeping budding movie directors in mind, class 10 would be a great choice for MOVIE recording.  You also do not get any cords.  This one I didn't really understand.  There  are two cords you might need.  One to connect the camera to the computer, and if you care to, one to connect the camera to the TV.  You also do not get an outside power adaptor but there is a place on the cam to plug one in.  The camera is interesting in low light shots and the cam has a small flash built in good for close shots.  There is an optional HIGH POWER FLASH available to buy if you feel you need that kind of distance from a flash unit.All in all before you run out and buy all the accessories that you may not need, use the camera and get used to it and then determine what you need.  You will need to download the user manual from the Cannon site and then spend time learning how to use the options.  Again, if all you want is a good point and shoot, you'll hardly ever look at the User Manual but if you want to play with the options, the USER MANUAL is your friend.Look for the best price but also consider the accessories you need to get just to make the camera functional and buy the best deal.  I found a site where the camera was dirt cheap but the accessories boost the price way too high.Whether you POINT AND SHOOT or want to adjust your camera to the shots, this camera can help you with your shots.  Also look at the illustrations on UTUBE for a better idea.  also, search the web for the Canon A2500 REVIEWs where individuals and review agencies have actually taken the camera out to see what it will do.  Where they show pictures that this came has taken, they all look GREAT!For those coming from a camera like I had, this one would seem a bit over board for Point and Shoot but after you take a few shots in AUTO mode, it is as easy as pushing the button.  It is a nice choice for a simple camera and a good choice for a starter camera for those who like to make adjustments or are new to the camera field.

Since it's a work camera and I have a tendency to break them every 18-24 months I figured I would go cheap.  The A2500 came with a rechargeable battery and undercut other Canon P&S;' by a good $30-40 so I figured why not.I knew I was giving up OIS and LCD size, those things show up on the specs, but here are some things to be aware of:1 - It's all plastic construction, not metal, and it feels like it.2 - The controls are \"dumbed down\" from previous Canon P&S;, the focus mode selector (Left on D-pad - Macro, normal, infinite) now selects eco mode (how often is that something you change?), and the exposure selector (up on d-pad) is now delete/mode selector.3 - The battery is small, not sure how long it'll last4 - Despite using  the same DIGIC 4 processor as the Elph 100 HS, the continuous shooting speed is much lower (using the same memory card from the Elph)1, 2 and 3 I can live with, but 4 may be a deal breaker for me because I use the continuous shooting all the time.The picture quality is excellent for an economy unit.

I need  wide lens features and the ability to fade out unwanted subject in the background.. I have not learned how to use all the features. I have taken very nice shots and not so nice shots experimenting. I find that sharpness is something to be explored in the manual. I am sure Canon tries to keep cost down by not providing a printed out manual but I wanted one and I did the unthinkable:-- printed it out! put it in a three ring  binder! old school I guess! I can point and shoot as described in the product section of this listing. This camera is a nicely priced one and If I should get careless again only this time drive over it!, well it won't cost me an arm and a leg to replace!.. The manual consists of 109  pages! That means there is a lot to learn! I went to manual websites to see how much a manual would cost to buy.

I got it for $59 recently and I do see price fluctuations on this website. I was a little thrown by what appears to be fewer buttons than my last Canon. For camera operation go to Canon.com and look at the manual; they also have the software to download to your computer so you can transfer images. This is the smallest, lightest weight, fit in your shirt pocket camera I've seen. For $59 it was a super bargain. And it has a great deal of versatility of operation for the interested photographer, explained in the manual.

Better than my smartphone which was one of my ultimate desires+Rechargeable and removable batteryCons:-Extremely minor and probably not worth mentioning, but my previous Canon came with a small plastic piece to tighten/loosen the loop on the string that attaches to the camera.  Depending on the shot, I like to tighten the loop around my wrist in case I drop the camera-Lag between photos.  This is the reason I returned the camera.  I found I was missing lots of shots because of the delay in between taking photos.  No other reviews on Amazon mentioned lag between taking photos and there is a noticeable difference even between this canon and my 5 year old canon I intended to replace. I picked this camera over a Nikon with a couple more features I would have rather had because the Nikon had lots of reviews mentioning horrible lag between photos.I realize this is a very short review, bu given my short time with the camera its all I could think of and based on the camera I received.", "Date": "April 28, 2014"}, {"Title": "Okay camera for okay price", "Author": "D.

The external charger has no cord, just two prongs that flip out to plug into a socket. you have to remove the battery to charge it. The flash is in the left corner at the top, so if you use two hands to hold the camera, make sure you don't cover the flash, especially if you have gloves on. If you try to use one hand, you have to be especially careful where you put your thumb, or you will hit the function/scroll button. Which has multiple functions, It is labeled Eco, delete/auto, flash, Disp. Other times it is a scroll button, but its not marked with arrows, so you have to guess what is going to happen when you press it.

It also has the DIGIC 4 chip (that's something important, one smart brain in this box). It has a 28mm wide angle as does the A4000. It has only a 5X optical, 5X digital zoom. The \"IS\" stands for Intelligent systems, and while BOTH cameras take awesome pictures and represent for normal folks super deals that will keep up with the far more expensive cameras (like those listed above) for normal use, the A4000 IS deals with tricky lighting and the outer margins of early morning, late evening, backlit scenes, and so on, better than the A2500. BOTH are super deals. My tired eyes appreciate that larger display on the somewhat more expensive A4000 IS. I also like to \"crop tight\" meaning I really zoom in. That again is a slight advantage to the A4000 IS. If photography isn't a passion, either will do a great job.

As expected, my old camera just didn't hold up to this and the D90. Not only were the pictures slightly sharper, but the coloring and shading were much more natural looking. There were only a few blurry images, but she was laughing at the time so it is to be expected. Perhaps the reviews I read complaining of blurriness had defective ones.  We lucked out and found this for $50, which I think is a good deal. Just as a side note, the red one we have looks dark pink in natural lighting.

So, I would suggest to anyone looking to buy one to google 'camera trait search' and get the whole picture.The A2500 is a fixed lens camera (point and shoot, some would say), with 16 resolution (megapixels), and a x5 zoom. The sensor size is 1/2.3 inch CCD-type, which is standard for cameras of its class.If you were to, say, take pictures of friends and family at an outdoor gathering, this camera is what you need. If you get ambitious, there will be stumbling blocks. Here is the camera's trait mix: It does not have a viewfinder, which, again, many in its class don't. The ISO rating, which is the gauge for how well it does in low light, is 1600. That rating is lower than many others, but it is sufficient for most purposes. The video is a Full HD- that is 1980x1080 resolution. It does not have a hot shoe for an external flash option. That is not unexpected for its size and category. The LCD screen is a 230,000 resolution. The camera does not do RAW processing but you would need only if you did not want to be limited by JPEG type storage. It comes with WiFi- very convenient for easy upload. The weight of the camera is a convenient 135 grams.Overall, nice, fun camera. Having been into photography for a while, I do stress though that you do a camera trait search. That will also tell you more about what you want.", "Date": "March 11, 2014"}, {"Title": "Not bad for its price", "Author": "Becky", "ReviewID": "RBSIHJTO8WA0", "Overall": "3.0", "Content": "Similar to the camera I bought three years ago, an older version of the Canon PowerShot (SD980, I believe).

I needed a cheap camera fast and I got mine within two days. The charger plugged directly into the wall with a place for the battery to sit. So far so good. But unlike all other cameras I have bought, it did not even come with a starter memory card. When I took a picture, it told me \"Cannot Record.\"  And there was no USB cable to connect to my computer either. That's a new one for me too.I repeat there is no memory card and no USB cord, so you can neither take a picture nor view it.But it did say in the book that there was a \"*power cord,\"(asterisk included) written in smaller font on the starter page under Package Contents. But there was no such thing. Then under the first step, \"Charging the Battery, \" it tells you to, \"Plug the power cord into the charger, then plug the other end into a power outlet.\" I was able to charge my battery without this power cord. It was only by using a powerful light that I could see that on the back of my battery charger was the model number inscribed as CB-2LF, and I did not need this power charger. Such needless aggravation.I have a wee website in which I am Amazon affiliate and I was going to write a review. But it looks like that will have to wait until the add-ons I ordered today come in. So much for trusting Amazon to give me the full low-down. It should come with a huge caution sign for buyers, especially at this price. These things do add up. How can you make a price/feature comparison if you have to calculate so many variables? Furthermore, a camera at this price, might be  for a gift, and the gift recipient would be pretty bummed if they had to order additional items just to make the Canon Powershot A2500 work.The bigger problem will be when I get the memory card and the proper USB cord, what happens if I don't like the picture of the camera or how it functions? Will the aftermarket companies allow me to send back their products and get a refund that includes the shipping cost? It would have been so much more convenient for Canon to sell a complete package.I guess  learned my lesson. The product description on Amazon gave the features of the camera. But it did not list what came in the box. I should have read through each review and customer Q & A to glean what was still needed to make this camera fully operable.If this were a car it would be missing its steering wheel, and other car stuff, which I can't think of the analogies, because I am so frustrated.But there are three nice things I can tell you: The cherry red is easy to spot in a dark purse and it is very, very light weight.
