I used the included software to edit the video remove the sound. Bear in mind that the video size/quality had to be reduced to share on Amazon.My wife and I did a lot of research online looking for a camera with a 10x or larger zoom, video capability, low light w/o flash and most of all easy to use. We first purchased the Coolpix L610 Nikon COOLPIX L610 16 MP Digital Camera with 14x Zoom NIKKOR Glass Lens and 3-inch LCD (Black) at our local Best Buy because it was on sale and over $100 cheaper than the L820. This was a mistake, we got the camera home and it just didn't take the pictures we expected (flash picture came out almost black and the zoom wasn't as awesome as I had hoped for :) plus more poor reviews than I had noticed). After reading about this camera the L820 and finding that it was actually only $50 more than the L610, we exchanged the L610 for the L820 and we couldn't be happier.I am not a photographer but I like to take pictures and I like them to come out well. This camera allows you to set the camera to Auto mode and not have to think about much else besides finding something to take a picture of. The camera is laid out well, making it easy to choose from the many different modes and preset features to allow you to take best pictures possible, so I think it suits the novice and an intermediate photographer. The zoom is in two places on the top near the shutter release and on the left side of the lens housing which is a nice touch.The 30x optical zoom is amazing, allowing us to take close up pictures of wild life without disturbing them and the detail is stunning. So far, we have taken some beautiful pictures of flowers and deer. I will continue to update the review as we take more pictures and some video as well.We purchased a 16gb memory card which can hold over 3500 pictures on the highest setting or over 2 hours of HD video. We also bought this charger and batteries eneloop NEW 2000mAh Typical, 1900mAh Minimum, 1500 cycle, 4 Pack AA, Ni-MH Pre-Charged Rechargeable Batteries with 4 Position Charger so we will never have to worry about buying batteries again. We will get another set for back up sometime soon.The only issues I have with the camera so far is that the lens cap is secured to the case and not the lens, so you must make sure to take the cap off before turning on the camera. Also, I wish they included the micro HDMI cable like Mediabridge Micro-HDMI to HDMI Cable with Ethernet - (6 Feet) - FLEX Series High Speed then you can hook up your camera to your TV and show your HD videos you shot in HD. The cable that is included is your simple RCA inputs and that wont display in HD.Overall for $200 we couldn't have asked for more. 30x zoom, 16 mp, awesome low light capabilities, easy to shoot, fast turn on time and many more features. I would recommend this camera to anyone looking for a powerful camera on a budget.Updated 6/28/13 - We added a few pictures to the image gallery to show the quality pictures the camera takes. We are by no means photographers but the camera does all the work for us. We are very pleased with this camera.Update 8/6/13 - We have taken probably 100+ pictures and at least 10 minutes of video and we are still on the original batteries after 6 weeks of use. We still love the camera and we haven't found a real fault yet! The videos have come out amazing, we couldn't be happier.Amazon has removed the pictures we posted, looks like all customer images are being removed, which is a shame.We have been able to transfer pictures with out using any software or drivers on my 10 year old spare XP laptop using the provided USB cable. The file transfer speed is very quick. I would suggest if you have any troubles with transferring pictures that a card reader is a great way to go and easy to use method of transferring files from any type of card. IOGEAR SD/MicroSD/MMC Card Reader/Writer GFR204SD (Green/Gray) would work excellent for this.Update 12/2/13 - Used the timer feature and a tripod for Thanksgiving pictures and they couldn't have come out better. The flash on the camera is bright and accurate taking pictures of what you see with great color. Again, the camera has not disappointed yet.Thanks to everyone for the nice comments and I hope I can answer any questions you may have.Thanks for reading and I hope my review was helpful!", "Date":

I'm not a professional photographer. I'm just a guy who goes on photo kicks now and again to indulge my inner paparazzi. I think everything needs to be commemorated and documented for the purpose of later boring my friends and family. A flower, a bird, spilled ice cream... it's all gold! While I'd love a DSLR with a telephoto lens, I just can't justify the cost. Enter the L820. I had a Fujifilm FinePix S4200 Digital Camera which has a nice zoom, but I couldn't get it to focus on what I wanted it to focus on. I'm glad I didn't see a Yeti while using that camera, because the image would be blurry and no one would believe me. The Fuji has good reviews, but I wasn't satisfied so I returned it. I continued my hunt and found the L820. Good reviews, though relatively new so not as many as the Fuji, a good zoom, a good brand. I got a smokin' deal on it from an Amazon reseller (over $100 cheaper than Wal-Mart, and $30 cheaper than Amazon itself) so figured I'd give it a go. Pros and cons are a tried and true review method, so why mess with success?Pros:-Zoom is powerful, and with vibration reduction and a steady hand I captured some decent images without using a tripod. I never bother with digital zoom, but there's no real need given that the optical zoom is so powerful.-Image quality is good. It's not great, but it's good. Remember, this is basically a point and shoot with a lens on steroids.-Shooting modes. I've only just begun to play with these. There are color filter options, so you can have a black and white photo showing only red, or blue, or green, or whatever. It's artsy and interesting, although I don't find it that useful.-Battery life is decent. The 4 double AAs they provide got me 647 shots, and still have a bit of life left in them. I only used flash a few times, probably under 10. As soon as these batteries die I'm going with Eneloops which are the greatest batteries on the face of the Earth if you ask me.-Flash not needed as often as other point and shoots. I have yet to do any spelunking which will probably require a flash, but in low light situations I found the flash could stay down and not be used and pictures turned out pretty good. I'm not a camera genius, but I think this my have something to do with the CMOS sensor being used rather than a CCD, but don't quote me on that.-Low shutter lag. Isn't this what always gets you? Look, that puppy is tap dancing while twirling a hula-hoop! Quick camera, take a picture. Then you hear the \"vvvvffff\", \"vvvvffff\" sound of the lens trying to focus. You see the image get blurry, blurrier, not as blurrier, clearer, clear... and snap. The dog is now sniffing another dog's butt, and no one believes what you saw. It's not instant, but it's pretty fast.-Good grippy material for preventing slipping. Nothing is worse than taking photos from a boat with your new camera when a rogue wave causes a shudder and PLUNK, your new photo machine goes in the drink because its smooth sides provided no friction. Where the battery housing is there lives a nice, rubbery grip that allows a steady hold. Of course, you should have the neck strap on anyway, so even if it does slip, it's still attached to you.-AA batteries. This is the must have item for me. I hate proprietary batteries that aren't readily available. Nothing is worse than traveling and having your battery die. Sure you can charge it, but that takes time. Being able to swap out some AA batteries which are easy to get at your local stop and rob is a huge convenience.Cons:-No view finder. C'mon Nikon, this thing is already too big for my pocket, you might as well add a view finder.-LCD hard to see in bright sun with sunglasses. I know this might be picky, but if it's bright out, and you're outside, you're probably wearing sunglasses to keep your rods and cones from melting. I found that if I wanted to get a good look at the LCD, I had to raise my glasses and allow the UV light of our sun to start burning my retina while reviewing photos or changing settings.-Battery housing door is a pain. I'm not sure if there is any way around this, because the batteries have to have pressure pushing up so they touch the conductive material on the battery door to give your camera power, but it's a pain to close the door. Not a deal breaker, but just something to be aware of because that's also where the SD card resides.Final word:If you're a pro, you might look down your nose at this camera. If you're looking at this camera, and reading this review, you're probably just a regular person like me, or a pro who understands what this camera is for. I'm pleased overall so far. I've uploaded a few pics to the gallery. One of a macro shot, one of a panorama, and one of a deer. The deer photo was taken in \"landscape\" mode, as I forgot to change it and I had been shooting landscapes primarily to that point. The menu is neither a pro nor a con for me. It's not as convenient as a wheel selector would be, but you get used to it fairly quickly.If you're looking for a camera with a bit more oomph than a typical point and shoot, this is a good bet. If image quality is more important to you than zoom, there might be better options out there. Remember, I found the images to be good, but not great. But for under $200, this is a solid deal if you ask me.Things I have yet to mess around with:-Video, supposedly HD, but I haven't tried it out. I think it's also got a decent frame rate which might allow some interesting \"high speed\" camera stuff.-Burst mode for action shots. Haven't touched it yet.-Messing with F-stops or aperature adjustments. Also haven't tried long shutter.If I do any of these (and remember!) I'll write updates.--- -- UPDATE 09-16-13 -- ---I've had the camera about 3 months now, and am still happy with it. I've played with the high speed filming a bit more. I've uploaded a video \"review,\" expertly crafted using high end video editing software (Windows movie maker), to show what the different speeds look like.There are four high speed options, ranging from 0.5x - 8x. Now, it's a well established fact that men don't like to read instructions, and I'm no exception. So while there may be more info available about what those numbers mean, I didn't look into it. I'll assume, using my very basic camera knowledge, that 8x basically slows footage to 1/8 speed, and 4x is 1/4 speed, etc etc. The video at 4x is actually still fairly decent, but you can really see how grainy it's getting at 8x.If I'm outside or in a well lit room I've very impressed with the shutter speed. If I have to wait for a flash, that slows things down, but outside shots are the fastest I've personally ever had with a point and shoot. Battery life is also still impressive. If you haven't joined the Eneloop cult yet (Sanyo Eneloop Ni-MH Charger and 8 Rechargeable AA and 2 Rechargeable AAA Batteries.Plus C & D Adpater.) do yourself a favor and drink the Koolaid. These are the best batteries I've ever owned.I have not discovered how to use any manual settings with this camera, and I'm afraid they may not exist. These cameras are made to be idiot proof, and they don't want the end user messing with things s/he shouldn't. However, I do like doing long exposure photos of flowing water or the night sky, and I guess I'll have to keep my old, worn out Canon point and shoot for that. I think you have to get a \"P\" line camera from Nikon to have much control over f-stops, aperatures, shutter speeds, etc. Personally, I think Nikon should have a little more faith in me, but that's the way it goes.", "Date": "June 28, 2013"}, {"Title": "Captures the Moment", "Author": "B.

This is my first camera of this type to own and I bought it to capture; kids soccer/volleyball events, birthdays, etc. So far it has performed awesome, the Sports scene is great as it takes multiple shots and you can pick from the best one, like a frame by frame slow motion.

I bought this camera to use in the field (desert & rainforest) and laboratory, imaging rocks, flora, animals, and landscapes (replacing a Nikon Coolpix S550 lost/stolen, and supplementing a bulkier D90 and an inadequate iPhone 4G). The zoom lens and macro features are great - enabling decent, illustrative shots of, say, monkeys in high tree canopies, tiny insects on the forest floor, and in-focus images in variable light settings. This camera is better than most basic point-and shoots, and it's nice that it uses AA batteries. If you have time to set up a shot and try a few different presets, you can get some fantastic images. But in the following other aspects - it is not so good.(1) Customizable settings are non-existent - there is nothing customizable about this camera at all.  You're stuck choosing from Nikon's prepackaged 'modes', which, frankly, used to be more versatile and faster to navigate. Note that this seems to be the same on all of Nikon's current point and shoots - my old camera (the S550) was more user friendly.(2) (Edited; withdrawn complaint!) I stated intially: \"You cannot turn the L820 on to review your photos without first removing the lens cap and letting the lens extend. This is a waste of time and battery life, and it's annoying when you just want to show someone a picture.\" Other users have pointed out that you *can* actually review photos by pressing and holding the play button with the camera off. I learn something new every day - my mistake, and apologies to Nikon for being a doofus.(3) You cannot access the memory card without opening the battery compartment. Why do this? Well, if you're concerned about theft while you're out and about in strange places, keeping your SD card(s) stored separately from your camera isn't a bad precaution. I feel like I'm going to break the spring-loaded, sliding battery/SD card lid every single time I open the thing. It feels flimsy and badly made.(4) The manual flash is aggravating. The camera will ask you to open the flash under many instances (unless you select 'no-flash'), costing you time.(5) The pre-set image modes prevent you from taking shots the camera thinks will be fuzzy - if you're too far, too close, or too zoomed in/out, it simply won't shoot. Did that rare animal just get away? Too bad! You may think a fuzzy picture would have been better than none at all, but that's Nikon's choice to make, not yours. Can't get that weird red or green hue that is so vibrant in your subject as seen with your naked eye? Tough - Nikon knows best how to balance colors (or render them murky).(6) The camera *looks* big and fancy, which is not ideal when you're obviously a tourist or out of place in a foreign city. While too small to misplace or drop, the L820 is too big to cram into a pocket or carry discretely.Again, the zoom is the reason to buy this camera, and with a little set up, you can get first-rate images. So for casual still-life photographers, museum-goers, and landscape lovers, this is fine. I keep this camera around for impromptu documenting of events, quick field trips, and for taking to areas where I wouldn't want to risk damage to or theft of my DSLR (i.e., the beach, known pick-pocket areas, etc.).", "Date": "September 8, 2013"}, {"Title": "Great Camera!

This camera had many more features, took better pictures in low light, and has a good shutter speed.  This camera was just what I needed for family events and our upcoming trip to Alaska.  While in Alaska, this camera took great landscape pictures and portraits, sunsets, and I could even zoom into pics of bald eagles, humpback whales, and mountain goats, and get great shots.

You want to know HOW WELL this camera performs, and you can't find that out from someone who's just taken it out of the box yesterday. I've gone through 3 sets of rechargable batteries with mine. You'll want rechargable 2000-2200mAh NH batteries. The L820 is very busy doing a lot of stuff for you so yes, it eats batteries. You won't mind when you see the pictures, and now I'll tell you why.First off, if this is your first \"Wide-Angle to 30x OPTICAL Telephoto\" lens, like they say at K-Mart, \"You're gonna ship your pants!\". There's no way to write what kind of reaction you're going to have. \"Amazing\" doesn't even start to cover it. I took a shot across a lake at full telephoto, which is combining 30x optical and digital zoom. There was a dude on the other side shoreline with a bucket. I never saw him with my eyes. The picture showed him as if he was 15 feet away from me. I could read the emblem on his shirt! Is this the most amazing thing about the camera? No.I'm an oil painter of illusion and fine realism. The most annoying aspect of using photography as reference material is, having to un-flatten the 2D image a camera produces. Perspective, range, compression; all manner of photographic distortion occurs. I'm here to tell you, this CMOS-senor and processor gets it closer-to-realism than I thought possible! The best part about this camera is, the pictures look far more REAL than any non-DSLR I've tried (Sony, Canon, Panasonic, Samsung). This quality is so huge! You'll read a lot of griping about not having a through-the-lens. The picture quality is well-worth not having it! Going even farther, the Nikon L820 takes actual 3D photos. Yes, needing the glasses kind of 3D...which are printed to PLAIN PAPER. I've done one. It's trick and cool.I'm not done with the list of out-of-this-world incredible this camera does but, this is a review, not a thesis. For brevity, allow me to address some of the negative reviews I've read with suggestions. Yes, throw the lens cap away. It's a pain in the neck but, you were going to lose it anyway. It's an a-u-t-o-matic camera ma'am \\ sir. That means it's doing everything for you so yes, if you're trying to film the Daytona 500 or your hyperactive kids, you MUST learn how to use this camera in Manual Mode. It does have the shutter speed and ISO you need but, you must either allow time for the camera to do it or, do it yourself. In all fairness, I've gotten into a couple of minor arguments with the auto-focus taking MACRO shots. Ah wow! I forgot to add how incredible this thing is close-up! It's got a Wide-Angle lens which is far better than the point-n-shoot offers. No more, \"Okay everybody scrunch in a little closer to get in the picture\". Plus! I've taken great manual pictures < 1\" away  from the lens. Finally, I can take pictures at night, in my house, with only TV lighting the room and, they come out AS BRIGHT AS daylight. No grainy \"aw shucks\" disappointments. I took a picture of my dog on the bed, no overhead lighting, at night, for a test and yes, daylight results AND...I could read the title of a book across the room in the photo! Now, let's speed through the compressed list of unbelievably excellent on this camera: 1080i 30fps video in full stereo. I got the 32gb SD card and it tells me, \"30 mins\" of HD video. It counts like Microsoft tells time so, it's a lot long I'm told in newsgroups.Summary: Picture quality off the charts with \"hidden\" values most folks with just call \"great pictures\". Telephoto and Wide-Angle shots offered rival those of cameras over $400. That's value! Eats batteries. The software is EXCELLENT. BUY THIS CAMERA!!

The camera is wonderful.I own the camera, bought it on Amazon, and have been using it for a while.The \"Most Helpful Critical Review\" makes no sense at all to me, and I'm afraid it may be scaring people away from buying a fantastic camera for no reason.1. THE LENS CAP ATTACHES NORMALLY TO THE LENS, JUST LIKE ANY OTHER CAMERA.  It does NOT attach to the body, as this review says.  Just think: would Nikon, a great company, give you a lens cap that does not fit on the lens???  I've owned Nikons before, and this lens cap is .... just a normal lens cap.  Really.[If you want a slightly more technical explanation, see my PS at the end.]2.  THERE IS NO 'GRINDING' OR 'GRUNTING.'  The camera has a simple safety feature that many other cameras have: If you press the ON button but forget to remove the lens cap first, the camera simply does not extend the lens (which it normally does), and it shows you an error message: \"Lens error.\"  Yes, it does first try to extend the lens--but this takes only a second or less, and it does this gently; then the camera, immediately silent again, just gives you the \"Lens error\" message--a simple reminder to remove the cap.  This is a common safety feature on many cameras, and it works just fine here. No 'grunting' or 'grinding', and no battery use worth mentioning.  Just a quick, one-second jiggle of the lens (as it senses that the lens cap is still on the camera), and then a reminder. Absolutely normal.Don't let the alarming, supposedly 'most-helpful critical review' scare you.  It's sheer nonsense. I bet people rate it 'helpful' because it only 'helped' to scare them off from buying this great camera (which they thus don't have in hand to review).  I've been using this Nikon a lot, it's great quality, and a steal at the Amazon price.  Another excellent Nikon--easy to use, very high quality.  I'm super-glad I bought it.P.S. August 2013.  When people say the cap attaches to the camera \"body,\" they mean it attaches to the end of the Lens Housing.  Because the lens is a mechanical zoom lens, and not a changeable lens, its lens housing is 'attached' to the 'body.'  Put more exactly: the 'body' is a single piece with the lens housing (and there's no camera \"body\" for separate, changeable lenses).In short: The cap attaches to the end of the LENS HOUSING, and fully encloses the movable part of the zoom lens.  Nice feature!  Of course, you want to remove the lens cover from the lens housing before you turn ON the camera, since the movable part of the lens then moves out of its housing.

Personally I prefer the USB adapter as it works with any computer. Well, not some Apple models.Delay between taking pictures may be fixable. Many digital cameras will take a high performance memory chip, reading and writing faster than cheaper memory chips. Always check the owner's manual to see if your camera will benefit from one.Blurry pictures are the biggest complaint. Willing to guess most rookie users press the shutter so hard the camera jerks/moves. You need to be gentle with the tip of your finger on the shutter button, practicing being gentle before you take the important pics.

Wanted to have something \"all-in-one\"  and this camera fits the bill!  (The cost was much better also!)  I live with an awesome view of the ocean and local areas - I have zoomed in on neighborhoods across the bay, used macro for super close-ups of flowers, took natural shots easily because the shutter is so quick, caught birds in flight, and have the most awesome pictures of the moon - craters and all!  We have still not tried all of the settings but are working on it! Our only issue - and this is our problem not the camera is when the camera is in full zoom: 1) If you are not using the highest setting it might be pixelated and 2) it is so sensitive that when you take the shot it \"offsets\" from center.  Of course this could be solved with a tripod but who's carrying one all the time?! The camera is with us all of the time - my mother called it \"my mascot\" -  because you just never know when that super moment will come up!!  The only con to this camera is the same as with all digitals - no eyepiece and there IS a glare in the sun. Absolutely Love it and recommend  the following accessories: rechargeable batteries, a minimum 32gb, class 10 sdhc card - you will need it  :)  - and the screen protector. Go for it!!

Now that I am back from this trip and have over 3000 images to go through, I can say that I am very happy with my decision.  I was made the unofficial trip photographer because no one else's camera could quite keep up with mine.

It often requires getting closer to the subject than is practical (see butterfly reference.) And the resulting image has awkward dimensions.The reviews I read previous to selecting this model often complained of its use of batteries -- \"eats them\" they said.  I haven't found that to be a problem. Perhaps that's because I don't shoot videos.  Good thing, because the door to the battery compartment is very difficult to close.

I was looking for a camera to take pictures at my kids' games and I picked this one because, in Sports Mode, it shoots a burst of up to 6 shots at a frame rate of 8 frames per second.  That's faster than most, if not all, the cameras I looked at in this price range.  Meanwhile, entry level DSLR cameras are considerably more expensive and typically have frame rates of only 3 fps.So far, the results are amazing.  Outdoors, it captures the action beautifully with no blur at all.  Basketball games indoors are a bit tougher due to the lower light but I've managed to get quite a few nice shots (btw, most cameras would be challenged trying to catch fast action in low light with no flash).  And I love the 6 frames in 3/4 of a second burst in Sports Mode.  Truth is, after 3/4 of a second, the action that was going on when you pressed the shutter release button is now over.  I know some pros shoot one shot at a time but I much prefer a burst of shots.  During a fast moving game, it's pretty amazing how much can happen from 1/8 of a second to the next.Frankly, I can't think of a camera I'd rather have.", "Date": "June 24, 2013"}, {"Title": "Great Camera", "Author": "Richard A.

Bluing", "ReviewID": "R2RE46UR08LF7", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I purchased the Nikon COOLPIX L820 after looking at several other digital cameras in the same price range.  Hands down the Nikon offered more features and value for the dollar and was the driving force behind my decision to purchase the item.  I took the camera with me on vacation and the pictures that I took with the Nikon were outstanding!  Excellent color and clarity along with a wide range of special effect features made using this camera a treat.  I have excellent pictures of all of my vacation spots and special moments along with clear, crisp movies that I will cherish for years to come.  The only downside to the camera that I noted was the ability to take still pics in low light of items in motion.  There's a function that works very well in the daylight but in low light the camera comes up a bit short.  Still photos in low light are extremely sharp and the camera seems to adjust very well to low light conditions. Panorama Mode offers the user the opportunity to capture 180 degree or 360 degree photos - excellent for taking large wide angle shots of your favorite spots. The digital zoom is top notch (to a point then granulation occurs) and the 3D mode seemed to work well.  Better 3D quality is offered with more expensive cameras, the Nikon didn't offer the depth of field that is available with high end cameras. Using a high end Micro SD memory card with this unit is a must.  Slow memory will impact your ability to quickly write photos and movies taken with the camera. A good SD card with lots of space will cost $20-$50 depending n the size and speed selected. Battery life was great, the camera uses 4 AA batteries - I took over 1500 shots (including video) before having to change the \"cheap-O\" batteries that came with the camera.  I've yet to exhaust my 2nd set of batteries.  Overall this is one nice camera for the price.

I realized that for under $200 I was probably going to find some things I didn't like. Taking this out of the box I liked that it was small and lightweight which I liked. The first thing I found that I didn't like was that the battery compartment door was flimsy and hard to close when the batteries were in. Tried taking some photos inside with light from windows and lamps without the flash and I was not satisfied with those. Nothing in focus. When the flash is used the photos are nice but there are some times when you can't use a flash.  I'll admit I am not a camera expert but I expected better. Went outside and results were much better. Zoom worked great and photos were crisp and clear. On about the fourth day of having this camera the shutter release stopped working. The camera came on, all the display icons were there, and when I depressed the shutter to focus I could see that was working too. It just would go no further to actually take the photo. There was no error message on the display either. Tried turning it off and back on a few times and still no photo. Went on the web to find a solution and couldn't find anything.

I bought it as a replacement after my son got a hold of our Nikon Coolpix S8100 and broke the lens.  I was super excited to get the L820 and move \"up\" in quality a bit, and I'm feeling a little heartbroken that I am probably going to be returning it.  I'm not a professional by any means, so these are just my amateur observations after using it for the last week.The good:-- The zoom is great, and the image stabilization really works!  I don't have the steadiest hand, yet I was able to take several pictures of things in my garden at full zoom without any blurring.-- The image quality is very nice for outdoor shots in general.-- I don't notice any delay between pressing the button and the picture being taken, and there isn't a long delay between pictures.-- Has some fun features, like color filtering... which is kind of useless really, but is neat.-- Exposure is easy to adjust.-- Flash is easy to disable or enable.The bad:-- Indoor pictures of my toddler still require flash or they come out blurry, there's no way I can find to get around that. The ratings for good low light pics without flash was one reason I bought the camera.  Unfortunately, unless the subject is holding still, it won't work well.  Maybe this is something all digital cameras are bad with, I'm not sure.  But since my main desire is for a camera to take good indoor pictures of my always-moving child and I'd like to avoid the washed-out look and shadows from the flash, this isn't great.-- Indoor pictures WITH the flash on still sometimes come out blurry if my son is moving around.-- The \"sports\" mode is not good for indoor lighting.  I haven't tried it outdoors, but indoors the pics are blurry, and it takes a few seconds before you can take another picture, even if you're not in \"continuous\" mode.-- The camera does not come with a memory card.  The internal memory holds 19 pictures of the pre-set size, that's it.  So you HAVE to buy a separate memory card for this camera if you plan to take more than 19 pics or want to do videos.-- The size of the camera is kind of a pain.  The step up in size from a more typical point and shoot is substantial, and I've found this isn't a camera I feel like taking places with me.  We went for a short hike with the kiddo yesterday, and I didn't take the camera because it is just too bulky.  If it fit my other needs I'd try to get around the size issue, but it would still annoy me.Comparing this camera to my Coolpix S8100, I would say the overall image quality is significantly better, especially outdoors.  The L820 doesn't seem to have the \"subject tracking\" mode that the S8100 did, which is a bummer because that was the way I got the best pictures of my little ball of energy.  If I were budgeted to have two separate cameras around this price range, I would keep this one for at home outdoor use and for scenic pictures, and get a smaller camera with less zoom and better settings for indoor/motion pictures to use as my everyday camera.So... back this camera goes, and back to the drawing board I go.", "Date": "September 2, 2013"}, {"Title": "Feature rich camera that takes excellent pictures", "Author": "Raymond W Goyette", "ReviewID": "R1PFTXYSHIPB7M", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "The camera takes standard AA batteries making it very easy to keep spares on hand.

Can trap the lens inside the camera and if you accidently turn on the camera with the lens cap on, the motor will grind and grunt and I am pretty sure you can only do this a couple of times before the camera breaks down. MAJOR flaw. -2 stars. See customer image about this issue.2. Focussing is slow specially at telephoto shots. There is no little graphic which points to where in the frame the focus is targetted at. Seems like most cameras do this these days but not this camera.3. No external flash mount.4. AA batteries.

The L810 was the previous model and search for \"L810 lens cap\" on Google and you will see lot of people complaining about the lens mechanism getting broke.I expect a cheap camera to be everyday consumer friendly. The lens cap should have attached to the lens barel instead of the camera body like it is on the higher end P520 model.

The L820 is physically a small body SLR style with Point & Shoot guts. The 4 AA batteries are a nice touch as I have a bunch of eneloop batteries. The big rubberized grip makes this camera easy to hold. An extra zoom lever has been added to the side of the lens barrel which is nice when composing long range telephoto shots. Photographing birds is one of my main uses for this camera & it does the job very well. I have always been anti-scene modes and insisted on a camera with P, A, S, M modes. Maybe it's because I cut my teeth on a Pentax K1000 fully manual 35mm film camera. Well I threw caution to the wind and went with this fully automatic camera with modes like Easy Auto, Auto & Scene Mode. I was not disappointed. Technology has really gotten to the point that the camera can most often pick the right scene mode and settings by analyzing your image and assigning the proper shutter speed, aperture and ISO to give you a perfectly exposed photograph. I concentrate on framing the photo more now and composing the best shot leaving the exposure up to the camera. It is my guilty pleasure. When I want to fiddle with ISO, white balance and exposure compensation I can use auto mode. For under $200 I bought this camera and unknown to me the box came and it said \"L820 Kit\".

Just hold the play button and off u go. Note: Still, I recommend to take lens cover off since sometime u forget that u didn't take it off  and might hit the shutter ..like I did once :)3) battery life is an issue if u dont buy rechargable ones. You can take about 900 pics with 1 set of batteries,.4) By no means, am an avid photographer but the pics are clear, love the macro, smart smile and zoom.it might not work out for everyone but works for me.Overall I'm satisfied with the product and would recommend it.

I still adore film, and if I had my own dark room, I would go right back to film. The one downside to film photography is I only have 36 shots on average with my Vivitar, so I need to be VERY selective about what photos I take. With digital, I can take several photos of one thing or scene from multiple angles, and delete any photos that I know won't look right when I upload them to my computer.I'm still figuring out all of the settings, but here are some of my favorites:1. Grayscale. Slightly crisper than B&W; film, but has fewer gradients, which makes it seem old-school.2. Sepia. This is great for portraits if you want to play with that style. Landscapes or any light sources will look dull with this setting, but that's how sepia is.3. Choose color. I can choose from many, many colors, and then snap photos that will be a monochrome of that color.4. Scene. Choosing a scene gets the camera ready to take a photo of a landscape, portrait, fireworks, and even for pets! There's quite a few scenes in there to choose from. I use the pet setting quite a bit for that cat of mine who never stays in one place!I have recorded videos and they come out great. It's nice for recording wild animals, pets, dances, etc, because everything looks really good, no blurs. It's a light weight camera too, so I can get steady videos.The flash has to be used for certain scenes, and it can be to powerful sometimes. There are times when I'm shooting a landscape and I need the flash, and even though I have the flash turned on, it barely goes off, and I get a dark photo. I usually have to resort to the portrait setting to solve that problem, or if I don't want a flash I go with landscape. Landscape is sort of like a default for picture taking, and it helps when I am photographing anything fast-paced, because other settings that are supposed to be for those scenes will get fussy if things are moving around too much. This camera will refuse to take a shot if it thinks that the shot won't come out good, even if I want it to be blurry or have low light. Keeping it on the landscape setting helps to avoid losing great shots to its stubbornness.I find the cover for the batteries and memory card a bit flimsy. It's hard to lift and place back on, so I do it extra careful because I am afraid of it breaking. Other than that, this is a very durable camera. It's a little awkward for me to have a camera that doesn't offer a way for me to unscrew the lens and screw on a larger one, like I would with my Vivitar. I think when it comes to changing parts, my Vivitar wins. I feel like my Nikon is more for moderately serious photography, but not a camera I would build a professional career on.", "Date": "December 26, 2013"}, {"Title": "First one was a lemon! Replacement works great!", "Author": "H.T.", "ReviewID": "R2LOH5ERCJKAMD", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "Ordered this camera and it was awful! It worked well out of the package ONCE, then the second time that I turned it on, it began freezing up while taking pictures and/or video. When it would freeze it would not turn off unless the batteries were removed. Then the lens would not retract. I tried several times to troubleshoot, including buying brand-new batteries, but nothing worked. After 3 days of attempting to use it, the display started to show vertical white lines while in video mode. I gave up and returned it to Amazon. I took a chance and ordered a second camera. The second one works perfectly fine so far. It has not frozen, no display issues, no problems with the lens retracting and no problems powering it on or off. So it looks like the first camera was simply a lemon!The camera takes good quality pictures. It is a bit large if you are planning to replace a compact point and shoot camera. You're not going to slide this in your pocket. However if you're using this in place of a DSLR, then you'll find it smaller and lighter in weight. I could actually stick this in purse for a day trip (not doable with my DSLR).I'm having some problems with the flash washing out skin tones in the auto mode, so I need to explore the settings. Clearly I'm not a skilled photographer so this is probably a user issue- just not something I've had issues with in other Nikons. Regardless, you can take amazing indoor shots with this camera without even using the flash!There are some design issues with this camera. The battery compartment is poorly designed. The cover can be difficult to close and every time you want to remove the memory card, you will have to fight with the batteries as well. Also the USB cable is much too short. (Hence the reason that I have to remove the memory card to load my photos.) These are both minor issues considering the quality of the end product. I'm not a fan of using AA batteries in a camera, but so far battery usages seems fair. Also, from a design perspective, the video record button is in an awkward place (it's easy to hit it unintentionally).Others have complained that you cannot turn the camera on to upload photos without removing the lens cap. This is not true. Transferring photos works fine with lens cap on.The manual is far too basic for this camera's capabilities. For example, it doesn't even mention how to take continuous shots. This was one of the main features that I wanted in the camera and once I found the setting I loved the results! Look forward to getting some outstanding action shots! Just don't rely on the manual to explain where all of the settings are that you want. I've used both Nikon and Fuji cameras, I have found this Nikon to be user friendly especially if you're already worked with other Nikon models.My overall opinion is that this camera is excellent for the price on Amazon. I have seen the same model vary in price by as much as $100. No one came close to Amazon's Thanksgiving sale price.

So far that seems the best but I haven't tried them all.  If you do buy this camera make sure try out all the settings.

I've had this for less than a wk, which I did the one-day shipping. I gave this camera a rating of 5 stars, because I like how sleek & stylish this is. I love the bright red color. I tested out a couple of the scene effects. Used the Easy Auto Mode, which is great. Took 1 video, which I used in continuous mode. The menu is easy to use. The battery compartment area/memory card is okay, I guess. I read a couple reviews of this camera about shutting the battery cover without damaging the batteries and memory card. The first time I put the 4 AA batteries (which are included) in & closed the battery cover, I had a little trouble but got it closed safely & carefully. The battery life is good. I like the comfort of holding the camera, especially with the black non-rubber area in the upper right corner on the back of the camera. This is my first DSLR -- Point & Shoot camera. I do have a Canon (My very own 1st camera) compact camera, which is nice, but wanted an updated & newer one. I just bought a camera case/bag designed for a dslr camera for under $20 at a store, which I would have bought one online, but didn't want to spend extra money on camera accessories. Overall, this is an excellent camera for those who are entry level dslr experience & want to take professional like photos.PROS: Stylish, Easy to Hold, Battery Life, 30x zoom, and the Red colorCONS: Couldn't think of any except maybe the Battery CoverI would recommend this camera to anyone who wants to show there talent as a photographer, even if you're a professional photographer, hobbyist, or amateur.", "Date": "April 24, 2014"}, {"Title": "Love, love, love this camera", "Author": "Amazon Customer", "ReviewID": "R1P9USXRYLGK3W", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I bought myself a Christmas present this year and I have been quite happy with it.

There is a terrific suite of photo editing and enhancement tools build into the camera.  The viewing screen is sharp, very \"color true\", and big enough to allow for a good preview of composed pictures.  There are so many features and capabilities on this camera that it I still haven't exhausted them all.  This is a little bit more camera than a simple point and shoot, but its complexities are easy to master with a little practice and open up many possibilities for creativity.  It's connectivity to other digital devices is good, but requires a cord to transfer pictures from internal memory (which is abundant) or from a memory card which is easy to install or remove.  It would be nice to have wifi/bluetooth connectivity with this camera, but I think that the range of capabilities outweighs this unless you are someone who likes to take a picture and immediately share.

I have always been a novice so all I need is an easy point-and-shoot camera with long zoom, takes good pics in the dark, burst for sports, and fast shutter speed. This camera supposedly had all. At first, I was pretty impressed with the quality of pics I took of my son at their school's Christmas concert. I was all the way back but the zoom was so good, it was like taking close-up pics of him & the stage decor. The pics looked sharp and gorgeous on the LCD....until I downloaded the pics on my laptop. What happened to the gorgeous pics? With my 17-inch screen (have new HP laptop), the pics are actually blurry, any little movement turned blurry, and I'm not talking about sports/running/fast action movement, I'm talking about turning head to the side, clapping hands, choreography for a moderate Christmas song (kids are on the bleachers singing). Thought maybe I wasn't holding the camera steady enough, but the entire frame was filled with kids & only 2 or so kids moving would be blurry. It's not my computer because I have other pics downloaded from our broken compact Nikon, Fuji waterproof & Olympus cameras as well.Took the camera on vacation, CMOS is supposed to take bright photos even without flash. Well, we were in a well-lit room (fluorescent), again the pics looked great on the LCD, and again, looked horrible blown up on the computer screen - pics were dark. And same as before, photos of the 6-yr was running around the 13-yr old, the 6-yr old was blurry, like wind moving. I also took pics with our very old Olympus tough camera (had both cameras with me) and there was no blur.PROS:~ good super zoom~ fast shutter~ easy to use, has all the different program settings which is perfect for novices like meCONS:~ pics look nice on LCD but are horrible when downloaded to computer~ flash is too bright most of the time...darkness turns to daylight, literally! (tried to take photo of Christmas tree lit up in the dark, pic looked like I had all lights in the room turned on & drowned the tree lights)~ 4 AA batteries lasted me 2 1/2 days.

I took a photo of the room at the other end of the house and the photo picked up the details of the FIBERS in the decorative floor carpet!!!  Blew me away.  Without flash!!  My last Sony would have choked on such a feat and it cost about 100 more.  Overall, quite pleased with the low-light features. Camera pops on and ready to shoot in quite good timing. That was my first concern as that was always a benefit of Sony -- the ability to see a random photo opp, grab the camera, turn it on and shoot immediately.  Canon chokes on that, so do a few others.  Sony DSC is master there, but this Nikon is quite impressive point-n-shoot ready.  And it's low-light is far superior to my Sony. I have two cameras with all the bells and whistles, because I thought *someday* I may finally learn how to use them. But to this day, they remain virtually untouched.  I finally got smart and got a camera that really has the very best of ONLY those features I need the most!Also - must say that the product picture does not do this camera justice in terms of color.

It takes crisp and rich-colored pictures with very low light conditions and relatively fast (that is, if you have at least 1/3 of a second for it to adapt to the light pressing softly the button). Pictures are taken relatively quickly and the built-in features (although all automatic) are very precise.Besides a panorama mode that can take 180\u00ba or 360\u00ba photos very easily (you decide), it has a very interesting mode (the \"pet\" mode) that lets you take a sequence of photos (about 3 per second in any resolution) and does a pretty good job in focusing the target (of course, it depends on the previous automatic adjustment of about a third of a second and how quick the target moves, or else it will be blurry).It's true about the lens cap... it's a minor issue if you don't have the precaution to take it off previous powering it on. The camera pops out its lens at power up and the cap doesn't just come off... it has a snap-on configuration that blocks the lens, so I don't know if this can damage the motor of the zoom-autofocus feature someday, but I guess that's something you have to get used to do before using the camera.Zooming is very nice (although the 30x isn't completely physical... the last third of the zooming is digital) and macro photos are also cute.The easy video feature (it can record up to 1080p with stereo sound) is also a plus on this camera. No selecting between modes, since they are independent with different buttons. Just take a picture, press the video button to record and pause-stop, and take another picture again. Really cool.Overall, it's an excellent camera for photo enthusiasts like myself without the hassle and price of more professional ones.

Upon first picking it up and looking it over in the store, I was impressed with the ease of operation.  Having owned and still own a Pentax ME Super, I find this camera to be of better quality and much better ease of use than the P & S one that I have kind of put in the shade for now.  They both have little idiosyncrasy's, as far as what works for you and what doesn't.  I am finding out that they all have the A and P settings and each has a little glitch, if you will, of what that entails.  I don't have any drawbacks on this L820. I have a little hard time with the battery cover, in that it takes a little extra effort to get the cover lock, in just the right place for it to pop open.  I'm afraid it will eventually snap off.  I love the fact that I don't have to worry about getting those high priced square boxed little battery's and now I just go and get 4 AA's.  Of course I get the best and don't skimp on that.  I haven't used the video transfer function yet, but hopefully in the near future.  Close ups seem to be a problem for me, in that it has two places for zoom control.  The one associated with the snap button, and the one on the lens. But as with time and practice and patience, I will learn.  I would think that including a dvd of how to use some features would be a great boon to some of us.  The usual features of a P & S camera are standard.  I haven't come across anything unusual as of yet, in as some tricks of the trade, but maybe down the line someone will.  For under $200 this is a great camera.

I have had absolutely NO problem hooking the camera up to my computer for one. It's extremely easy to get my pictures off the camera.Second, the lens cap issue is not an issue. If you leave the cap on and turn on the camera, it simply flashes a white screen saying \"lens error.\" All you have to do is turn it back off, take the lens cap off, turn it back on and you're good to go. I haven't had any grunting noises or trouble or anything and I have forgotten the lens cap on a few times.I DO struggle to get clear pictures when lots of movement is involved although I'm still playing with the settings.

The zoom is smooth, the controls are laid out well for easy access without looking at them, and if you don't look at the mislabeled directional button, the settings of the camera are extremely intuitive. It uses standard AA batteries, which are a costly option, but also mean that you can simply dump them out and put new in rather than waiting for it to charge - often critical, especially on vacations.But this is a point and shoot. If you are looking at point and shoot, you are most likely wanting to take pictures of the real world where you wait for the sunlight to be right, or you get children to hold still, or many other things that require the shot to be quick after you press the button. That's why you even have auto-focus, so you're not sitting there focusing.If you use the auto-focus, though, it will get blurry, then crisp, then blurry, then crisp, then wobble a bit, then get blurry and crisp again. If there's any light issue, it will also swing between light and dark between each blurry and crisp cycle. Then, several moments after pressing the button, it takes the picture, and most often after selecting one of the blurry, too dark, or washed out version rather than the perfectly crisp and well lighted option it seemed to have settled on just before. If you're trying to take family photos, such as Christmas morning, or taking nature photos where the sun has to shine through a break in the clouds, this lengthy delay means you missed your shot, even if you're lucky enough to have the auto-focus pick the right focus.Taking the auto-focus off for things like indoor macro shots or cooperative adults produced excellent images after a little tweaking.

I received it on Oct. 15. I really like the pictures it takes and the camera in red.I thought it was great for the money.  I think it takes very good pictures in low light.However, I am having a problem with the \"Movie Mode\".  Every other time when I go to \"Movie Mode\" it locks up and no buttons work.  The display still shows, but I have to open the battery cover and reset the camera. Sometimes it will record the full 29 minutes of video.  Then if I try it again, the camera will freeze up at 28min. and 53 seconds.  So it looks like there was 7 seconds of record time.  But it doesn't record anything.It allows 29 minutes of video at a time.  It counts down from 29 minutes. So at 28min. and 53 seconds it locks up. Every time it does this, I have to open the battery cover to reset the camera.  Then it may work, or may not work in \"Movie Mode\".Nikon said that since I initially used a \"Nikon non recommended\" SD card , the Transcend Class 10 32GB 18 MB/s, (The Transcend card was featured on Amazon as recommended to buy with the camera, so I bought it),  that I needed to get one of the 4 cards on their list of approved SD cards, one of which is Sandisk.So I bought a Sandisk High speed 32GB 45MB/s card from Amazon and I received it today very quickly.  It still does the same thing.  I recorded a video, stopped, and then tried it again and the camera locks up at 28 minutes and 53 seconds left to record and needs to be reset by opening the battery compartment.Nikon told me today after I received a supposedly \"Approved Card\" from Sandisk,,,,  that I damaged the camera by using the Transcend card in the first place.Again, The Transcend card was featured on Amazon as recommended to buy with the camera,so I bought it.Nikon says I have to return the camera to them for repair.  What kind of BS is this?My fear is that they will try to charge me for something that I should never have caused a problem in the first place.I suppose I have been lucky, but, I have never had this kind of problem before with products that I have bought from reputable companies.I did not!! think I would get a problem like this from Nikon.I wish Amazon would take it back.  They have been so good.I see several other reputable Vendors that recommend Transcend SD cards and also some other brands that are not on Nikons list as well with this camera.Has anyone else had this problem?  I am not happy!!  I don't want to send it to Nikon before Xmas.I see several other reputable Vendors that recommend Transcend SD cards and also some other brands that are not on Nikons list as well for this camera.UPDATE 5/1/2014:I sent the Red camera back to Nikon NY.  They didn't do anything to address the freeze up in Movie mode. They said that they cleaned things and sent it back to me.  It locked up the second time I tried movie mode. Now I am really pissed.Meanwhile, I bought a \"refurbished\" Plum camera from Adorama and a new Sandisk class 10 SD card.  It works perfectly with all the SD cards that I have.  No lock up which requires the battery compartment to be opened to reset the camera.So I went back to Nikon and they had me send it to Precision camera in Connecticut.  I also sent the new SD card and batteries.After being \"In repair\" for a week,  they sent it back to me saying they they cleaned all contacts, Complete Repair and return all functions to factory specs, Firmware download, corrections and adjustments, Address values and adjusted.Nothing about the Movie Mode issue.The camera froze up the second time I tried Movie mode.  I guess they just threw away the letter I included describing the PROBLEM!!I CAN NOT BELIEVE THIS CRAP FROM NIKON!At least they didn't lose my SD card and batteries.The camera froze up on the second try at \"movie mode\".

A pity that it won't take the f1.2 lens from my 35mm film Nikons :-DSo: reasonable value/money for what is basically a \"point-and-shoot\" camera - but a slightly costly lesson for me: I should have thought a little more about what I wanted/expected before clicking \"Buy Now\"!", "Date": "November 28, 2013"}, {"Title": "Great camera!

It is intuitive and well laid out.  It's purpose is to be an automatic camera that takes great photos quickly and easily, in most situations.It's not for professional photographers by any means, but as a practical tool for general business and life, and for taking excellent photos quickly - it is unbeatable in this price range, as of this writing.  The 30x optical zoom is definitely cool and useful (yes, there are cameras with more zoom but this is plenty for many situations).  The lens can focus extremely close on zoom even from a working space distance away from the object (there are settings to monitor this on the view screen-see Using Macro Mode in manual).  I love this camera's ability to take close ups - close enough for most needs, after all, it's not a microscope.The lens movement is smooth (motor action) and has a great quality feel (all focusing is automatic; there is no manual focusing).  The auto focus is fast and sure.  Pictures snap quickly.  This camera has several continuous multi-shot shooting settings.  The L820 has plenty of scene shooting modes (e.g. night portrait, night landscape, snow) that are selected through the on-screen menu (not a touch screen menu).  The macro mode can be activated through a dedicated button that takes you to an On-Off screen that you have to select (by button presses) to enter the macro mode.  Again, the camera is intuitive, though reading the manual definitely helps to learn the camera's operation, the extent of options, and the limitations (such as which functions cannot be used simultaneously).This 16MP camera takes excellent photos; clear, sharp, and with good color.  I have absolutely no complaints about the picture quality.  (Note:  I don't have any complaints about this camera at all.)The thing I like most about the camera is the view screen; a small clear TV screen with plenty of on-screen data.  High sunlight does wash out the image so there are times you may have to cover the screen with your hand.  However, I should also note that I find this camera very easy to handle and manipulate.  It is comfortable.  (I use a small binder clip to help keep the lens cap attached to the camera strap and out of the way of the lens when taking pictures.)  One more thing about this TV screen: it does not articulate - it's a flat screen and does not open to give you flexibility in easy viewing when the positioning of the camera (to get the shot) is contorting or won't allow for direct visual contact (such as when holding the camera above your head with arm extended, in a crowd).  Personally, I can live with that, or rather, without it.Other points: At first glance, this camera has that Nikon professional look (like yeah, I watch NCIS - and those of you who watch also, know what I mean).  The L820 has the same Nikon QUALITY.  But, save for some shooting options, it is automatic and does not provide much in manual settings.  I say 'so what.'  The automatic focusing is extremely good, if not excellent.  Photos are spectacular for most people's needs.  And I would ask, 'exactly how much better can one do, in making the perfect setting, than this camera can do in capturing most, if not all, photos that a non-professional photographer would take.  If you want more, pay more.Lastly, I still want to have a smaller point & shoot camera that will fit into my pocket for reasons of portability and convenience.  This Nikon camera does not do that - It's too bulky for a pants pocket and I am sure too much mass for purses.But, for basic business, home, and general use, and ...to enjoy a great camera without too many confusing, time-consuming, or 'makes-no-difference' fine-tuning options, and ...to satisfy that NCIS desire to have a professional-looking Nikon (without paying the price), even if only for a fleeting peek and approval by casual onlookers,then this camera is a no-regrets buy.", "Date": "May 25, 2014"}, {"Title": "Great Purchase", "Author": "barbara mason", "ReviewID": "R188IN4NITXOVK", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "Great  choice for a camera.

The Nikon L820 is, in my opinion, the best camera for the money. With 16MP and a 30x optical zoom lense it is unmatched. I have been educating myself on cameras and photography for years and now knowing what I do, I can tell you that any person novice or pro will like this camera. It has great features and shooting modes which come in handy for helping you to get the best picture you can, but if you want you can manually do everything! The pictures are extremely crisp and vivid. The movies are breath taking. Perfect for out door shooting on the account the zoom lense can get you close to wildlife. Also the panorama setting helps with taking amazing landscapes. Nikon has come out with a slightly updated version of this camera (L830) that is the same, except the zoom, which is 34x.

I have been a Nikon user for many years specifically the D-series and had expectations about some basic features that I am used to.  The Menu is rudimentary with no customizations available and you cannot turn on the camera (or connect it with USB) without removing the lens cap.  You cannot even play your files without removing the lens.  Not sure which genius at Nikon thought about this as not being an inconvenience to the user!  Lastly the pictures are all in JPEG and I am used to taking pictures in RAW for editing using Nikon's customer software, but that is a moot point.  Beyond the gripes here, the camera is good for quick pictures and videos, especially on trips where I do not bring along the D-series with the various lenses.

It also comes with a case and neck strap which is very nice.I was surprised to see that it actually used batteries instead of a rechargeable one like my old digital cameras (I used to own the \"normal\" looking unfancy cameras, but they broke very easily!). However, I read somewhere that this is b/c it was originally designed for travelers - and that many times they do not have time to recharge a battery or would not have an extra rechargeable battery handy. In some cases European hotels would not have a compatible outlet or extra outlets to recharge a battery. Therefore, it would be easy to stop just about anywhere and pick up batteries to use in the camera. That is all fine and dandy, but I am just a normal mom who doesn't travel much but I do plan on investing in a battery re-charger to cut down on battery cost.

I wanted a camera that was easy to use with good results, affordability was a definite factor and since I occasionally sell items on the net, I wanted more color clarity with reds, blues and purples looking more like their true colors than what I was getting with my old camera.  With this camera, I can get true likeness of these difficult colors  with less tweaking and manipulation.  This camera has so many features, I am still learning and probably will not even use everything it has to offer. At this time, there is a lot of info you can read about this camera if you do a search and so far it lives up to my expectations.  It's easy to use with automatic settings.  It has a great flash and for more advanced photographers you have manual control as well. Having my family photos look so good with so much clarity makes me feel like a pro!  No grainy look here!  The vivid color and ease of use for the price of this camera is very satisfying.  I tried the video and no complaints with clear sound and video.

I don't think anyone will go wrong with this camera, beginner or professional. The lens cover can be attached to the strap so no losing it.

I was on the fence as reviews were mixed, but it did not disappoint. To be fair, I have only used it at one concert so far...more to come. I did read the instructions on the cd enclosed in the box and played with the different settings for a week or so. I discovered that the best setting for low light action shots (concerts) was the \"AUTO\" setting with a high ISO setting. This setting seemed to take better pictures that the sports setting under those circumstances.I am not a very experienced photographer, but I have learned to avoid taking the pictures using the \"telephoto\" or \"zoom\" option as those  were the only concert photos that came out blurry....it's impossible to hold the camera perfectly still (I do not have a tripod, and most concert venues will not allow them). The best way to achieve a closeup was to take the picture without zoom and edit it later on the computer.Overall for the price, I am very happy with the camera. I agree with some reviewers that a viewfinder would be nice for very sunny days, and you do have to remember to remove the lens cap before turning the camera on, but these are only minor hassles to me.", "Date": "October 4, 2013"}, {"Title": "Best Digital Camera we have EVER had!", "Author": "K.

This camera is perfect if you are looking for a good quality camera, but don't want to pay the price of a DSLR.  Other people have said that in easy auto mode the camera blurs the picture, the reason for this is mostly likely they weren't steady when they took the pictures.  Also, if your target is moving it may blur a bit, but it doesn't happen as often if the camera is steady.  I almost always forget to use the motion feature when taking pictures of moving objects.  It takes a bit of getting used to, but I recommend getting a beginning photography book that shows the correct positions to take pictures, and it will most likely also show you how to adjust your cameras features in regards to what lighting you are working with, and also what kind of picture you are trying to take.  This camera does have the ability to change the ISO similar to the DSLR.  It also has a manual raised flash, which is definitely a nice feature..  I didn't see it shown anywhere in the pictures when researching this camera.  This camera also has the ability to take 3D pictures though I haven't used this feature yet.  I also have not used the video yet.  So far this camera hasn't disappointed, so I'm sure it will good as well.  It is true what people say about the lens cover in the respect that if it's on and you forget and turn the camera on it's probably not good.  I've done it a few times.  It's not a reason I wouldn't recommend this camera. Its just something to be aware of.  Overall, the quality of the pictures is excellent for this type of camera and when using the zoom it also takes good quality pictures.

I knew I couldn't pay the $400+ that the SLR cameras cost, so after doing a lot of research on basic cameras, this seemed like it had a lot to offer and had good ratings by most.  I'm just a basic camera user, looking for a camera to take kid and family pictures.  It has a nice heft to it, and takes great basic pictures.  It doesn't have a viewfinder, but most other cameras in this price point don't as well.  You do have to remember to take the lens cap off before powering up the camera.  Takes very nice automatic pictures and the other picture settings were very easy to navigate and use.  The time between pictures is fairly quick and better than my old camera.  The only reason I am giving this four stars, is I haven't yet figured out how to take continuous shots of my kids.  I have the hardest time getting a good picture of my four year old, and to get all three of my kids to actually look at the camera at the same time is next to impossible.  I was hoping a continuous shot feature (don't even know if that's what you call it) would help me, but I haven't found this feature with some basic playing around.  I haven't read the manual yet, so I might be able to make this happen (I'm hoping).  I just haven't figured it out yet.

I have tried taking pictures on all the different settings and nothing seems to help. My old $100 Canon point and shoot would capture better pictures when kids were moving. I'm not asking for perfection, but shouldn't the camera be able to capture my son or daughter running without them looking like a smoky cloud is around them?

I'm not a complete novice when it comes to electronics, so I'm feeling frustrated that this is happening. I want to like the camera.

Auto focus is amazing, even at the most magnification!  It's just wonderfully simple to operate and our pics come out amazing from the camera shop printer.

Just got my camera today wooooohoooooo!The one thing that disappointed me so far (but is in a way my fault), it didn't come with a memory card and I thought it did. I have one ordered, but it didn't come today. It did come with 4 alkaline batteries that are NOT rechargeable, they say they are for trial use; but I also ordered 4 re-chargeable batteries with  a charger. Got them today as well; so as soon as I get my memory card I will be all set to snap away!  B004RP2VNI  (Recommended by a another reviewer)I ordered the red camera and it is G*O*R*G*E*O*U*S! I normally don't like red, but didn't want black; glad I chose this color, it is perfect, almost a candy apple red car color LOL!It's not much heavier than the smaller Kodak camera I had (with a lot less features!), and I like how it feels in my hands; also love how the flash can be raised and lowered, that makes it more like the old cameras we used to have before digital :) Don't have to scroll through stuff to turn it on or off.For the reviewer that said the lens cover hooks onto the lens....NO it does not! It attaches to the inside of the area surrounding the lens, but yes you do have to remove it before turning it on. This doesn't bother me in the least, I'm glad for the protection! But I'm not going to risk messing it up by trying it out to see if it actually does grind if it's on when I turn on the camera. Not to say some time I might forget to remove it, because yes that did happen with an older camera I had. But with it; the cap did attach to the lens, so when I turned it on, it automatically popped the cap off; so no biggie!The manual says to attach the lens cover to the neck strap, but if you don't want to use it, you can attach it to the camera itself; whichever you choose for yourself. I am also waiting for screen protector covers, I don't want to scratch my view screen. I accidentally took a pic trying to figure it out, but will update as soon as I try it out for real. B00D64K3KY****UPDATE:****I still haven't gotten my memory card yet, it might be in my mail box as I type this, but I just wanted to say I AM IN LOVE WITH THIS CAMERA! It is sleek, bright and shiny and I love how it handles!I have been taking a few pictures with the internal memory and they have all turned out A*W*E*S*O*M*E*! This is almost a \"just point and shoot\" camera. You gently hold the button down until it focuses (in a very few seconds) then push and it takes the picture before you know it, it's amazing! And it's very worth waiting those few seconds to focus.I took 3 pictures of the sky the other day and they turned out awesome, the great thing about it was.....I didn't have to use the zoom at all, and they looked like I could touch the clouds! With my old camera I had to zoom it all the way, then they looked blurry and not very crisp or clear. Also when you are focusing, you can move the camera back and forth until you get the perfect focus, with my old camera; I had to let go of the button, go back or forth, then hold the button again; and I lost the focus every time I had to do this. If I was trying to get a pic of say...my dog, she would have moved before I got it to focus and I lost the shot. Not with this baby, you'll get your picture before you realize you've pushed the button, I've actually suprised myself by \"accidentally\" pushing the button before I was completely ready, but the shot was still in focus and looked great LOL!As I said in the first review the manual says to attach the lens cord to the camera strap, I did that and every time I tried to use it, the lens flopped in my way banging the side of the camera; so I first attach the lens cord to the left side of the camera, then put the camera strap through the lens cord and all is well. The lens cap will dangle of course, but it is no longer in my way and doesn't bang on the camera.I make Cards For Soldiers (CFS) and they get sent to our soldiers overseas to send home to family and friends. I have taken pictures of some of the cards, and they look so great, I am just astounded at how this camera captures the images! With my old camera I had a terrible time trying to get a decent image of a card, no matter how I tried to focus, close up or at a distance, it just didn't do my cards justice. And especially with white, it would shine and you couldn't see the image because of the brightness of the card. I can lay my cards down; hold this camera right above it and just move it until I get it in focus and snap; the image is perfect. I wish I could post the pics for you to see. If anyone knows how I can, please let me know; I would love to be able to show what I'm talking about.** The only thing so far that I found that I really don't care for is the little \"door\" where you plug your usb cable into. I'm afraid if I use it very much it will break off, and that will make me very angry! I think Nikon should have had a better idea for that. It slides out, then lifts up, but it has 2 small hinges that are not very flexible, it barely opens far enough to plug in the cord. You have to be very gentle with it; or it definitely would break easily.Ok, that is all for this review, I will update again when I get my memory card and actually get to go picture taking of the scenery etc.", "Date": "August 13, 2013"}, {"Title": "Great Camera", "Author": "Fire Lady", "ReviewID": "R370N9FLI3Z90L", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "Purchased this camera before taking a trip from Nashville, TN to Montana, Wyoming, South Dakota, and North Dakota for 10 days.

Unfortunately, I do not. I got the camera 4 days ago because I wanted something that could capture my kids' funny moments... them playing, eating, sleeping, etc. without requiring too much setup or time. I had been using my iphone and Sony digital camera but the photos often looked blurry. Kids move quickly and I wanted a camera that could keep up. The Nikon Coolpix L820 has a fairly nice auto setting and approximately 12 presets (night, portrait, pets, sports, etc.)However, I found that none of the presets, including sports, could keep up with my kids. The photos always looked blurry. Manual mode seemed to work best but I always ended up with red eyes and blurred arms. I really wanted to love this camera but sadly, the pictures just aren't that great.There are some good things I should mention...1. The zoom IS very good2. This camera has a decent auto setting, which is nice if you're planning to shoot objects that don't move.Now, here's the bad things.1. Photos of moving people come out blurry no matter what setting I chose.2. All of my \"kid\" photos have red eyes and weird shadows.3.

If you are reading this here, then please go ahead and purchase from Amazon.WHY I WILL NEVER PURCHASE ANYTHING FROM NIKON AGAINWhy?  The most bogus return policy I have ever heard of.  It must be returned within 14 days of receipt, and it has to be unopened....I bought this camera from Nikon as a Christmas present for my fiancee.  I thought I was being good, and shopped MORE THAN TWO WEEKS before Christmas.  She knows photography, and I don't.  I thought this camera would let her do what she wanted.  It turns out it has absolutely 0 manual settings, so you can't adjust the aperture or the frame rate or anything, you can just flip through a bunch of predetermined settings.  This is not what she wanted, but we opened it to see if there was ANY manual setting change that would let her accomplish what she wanted (there wasn't).So, we wanted to return it and pay the difference in exchange for a D3200 which DOES allow manual adjustment of, you know, settings a photographer would want control over?0 help.  \"We have a very strict return policy.\"  Now I have a $250 camera that is a glorified smart-phone camera.  Lovely.How do you expect anyone purchasing something for Christmas any time before December, and to fall into this strict return policy?  It's ridiculous.  I asked to speak to a manager, and once more, verbatim, \"We have a very strict return policy\".The answer is simple, I won't be buying Nikon products again.If you are a photographer and know EXACTLY what you want, power to you and go ahead and shop from Nikon.  If you are purchasing for anyone else, and are not confident in exactly what a camera does and does not allow you to do, save yourself the trouble and DON'T BUY FROM NIKON.", "Date": "December 23, 2013"}, {"Title": "My camera Stinks!", "Author": "Legba Bogui", "ReviewID": "R37ZIEUF0GQDYV", "Overall": "2.0", "Content": "From the first minute with this camera I noticed it was terrible. I've got a Canon SX160 and 500 sitting right next to me, both of these cameras blow this one out of the water.Let me start by saying I think mine is defective. The zoom just will not focus, at all. If I want the zoom to focus I have to retract it all the way and zoom in again, and again, and again. If I'm lucky it will eventually focus on what I want - but only if I'm incredibly lucky.I thought it was something I was doing at first, but after testing some of my travel zooms at different zoom lengths, realized something is wrong with the Nikon. Even my compact elph will focus better than this thing.I played with a friends 810 a few weeks ago and really liked it, so, decided to get the 2013 model. What a giant disappointment.Within one day the camera malfunctioned twice. The first time the zoom just started sliding in and out non stop and the camera went berserk. I couldn't turn it off if I hit the power, but had to open the battery compartment while it was going crazy. Then, just this morning, I saw this really cool centipede/caterpillar/spider mutation thing. It was giant. I thought, \"oh nice, I'll grab my 820 and take a really sweet close up from far away.\" Wrong. The damn zoom wouldn't focus at anything over 10x. I spent about 5 minutes standing around 10 meters away from my shot fiddling with the camera while the bug waited patiently. Then the camera goes berserk again. The \"scene\" function turned on and frantically started switching between all the modes. Again, I couldn't turn the camera off and had to open the battery compartment in order to stop the madness. Finally, I gave up, grabbed another zoom, and took a great photo. The camera has also \"frozen\" a few times while taking photos. It just locks up.There is one other thing I managed to notice in just two days. I'm not even going to go into the fact that something in the lens housing rattles if you move or slightly shake the camera, or the incredibly cheap plastic body (I don't mind a plastic body on a camera at all, it's the fact that this plastic body really seems like cheap plastic - dollar store toy plastic). The weird noises coming from this camera are stupefying me. I have six different cameras, two travel zooms, compacts, and a dslr - so I realize cameras make noises while working, but I've never in my life heard something like this. If you put the camera up to your ear there is this loud squealing noise. It's like running your nails down a clean window or maybe the chalkboard. It does not sound right at all - it definitely doesn't sound like something you would hear from a camera while it's processing.Bottom line: This model might be a defect. I will be exchanging it for another one, and if that one is in top notch working condition, I will retract my review and give stars where stars are due. Don't get me wrong, I really like the design of this camera. I've played around with a buddy's 810, loved how it felt and the shots it took, so thought the upgraded CMOS in the newer model will really knock me out. It did knock me out - in awe of how crappy it is. I don't even mind the housing it sits in, as long as the exchanged one works properly I will be keeping it. But what does this tell you about Nikon quality control? If I look where my other cameras are made - all Canon and Sony - all but one say \"Japan.\" One is made in Malaysia. The Nikon 820 is made in Indonesia. I don't know much about quality control, or if it matters whether it's Japan or China or Mexico, but I know enough to say that there was very little control of any type on my model, let alone any quality.Update 05/01/2013:So the squealing noise was gone. And that was the only thing. The lens still rattled. OK, I can live with that. What I can't live with is the zoom. Just a simple test I did: The 820 in dimming light conditions, on a table, with an object about 20 meters away. Very, very slowly zooming in and getting the shot perfectly in frame, the zoom just right (high iso wide aperture etc etc). Then comes the focus... Oh yes the focus... Once, waiting - out of focus. Twice, waiting - out of focus. Thrice, waiting - out of focus. Itching to get the shot and all I see is a big blob. Let's try auto. Nope. Let's try 10m. I had to focus three times, but finally, we've got focus, time for a shot! Enough, no shot opportunity at 200mm this time, time for a video test: Video on, same lighting conditions, zooming in on my object. This camera took 36 seconds to focus. Yes, I timed it. Is this normal? because I've never experienced something like this. When I put a comparable camera to the same video test, maybe 4 seconds - and that's being generous. So go my hopes of an ergonomic and compact travel zoom. Another bright day shooter? Definitely. The giant FZ200 will suffice for now.Needless to say, I took the second 820 back after a week... and got a P520. Just couldn't help myself. Never owned a Nikon before the L series, maybe both were a dud. Guess what? Same exact crap! At stills the P520 is much better and will focus at 600+mm! (albeit very slowly - whoops, there goes the warbler!) but the video on that thing is the same way. It literally takes minutes to focus. Forget the shutter for a moment, the video tells me enough. What is up with these lenses? Do a test and put something dark on an all white background. Now stand back, zoom in, and focus. I am upgrading my L820 review from one star to two. The second model I received did not squeal (as loud), and didn't go haywire. But the zoom problems are still apparent in both the L and P series \"flagshit\" mega-zooms, brought to you straight from quality control Nikon plants.

It is a great point and click camera whose pictures turn out really great without having to put a lot of effort into them. That's the way that I prefer it. My spouse on the other hand has a better grip on the advanced features so she can make the camera do some things that I don't know how like motion blurring, time spanning where the object starts at one place and ends in another, and just some strange things that I don't know how to do. I'm not sure about my names, blurring, spanning, hopefully you kind of understand what I'm trying to say. I apologize for my limited photography vocabulary.The camera also takes amazing videos. Full 1080p HD that look almost like a professional Hollywood production company stopped by and set up shop at our family get togethers!

It's a very nice, rich burgundy color, with parts of it being black. Very pretty, and has a nice weight to it. NOT a pocket camera, it feels more like one of the old 35mm cameras, but lighter.The zoom function is a bit slow to focus, and goes in and out of focus more than I'd like, and there is a definite pause between pressing the shutter release and the picture actually being taken, but most of the time it catches the correct image.  This is NOT a 30x zoom; if you zoom in most or all the way, your image will be VERY fuzzy.  If you zoom tightly while videoing, you will lose focus several times while the camera \"finds\" its focal point, and you can hear the hum of the lense moving on the video.  The lense cap is not attached to the camera, and if you try to turn it on with the cap on, you get a \"Lense Cap Error\" message, and have to turn the camera off and back on after removing the cap. That's a pain, and I can easily imagine the cap getting lost the first time I take the camera anywhere.  It should have a loop that attaches to the wrist strap or something. Those are the only negatives I've found so far.It takes a few sessions to get comfortable with the camera, but once you do, you'll be able to get beautiful, crisp images with excellent color.  There are some great macros; I especially like the one for photographing flowers.  There are also some filters you can use on your photos, but IMO, they're useless. The Panoramic function works very nicely; you have your choice of 180\u00b0 or 360\u00b0, and a slider in the viewport guides your speed. You'll need a memory card; Amazon has some good ones for good prices.If you're tired of using your phone to take pics and vids, and want something that'll give you really nice photos and good videos, this is a great camera to go with.

The slightest movement ruins the picture.  I've never had a camera that seemed to be time lapsed in every shot.  I've tried every setting there is, but nothing seems to help.

If you have a tripod mount on the camera you cannot open the battery door/sd card bay. If you work with a tripod a lot this becomes extremely cumbersome. The camera does not come with an AC adapter and thought the ac adapter would be only 5v you cannot power the camera through the included USB cable. I usually do product photography with a light box and continuous lights so it's lack of a hot shoe was not an issue. The camera also works without horizontal banding under florescent lights (some don't). The camera is a point-and-shoot but has some cool semi-manual settings.I usually expect to get a SD-card and an AC adapter with my camera. The ac adapter is like $45. Also, the camera has HDMI out but requires a micro hdmi cable or something that it again does not come with.Again though the camera takes really good photos with minimal fuss. It's just missing the little things (like all of them).Update: I ended up returning the camera. It's lack of an adaptor burned through all my batteries while taking product photos. Then nearly complete on a new project I opened the door that the sd card and batteries share and dropped a battery and lost it under some equipment I couldn't move. So I had to end up using my old camera to finish the job. After going back to it I just felt that it  was a much better workflow and I am going to look for a camera more similar to that one. It's just a pain to need to take the tripod mount off to get into the sd card/battery bay. If I was taking nature walks or taking a bunch of pics on vacation or something this would be a great camera for me.Even though I'm returning the camera I'm going to give it another star because it has seriously amazing zoom. I have bought lenses that don't have this much zoom that cost more than this camera.If you need to get to the SD card a lot and you use a tripod it just doesn't work. If you don't need that you'll be hard pressed to find a better camera in it's price range.

Sagaberd", "ReviewID": "R2Z4L3W6WG17Z1", "Overall": "1.0", "Content": "I have no idea where to start about this poor excuse of a product.How about I start with a list of physical and operational defects:1) The rubber thumb cushion pad near the record button was already falling off.2) Another rubber part, the hand grip below the shutter button was not completely attached.3) The Self-timer/AF-Assistant lamp didn't work.4)  The flash could not be raised/opened.5)  ***There was a partial finger print on the INSIDE of the lens. Couldn't be removed.****I thought Nikon made quality products.  I cannot think of any plausible reason why this unit should have been allowed out of the factory.I spent several days researching for a replacement to a Canon SX10 that was destroyed in an accident.  I order this Nikon model over another Canon model because of the 30x optical zoom.  I also ordered so as to use at a historic family function this past weekend.Now I'll go into the critical flaws I found in this device.I soon realized the flash would no deploy, so I took a tripod on the trip figuring I could work around this seeing how I didn't have a choice at this point.  However, every time I would depress the shutter button I would get a \"RAISE THE FLASH\" warning.  This even happened outside in the bright sunlight.  Now when I decide I do not want to use a flash for a picture that is what I expect the camera to do.  I do not want it to tell me I am wrong or force me to use it's suggestion.  The firmware is suppose to assist you, and not dictate what it thinks is correct.Next I found the extending and retracting of the lens was extremely noisy.  People within 10 feet of me were asking what was wrong with my camera.  Between the noise of the zoom and the whirring noise of the auto-focus This problem completely obliterated the audio of a five minute video I took.The auto focus didn't use the center of the lens as described on page 28 of the users manual.  Reference number 24 on page 8 of the manual shows a double bracket [  ] that depicts where the focus point is.  Instead I found the focus point was about half-way from center to the right side and about 1/3 the distance from center to top.(Diagonally up to the right)  So I again adjusted my actions trying to accommodate another problem.  I would shift the focus point and depress the shutter button half-way to lock the focus and exposure, reported by a beep, then I would re-frame my shot.  However every time I heard the beep and started to move the camera the exposure and focus would change while holding the shutter button partially depressed.  At the top of page 29 in the users manual its says that should not happen.  A relative pointed out that the AF-Assist lamp wasn't working, but that doesn't explain why it was focusing away from the center of the frame.In the approximately 72 hours I used the camera at this historic family event I took 417 pictures. Out of that I i would say I have only 31(7.43%) that are usable or worth saving.  My mother got better results from her four year old 1.1 MP LG flip phone.I'm not a novice and I am certainly by no means a professional photographer; however, this camera was a complete and utter disaster.  I may get my purchase price refunded to me.  I wasted a lot of time and effort trying to work around these problems, but that pales in comparison to the family history and once in a lifetime images I failed to capture.All I can say right now is disappointment would be an extremely grotesque understatement.", "Date": "December 9, 2013"}, {"Title": "memory card not included", "Author": "Stephenie L.

I made several videos with it as well as some stills, all on the set of AA batteries of AA batteries that came with it. It worked great.Yesterday I took it out of its case, loaded new batteries and tried to shoot video. It immediately started eating batteries. A brand new set of batteries only lasted about 15 seconds then the camera shut down. You can watch the battery power drop as it goes. Then I figured out that the batteries that came with it, though they say they are Alkaline AA, are more powerful than the ones I was trying to use. I went to the store and got some rechargables and it seems OK again. Shoots very good pictures and video.", "Date": "November 30, 2013"}, {"Title": "very nice easy camera", "Author": "courtteck", "ReviewID": "R3Q2SK14B34F8V", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "It is very nice and does everything I wanted but it can't except other lens that why I rated at 4", "Date": "November 22, 2013"}, {"Title": "I used to look coolpix", "Author": "SJ Symo", "ReviewID": "R3J1PP8ZYWVJXF", "Overall": "2.0", "Content": "I have used cool pix for years and i thought this cool zoom lens would be an upgrade, but I have to say it wasn't right for me.
