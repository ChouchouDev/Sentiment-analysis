{"Reviews": [{"Title": "Too many compromises.", "Author": "Jeff Kraus", "ReviewID": "R147BUG7MQ95IC", "Overall": "2.0", "Content": "The DSC-W730 contains a 16.1 megapixel sensor in the 1/2.3\" format (about 28 square millimeters, smaller than a fingernail). The obvious drawback here is noise.  The more pixels you cram into a small area, the more digital noise that will be evident in the resulting file. On its own, that's a reduction in quality that negates the need for such a dense sensor; who cares about the extra megapixels if you're not getting any more actual information, just noise? All it's doing is filling up your hard drive faster.  In the case of the DSC-W730, you're talking about around 6.5MB per image.  You'll even hit the limits of the optics well before 16.1 megapixels, so there's absolutely no reason (other than marketing) for Sony to put such a sensor in this camera.Unfortunately, they did it anyway.  And probably because of the increased sensor noise, they decided to really crank up that in-camera noise reduction.  It looks awful, and it's evident at all ISO settings.  This NR cannot be reduced or defeated. It's there for good, and it's even noticeable when viewing an image on my computer at 50% of its original size.  Of course, the higher the ISO, the more destructive they get with the noise reduction, which just makes matters worse.  The issues are somewhat less noticeable when shooting low ISO outdoors with the lens at its widest setting.  In fact, in that specific scenario I'd say the image quality is pretty good.  Once you change any of those parameters though, you start to see more problems.The lens is an 8x optical (25-224mm in 35mm terms) lens, f/3.3 at the wide end and f/6.3 at the tele end.  In other words, slow and dark.  You will almost always need to use the flash indoors, especially if you're zooming in at all.  Autofocus indoors with zoom is spotty at best and generally takes a couple of seconds to lock on to something (if it can lock onto anything at all).  Sony attempted to combat this by adding a retina-frying orange LED as an AF-assist lamp, but while it might occasionally increase the odds of getting good focus on a subject indoors, it doesn't really seem to speed the process up at all. Outdoors (and sometimes indoors with the lens zoomed out all the way), the camera locks focus much quicker (around half a second).In the majority of cases, indoor flash photos are exposed pretty accurately.  Outdoors without flash, I noticed in many cases the camera underexposed by 1/2 to 1 stop, and sometimes even more underexposed that that when trying to shoot indoors without flash (especially when zoomed in at all). Combined with the existing noise from the ISO setting and the very heavy handed application of NR, trying to bring up the exposure of those ambient light indoor shots to normal levels is going to increase the shadow noise quite a bit.  It's not pretty.The build quality is about what I'd expect from a low-end compact in this price range, entirely plastic. It may not be particularly confidence inspiring, but for the most part it seems pretty solid. It's small and light enough to carry easily in a pocket.  I'm not a huge fan of the shutter button though, which has no distinct half-press.  It's there, but you can't really tell when you've gotten there like you can with most cameras. You just sort of rest your finger on it with some light pressure.There are a couple of interesting features, such as a panorama mode that operates similar to that of a phone camera -- rather than taking several shots and stitching them, it does a panning style capture.  There's a \"smile detection\" mode, which I admit was fun for a couple of minutes.  When engaged (there's a shortcut button on the camera for it so you don't need to dig into the menus to turn it on) it actively searches out a smiling face.  When it sees one, it automatically takes a picture. I'm not sure how it works with groups (do they all need to be smiling, or just one?) but regardless I think the novelty won't last long with that feature.My suggestion?  Honestly, if you're determined to find a camera in this price range and you can't save your pennies for something better, I'd recommend looking at the used/refurb market. For example, top-of-the-line Canon Powershot SD cameras from late 2009 were about the same size and weight as this DSC-W730, around 12 megapixels (still more than enough for any camera this size), built like small tanks, with better optics and overall better image quality.  These days even those high-end models can be bought for less than this camera.  A quick search shows that an excellent condition Canon Powershot SD980 IS can be had for around $60-$80 (or refurbished by Canon for $129 which I think includes a warranty) and that was the best, most expensive Powershot SD model of its time. It even has a big touchscreen display.", "Date": "May 20, 2013"}, {"Title": "...Awesome Photos! :)", "Author": "Katharena M. Eiermann \"Existential Diva -- Pr...", "ReviewID": "RO74WLDDK12BZ", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "Sony DSC-W730 16.1 MP Digital Camera with 2.7-Inch LCD (Silver)Impressive right out of the box which contains one Sony DSC-W730 16.1 MP Digital Camera with 2.7-Inch LCD, an AC Adaptor, Rechargeable Battery Pack, Dedicated USB Cable, Wrist Strap. note: there are no memory sticks or cards included.Some of the Many features the Sony DSC-W730 16.1 MP Digital Camera with 2.7-Inch LCD has, that stood out for Me:I might suggest, the first thing one does, before anything else -- attach the, longer than normal, wrist strap (included).  Wouldn't want to, accidently, drop (*shudders at the thought*) your new Sony 16.1 MP Digital Camera before having the chance to fully explore all the bells-and-whistles.I chose the Silver Cyber-Shot, which has a sort of brushed satin, finger print resistant finish.  Sleek and classy, goes with most any outfit!  The screen is large and (for Me) easy to view without using a magnifying glass. The slightly recessed buttons are easy to press, respond well. The camera navigates from mode to mode, function to function et al with ease and is pretty fast. When powered on, the navigation icons, are good sized, colorful and invoke a sense of fun -- and, have readable balloon pop ups that explain what each selection does.Using a dedicated side slide type button, switching between Still Images, Panorama 360\u00b0 (that's a full circle) and  720p HD Movie mode is an absolute breeze. Pressing the zoom toggle switch, camera responded quickly -- zoom in, zoom out -- without any lag, or stiffness.The built in flash is very bright, and does an excellent job of lighting the subject, or adding a bit of fill flash to a dark area (like shade).On the bottom of the Sony DSC-W730 16.1 MP Digital Camera with 2.7-Inch LCD, is a dedicated tripod socket hole.  I was able to screw (mount) the camera onto a monopod and 3 different tripods, that I use regularly, with ease -- resulting in a secure fit with no wobbling.The Instruction Manual is very concise and informative.  The graphics are clear and understandable. There is also an in-camera guide.  With a couple of clicks of a button, one can have their own personal guided through instructional of most anything this camera can do -- plus, it will always be in the camera, in case it is needed on-the-fly, so to speak.  Nice! :)Charging the battery:  Insert (supplied) battery in camera, connect the camera to the AC adaptor (supplied) using the dedicated USB cable (supplied). Connect the AC adaptor to the wall outlet.  Orange light comes on (camera) when charging.  About an hour later, light is off, camera battery is fully charged.  Easy!  Insert Memory card (not included). I used a Standard SD HC 16 gig Flash card, class 10 -- and it worked just fine for all functions.Right off the bat, there are 2 modes one can choose from:  Easy Mode (for those who just wish to pick up the camera and Photograph) and the Standard Mode -- for Creative shooting with Picture and Beauty effects etc.*  16.1 megapixel plus 8x optical zoom captures detailed subjects -- that 16.1 megapixels means about a print size of 13x19.  One can easily chose from a variety of qualities/sizes.*  Optical SteadyShot Image stabilization with 2-way active mode. After taking 50 photographs, I had no blurry photos.*  Continuous shooting mode. Fantastic for capturing multiple still images at action packed events without pausing:  soccer, baseball, basketball, ballet recitals, parades, birds in flight etc.Whew!  Lots more to explore with the Sony DSC-W730 16.1 MP Digital Camera with 2.7-Inch LCD.  This camera will keep one busy for a very long time. *sips espresso* :)Does the Sony DSC-W730 16.1 MP Digital Camera with 2.7-Inch LCD, sound like what you may be looking for? :)  Highly Recommended!  --Katharena Eiermann, 2013", "Date": "May 29, 2013"}, {"Title": "For the Lucky", "Author": "Nerd Alert", "ReviewID": "R56K01NDSLRKD", "Overall": "3.0", "Content": "I do not own a DSLR, and I have never purchased a fancy camera. My cameras have always been in the same price range as the Sony DSC-W730, but that is not so bad any more. Some companies are making startlingly good cameras for the budget point-and-shoot crowd. Is Sony's new contender worthy of the competition?BUILDThe DSC-W730 is compact, though not as small as some cameras in this category. Still, it's easily pocketable or pursable. The housing is made of plastic with chrome plastic accents, and there is no attempt to make it particularly sleek. Exposed screws and large seams may make it look cheaper than its price tag, but it all feels durable and ready to take a few drops.The SD card slot is a bit flimsy, but careful use should prevent it from breaking. Storage space should not be an issue given the compatibility with SDXC cards.INTERFACEThis is my first Sony camera, so the interface was a bit confusing. The lack of a scroll wheel for options made me think that the screen would allow touch, but it does not. Navigating through the options is a bit slow and unintuitive. Switching between picture, panorama, and movie modes is accomplished with a handy slider, and the screen is bright enough to see on a moderately sunny day.IMAGE QUALITYGiven my positive results with other cameras in this price range (and perhaps low standards compared to DSLR owners), I figured that the complaints about this product were from picky users expecting too much. I was wrong. Compared to others I've used (Canon, Olympus, Kodak), the pictures are very grainy and sometimes blurry. This is a shame, since I was excited about the 16 MP resolution. The pictures look like they were snapped from a low end phone rather than a dedicated camera. However, every once in a while, with bright outdoor light, everything works just right and the picture is not bad at all. What is the issue?One problem is perhaps a small sensor, which means that the subject of the image and my hand need to be very still to avoid motion blur. The advertising on the Amazon page talks about image stabilization, but I do not see it working. A tripod would help with this, so this camera might work for product shots for ebay.Another issue is the slow and unpredictable auto-focus. With a point-and-shoot, auto-focus must work well, since we aren't focusing manually. Most camera manufacturers have this down to a science at this point, and surely Sony does as well with their higher end cameras. In general, the software seems completely confused, and the auto scene selection (nighttime, macro, etc.) is random. I am not sure what happened during development, but taking a photo with this camera is like playing the lottery. Do you feel lucky?Panorama mode is a major bullet point in the advertising and has its own button, so I played with it in different environments. Overall, it works, though the focus and contrast issues of the still images can be exacerbated. It is a fun effect, but for a photo that you want to keep of family or a cool nature spot, I suggest taking a series of pictures and using software to do the panorama. The difference for me was night and day, and you can even do it in free software like the photo editor that comes with Windows. One caveat: do not use burst mode to take the pictures. The focus is far too sluggish for that and the software is not smart enough to keep up. Even with the super slow burst rate, the pictures look like a mess.VIDEO QUALITYMy old low end Canon point-and-shoot (and my phone) don't have HD video, so I was looking forward to trying out the video on the DSC-W730. It is nice to have video in widescreen and with smooth zooming during video. When zooming, the motor noise is not obnoxious. This was my favorite aspect of the camera, and I've included a video with this review. The downside, which is not so evident in this video, is that the picture can be soft and not \"HD\" looking because it isn't sharply in focus. If you are taking a video of people or moving around, the camera is easily confused and can make everything blurry for a long time. This can happen with any camera that doesn't have a big depth-of-field, but it happens a lot more with this camera than others.EDIT: Amazon would not allow my video to be posted because they said it violated their guidelines.  It was of some trees and a pond, so I don't know why.  Sorry about that.CONCLUSIONSFor all of my critiques, I don't hate the DSC-W730. While the image quality and speed is more reminiscent of my cheapo phone than a point-and-shoot in this price range from a company like Canon, some pictures come out very nicely. It is not just a hardware problem, but perhaps even more critically a software problem. The video fares better, though again it doesn't compete well with Canon. In this very competitive low end compact camera category, it is hard to recommend the DSC-W730. It could be a worthwhile purchase if it goes on a deep sale.", "Date": "May 25, 2013"}, {"Title": "Great camera", "Author": "daniel", "ReviewID": "R8OYGH6IDYFIQ", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I am a regular traveler, who uses the camera on these travels only, and for me that camera worked perfectly.

Brzostek", "ReviewID": "R1YXUH9Q9JDKKY", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I have owned several digital cameras, most of which were made by Sony.  This camera is on the more simple side to use, but still takes some quality photos for a \"point and shoot\" style of camera.The Sony DSC-W730 16.1 MP Digital Camera with 2.7-Inch LCD is similar to the last digital camera I bought (Sony Cyber-shot DSC-WX150 18.2 MP Exmor R CMOS Digital Camera with 10x Optical Zoom and 3.0-inch LCD).  While this one doesn't have quite as many MP, the price is also considerably lower than what I paid for the fancier model.  The Sony Cyber-shot is honestly a lot more complicated to use as it has so many settings and it is easy to take blurry looking photos with that if you have it in the wrong setting.  Oddly enough, the photos always look fine on the screen of the camera, but not when on the computer if you have it set incorrectly.So while the Sony DSC-W730 might not have all the bells and whistles of the Cyber-shot, it probably has all the best features and is much easier to use.  I found it very simple and intuitive to use.  This camera is going to be best for those who want a low cost camera that can take nice looking simple photos.As with pretty much all cameras, you will have to get a memory card (which for $10 to $35 you will be able to get a real decent one).  Again, like most cameras, this one doesn't have a case.  It does have a strap and a recharge cord for the battery (which is nice as it is such an improvement from the days of having to buy batteries that last for about an hour in a digital camera).", "Date": "June 20, 2013"}, {"Title": "Nifty little camera that takes good photos.", "Author": "William Polm", "ReviewID": "R15DIE6WEK2J45", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "This camera works fine for me.When I tried to use a Canon SD card I kept getting error messages: either \"no card\" or \"not enough memory on the card.\"It definitely had trouble reading the Canon SD card, but when I tried others (Transcend 16Gb, for example) they worked fine. The camera does not come with a card, so keep that in mind if you order one. It also does not come with a USB connector cord.Some reviewers concluded that the image quality is poor. I found just the opposite. Now this is not a technical review, like some others on this page, but I tested this camera against my phone camera (Samsung Brightside SCH-U380, 4 MP), a Canon Elph (Sd8009is, 7.1MP), and my Canon SX30is (14.1MP). Frankly, the Sony's photos came out clearer than all the other cameras. I was a bit surprised (after those negative reviews), so tried the the test a second time. Same result. Also the colors were right on when compared to the scene (using my eyes to view it).Reviewers also mentioned that the  battery door seems thin and weak.  It does seem a little thin, but here's what to watch out for: make sure the SD card is pushed all the way in until it \"clicks\" in place, then shut the door and move its button to closed. Once I did this, the door seemed solid enough. And I had no problems with the camera reading the card or using its battery.An excellent quality is the size and weight of the camera. It is light and small. It will fit easily into most pockets. I recommend using the small strap that comes with it: since it is so small, it would be easy to drop.My daughter is using this camera to photograph items to display on her website because she, too, found that its photos were sharper than those taken with our other cameras.  I will use it on sketching outings to capture scenes where there is not enough time to stay and paint.Recommended.", "Date": "June 2, 2013"}, {"Title": "It's a 9.5 on a scale of 10.", "Author": "Tom Zeni", "ReviewID": "R33DIBJ9XW55RL", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "The Sony DSC-W730 is all I could expect from a point and shoot camera. We travel extensively, and my wife enjoys scrapbooking, So this light, flexible use camera is perfect for taking all types of photos. The mode of picture/pano/movie is easy to change. The 8x zoom is as much as anyone with normal photographing needs. And with the lithium battery and a 16gb SD card, you are good to go for the entire day.  After years of carrying bulky Nikons and Cannons with various lens, this Sony, and others that I've had previously owned, is a joy to own.I really enjoy the panoramic mode, especially when traveling and taking photos of wide vistas of various types. I've taken great photos of PNC Park in Pittsburgh, The Red Rock Canyon in Las Vegas,the rainforest of the Eastern Caribbean just to mention a few. And there are online sites that will print them, or you can crop them to suit your needs.My only downside is the 16 megapixel images. The files are large, and to upload them to an online photo service takes more time than my previous Sony. A 6.5 meg picture is a lot of megapixels. Clear, sharp, absolutely, but my previous camera with 14meg was just as clear. The good thing is you don't need to shoot in the 16meg mode. You can reduce it to 10, and even further down. I would have wished the gap from 16 to 10 wouldn't have been so distant from each other. A 12meg setting would have been a better choice.In closing, if you're not some special effects buff, and the Sony does do some of that, like a fireworks mode, etc, but take photos of vacations, birthdays, sporting events, and all around general use, you can't find better than this Sony for quality and weight.", "Date": "July 20, 2013"}, {"Title": "great camera for the average tourist", "Author": "L.

This is a great pocket camera that I can take anywhere because of its small size.  I'm not a photo professional, so I think it takes decent photos and movies.  However, there are some trade-offs.  The camera has an entirely plastic body.  This makes it lightweight but it also gives it a cheap feel.  The LCD screen is smaller than my other cameras because of the overall small size (only 3\" diagonal) but it's adequate.The battery charges directly in the camera, so I don't think having a spare battery is a viable option.  The battery charges one of two ways: via the mini-USB cable plugged into the power adapter and into the wall, or via the mini-USB cable plugged into a computer USB slot.I like that there's a built-in instruction guide in the camera, so if I'm away from home I can still check how to use a feature if I forget.While this camera is intuitive to use, transferring images to my PC was not. I expected to connect it to my PC and find it as a drive (like with every other camera I've used) but the DSC-W730 will not show up under File Explore by default.  It required me to download and install the SONY \"Play Memories\" software for transfer of my photos and videos.I love the Panorama mode!  Set the camera to this and it automatically takes five shots in a sweep, all adjusted exposure etc, and stitches them right on the camera for remarkably cool panorama shot.There are some photo effects, like those you might normally apply via additional software on your PC, that you can apply directly on the camera as you take the shot.  I particularly like the Partial Color effect.  It takes a b&w; shot with the color of my choice highlighted.  EG: a red rose, only the rose would be red and the background would be b&w.;  This makes for some truly striking imagery.  Can be applied to stills, movies, or panoramas.IN THE BOX:* Sony DCS-W730 camera* Wrist strap* Sony NP-BN lithium ion battery* Proprietary Mini-USB cable* Power charging adapter* User's GuideNOTE: The camera does not come with any sort of flash card included, not even a tiny one.

Instead, it takes pictures as good as or a bit better than other point-and-shoot cameras in its price range.I have a current generation smart device that I was using to take pictures prior to receiving this camera, and I will probably continue to use it for snappy pictures since I usually have it right beside me. However, the flash and image optimization can leave a bit to be desired at times, and this camera avoids that *in most instances*.I'm generally a very pale person, and I have a hard time with point-and-shoot and smart phone cameras leaving me with white ghost face, but the automatic image optimization and flash adjustment of the Sony actually left me looking the way I look in the mirror. Ditto for my husband, though his problem isn't paleness -- cameras usually just make his wrinkles look more prominent than they are because of a hot flash -- this doesn't.In addition to portraits I took several outdoor pictures of both landscapes and objects as well as indoor photos of objects using the default, automatic settings. Approximately 25% of my outdoor pictures with really dense colors (large swaths of freshly excavated dirt, a wide tree canopy) had a fair amount of noise (when viewed full-size on my computer monitor) in the areas where the colors were deepest. When viewing a 4-by-6 print, this isn't noticeable.With some close-up shots both with and without the macro setting, it took a few snaps to get a photo without the object in the foreground being soft with a sharp background. I experienced better results with a tripod (which the average point-and-shoot user may not want to use or have handy for most pictures).Indoor macros also experienced this phenomenon but not to the extent of the outdoor shots since the camera flash tuned in differently to compensate for the lack of indoor light.Most of my pictures (95% ish) had stunning colors that translated beyond the viewing menu to my computer monitor and then prints.I had a Panasonic Lumix briefly last year and returned it because it was overkill for a point-and-shoot and required too much work to take good pictures consistently. If I wanted that kind of trouble, I would invest in a DSLR and dedicate time to learning how to operate it properly. I don't want that. I have only ever been interested in point-and-shoots that let me get the picture I want within a few shots if I'm doing something posed or that will take nice pictures for reproduction as 4 by 6 (and occasionally 8 by 10) prints for a scrapbook.

While most of the unit is housed in a metallic plastic case build quality seems decent for the price point.  What I appreciated the most was its compact sizing (slightly smaller then a deck of cards) and speed at which the unit can go from power-off to photo taken in less than 2 seconds.  The 8x optical zoom goes through its progressions smooth and quickly and the 3 inch LCD display is adequate when considering the devices size.  The menu and options UI is mostly standard and intuitive if you've used other point and shoot cameras over the past 5 years.

Also, the red laser beam scanning thing for the smile detector is kind of annoying.  The camera did not come with a memory card, as far as I could tell, and without one it only holds 4 pictures on the default quality setting. So definitely bigger memory card is needed.Overall it seems like a very good camera for a beginner like me.  Not too complex, and mostly easy and convenient to use.

Both are excellent.", "Author": "Amazonian Consumer", "ReviewID": "R250BLC9QBIZFS", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "Currently, the DSC-W730 is the lowest priced Sony that comes with a Carl Zeiss-licensed lens. And Lumix SZ3 is the lowest priced Panasonic Point-and-Shoot digital camera that comes with a Leica-licensed lens. Leica and Carl Zeiss are legendary German photographic lens designers who are known for their super sharp and accurate color lenses. Not all Sony and Panasonic cameras have Carl Zeiss and Leica marking on the lens, respectively. Those that do not cost less, but I always choose ones that do.I have both of the above cameras and like them very much because they take excellent, sharp, color accurate pictures without costing a lot of money. The Panasonic costs a bit more, but both are excellent.The Lumix SZ3 has a slightly greater zoom range of 10X, compared to Sony's 8X. Both cameras have the wide end of the zoom lens at 25mm (35mm film camera lens equivalent), which is great for group and scenery shots.I prefer the SZ3 camera's physical user interface, especially the direct \"movie button\" and the shutter button surrounded zoom lever. They are more convenient and easier to use than Sony's.On the other hand, the Sony W730 consistently shoots better fill-in flash scenes than the Panasonic Lumix SZ3. The resulting images look very good, as you almost can't tell that fill-in flash is used.When reviewing pictures taken, the Sony displays a \"rough, unclear\" image first, then sharpens up in a split second, while the Panasonic can display each shot without this extra step.The W730 shoots video in 720p at 30 frames per second (fps), while the SZ3 does it in 24 fps. Some users like the 24 fps frame rate because the resulting video looks more film-like, or movie-like than when shot at 30 fps or higher.I buy extra compatible batteries on eBay. For the W730, you can typically get one for about $5, or 3 batteries plus a charger for $13. The aforementioned prices include free shipping. Just search \"Sony W730 battery\".If you need a carrying pouch for this camera, I'd recommend Case Logic's DCB-302 (less than $6) Case Logic DCB-302 Compact  Case for Camera - Black. Its size is just right for the W730, with a few centimeters of extra space so it isn't too snug. The small accessories pocket is perfect for memory cards and batteries.Instead of using the pouch's shoulder strap, I urge you to tie the camera's wrist strap to one of the two shoulder strap ringlets, so that the camera and the case are loosely tied together. The arrangement permits me to hold the case with my left hand while I take pictures with my right hand. If someone bumps into me at this moment, my camera is less likely to fall to the ground, as its wrist strap is tied to the case held by my left hand.", "Date": "November 15, 2013"}, {"Title": "better than expected", "Author": "Mark Perry", "ReviewID": "R19OQTS5WW18JU", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "Bought for my fianc\u00e9, and she loves it.

I almost never get decent results from them.  I've spent the past six years shooting only with a Canon DSLR (Canon EOS Rebel T3i 18 MP CMOS Digital SLR Camera and DIGIC 4 Imaging with EF-S 18-55mm f/3.5-5.6 IS Lens) or my cell phone.  For my children, my usual go to brand of point and shoot cameras has been Kodak (Kodak Easyshare M530 12 MP Digital Camera with 3x Wide Angle Optical Zoom and 2.7-Inch LCD (Carbon)) simply because the cameras typically give them good results and are very user friendly when it comes to choosing different modes (portrait, sports, low light, etc.).  Recently I had mentioned to my husband that I probably should get a little point and shoot camera that I could slip in my bag or pocket for those times when I don't really want to lug my DSLR all over the place but might still want to take pictures.  When presented with the opportunity to review this Sony camera I figured it was worth a shot.What I like about this camera is it's compact size.  I also like that it has a rechargeable battery.  I refuse to buy any point and shoot camera that runs on regular batteries, so the rechargeable battery is certainly a plus.  Appearance wise, the camera looks nice.  What I like about the camera pretty much stops there.I found this camera to be a pain in the rear as far as navigating the menu to change settings was concerned.  They make it near impossible to play with the settings easily.  In that area, every Canon and Kodak point and shoot I've ever operated has Sony beat.  The irritating toy like sounds this camera makes drove me crazy and convinced me that it was just a cheap camera that looked nice, but I still needed to take some pictures and see how they turned out.  I wasn't impressed.  The camera just doesn't take a very impressive picture.  I think my iPhone 4s takes a far better picture, and I'm really not all the impressed with the pictures my phone takes.  I honestly expected better picture quality from a dedicated point and shoot camera.  I'm sure there have to be a better compact point and shoot camera out on the market than this one.

It technically still takes photos, but they're blown out and marred by horizontal lines. Oddly, it still takes video just fine and does panoramas without issue. I have no idea what the problem is, but the camera has been replaced by a Nikon COOLPIX S31 10.1 MP Waterproof Digital Camera with 720p HD Video (White) for Christmas.Original Review (June 20, 2013): The big draw here over other low-end cameras is the 8x zoom but my title says it all: I'm not real impressed with the quality of the images, as I think the Sony firmware compresses the images too much which compromises image quality, making them murky and blobby when viewed close-up, but my 7 year old daughter took to the camera right away, figuring out its features and falling in love with it immediately. That zoom lets her get up close to all the things she wants pictures of - birds, bugs, trees, etc. And in her hands, over less expensive but less-capable cameras, she gets some great stuff. She's even had fun with the panorama feature, which she just stumbled on and figured out by the on-screen instructions.This camera wants to be the answer for adults who want a very compact point-and-shoot, but it simply isn't good enough for most adults when we all have smartphones that have similar quality cameras built-in and which are lacking only the zoom. I think most of us, if we are interested in good photos, are willing to shell out a bit more and get a better quality camera for that kind of zoom (or more) and better quality pictures. You're not going to find it here. But if you're looking for a solid \"second camera\" for you school-age kids, this might suit your needs.", "Date": "June 20, 2013"}, {"Title": "Average Camera for Fun Use", "Author": "A Customer", "ReviewID": "R3TOGXMOOZ5UDE", "Overall": "3.0", "Content": "Sony has a great name in electronics (although coming under attack), and is building a solid brand in mid-range digital cameras to compete with the Nikons and Canons of the world (myself, I'm a Nikon man after being a Contax man!).The average consumer will buy this camera because (a) it's a Sony, (b) 16 megapixals, (c) small size and (d) feature set.  For snapshots, fun use, little movies they'll be very happy with it.  For something beyond that, it will probably disappoint.For a point and shoot, I have a Nikon L26 which is very competitive to the DSC-W730, and I would choose the Nikon over the Sony for these reasons:-Shutter speed on Sony is slower (and the Nikon is not particularly fast), meaning that for fast action (sports, children, pets) you may miss the action-Menu system on Sony is more confusing than that on the Nikon-Build quality is a step or two below the Nikon (I've only used the Sony briefly and it doesn't seem as solid as the Nikon, which I've used for about a year and it is just as firm as the day I bought it)-Image quality is lacking-it might be using too high an ISO setting, or something else, but the pictures lack the Nikon's sharpnessOverall, it is a good camera but in this price range there are better choices.

I can't currently find the pictures I downloaded  into PlayMemories but there are a lot of previous pictures that are now handily stored in one central location.  Not the drive I wanted it on but hopefully it will switch easily.I was just getting started with this camera and I asked my teenager a question.  Within seconds he'd already set up the time, language and who knows what all else before I could stop him and do it myself.This camera really needs a small case to keep it safe and dust free.  I was able to use a small zip pouch I already keep in my purse- like a small makeup bag.  I'd prefer a harder case but this works for now.The pictures I've taken so far aren't amazing and I wish I'd sat closer to the front of the auditorium for graduation night.  It took great close ups of my garden from the upstairs window so it will just take some practice to figure out the best distances for pictures for different situations.I love the size.  Just like all cameras these days you'll have to buy a memory card- shop around so you'll know what's a deal and what's not.  I got an 8GB? card from Walgreens originally marked around $40 down to around $13. I just saw a 16 GB? card on Amazon for around $15.

I have tried adjusting the settings but for some reason half of my pictures just come out fuzzy looking.

Wang \"jwangamazon\"", "ReviewID": "R3FU4JGBWQ2MRD", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "This Sony DSC W370 is light, and small enough to slide into a pocket easily. For people with big hands, you might want to attach a long strap to the camera to prevent dropping it by mistake. The menu system is pretty intuitive for settings. Nevertheless, this's a simple point-and-shoot, not much settings for me to play around. The screen is large and bright enough to see on a moderate sunny day. The small battery is the same as the one used in my Sony DSC-TX10. Be aware, the small battery won't hold too much charge (I learned it from using my Sony DSC-TX10), if you plan to use the camera for a long day, you should get a backup battery. The backup batteries are quite available in Amazon, with pretty good price.The built in flash is strong enough to improve the lighting condition for objects in 6 feet range. Time from power-off to photo taking is less than 2 second, which is good for this small camera. The delay between shot is about 1 second if no flash light is used. When flash light is used, you need to wait a little bit longer for charging the flash light, this is pretty typical for camera in this price range.The photo quality is just ok as the photo does not seem to be sharp. When shooting indoor where lighting is weak, you can see some grainy photos. The problem is less when shooting outdoor with good lighting.In video taking mode, the menu already declares that zooming noise will be captured by the camera. I usually edit my videos, so I can silent the zooming noise from the video clips. Not a big issue to me. When you move your camera around in video mode, the camera adjusts the focus continuously. This is a camera, not a camcorder. So, don't move camera too fast, this gives camera time to adjust focus continuously.The panorama mode is just for fun as the panorama photo quality is not very impressive. If you are seriously in creating panorama photos, I recommend to take still shots and create the final panorama photo with photo editing software.The 8x lens is a big selling point for such a small point-and-shoot camera. But the image stabilization does not seem to be strong enough. So, you need a very steady hand to take advantage of the 8x lens, otherwise the photo will be blurry.All in all, for price under $100, this would be a good buy.
