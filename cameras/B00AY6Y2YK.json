The ability to take good quality pictures as well as Full HD video eliminates the need to also carry a video camera.The camera has several shooting modes to select from such as Portrait, Panorama, etc...  Pictures look realistic, they are sharp and the colors are vivid and natural.  The image stabilization helps take sharp photos; I found this especially useful when using the zoom for long distance.As they claim, the pictures at low-light are very good, much better than I expected.  At my daughters dance show, they allowed the audience to take photograph without flash.  The pictures and videos came out real good considering the distance that I had to zoom and the low light.The built in HD video camera (CMOS) recording quality is very good.  There is a separate button to record videos.  You can also pause the video recording so you don't end up with a bunch of short clips.The camera has editing features to do things like lighten skin tones, whiten teeth, whiten eyes, reduce dark circles beneath the eyes, and apply a blush-like effect to cheeks.With the built-in wireless you can quickly send your pictures and video to your smart phone, tablet, etc... to email them to your friends and family, or post them online.  This beats having to take your memory card out of the camera or plug the camera to a computer to share your pictures.  You are also supposed to be able to control the camera with your smart phone; however, I haven't tried that yet.Options for Image size: 16MP - 4608 x 3456, 8MP - 3264 x 2448, 4MP - 2272 x 1704, 2MP - 1600 x 1200, VGA - 640 x 480, 16:9 (12MP) 4608 x 2592", "Date": "February 14, 2013"}, {"Title": "Good Camera, Great Price (Wifi description)", "Author": "S.

You open the App and you can either use your I\"product\" to \"take a picture\" remotely (great for family shots, but the camera still has the 2 second and 10 second timer mode), or you can View the photos on your camera, and upload them to your iproduct instantly.  It is GREAT!!!!  There is no need for any special attachment for your ipad/phone to insert the SD card (I already have this, but won't need it now).When you are done, you turn the Wifi off on the camera, as it is a battery suck, and your wifi on your iproduct goes back to whatever hotspot you were usually using for uploading to social media, or whatnot.", "Date": "June 6, 2013"}, {"Title": "Very Good Camera for the price. :)", "Author": "Lexi", "ReviewID": "R16QYFQRHOA67X", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "Overall this camera has lived up to what I expected from it.

I saw this one and was drawn to it's name. The word \"wi-fi\" is prominent right there in it's name, appearing even before the word \"camera\".Nikon COOLPIX S6500 Wi-Fi Digital Camera.That's why I was disappointed to learn what that really means (or rather doesn't mean). No you can't use this \"wi-fi\" camera to shoot pics and upload them to the net, cloud storage, social media or anything like that at all. You cannot connect this wi-fi camera to your home network or any network, let alone the internet. What Nikon means when they say \"wi-fi camera\" is that it connects to your smart phone and then you can transfer pics to it wirelessly. In a sense that sounds something like a Bluetooth connection, but If I wanted a camera with blue-tooth I would have shopped for a camera with blue-tooth. What this does is turn into a \"hot-spot\" that you connect your smartphone to just as you would browse for routers or hot-spots and connect to them. You just connect to your camera instead.This is how it is supposed to work in theory any way, but I have yet to be able to actually connect my Motorola Droid 3 to the wi-fi camera. If that sounds like a wi-fi camera to you, then you might not be dissapointed (or if you don't care about having a real \"wi-fi camera.\"I'm not reviewing the rest of the camera since that is done well enough by others here and on the photography sites. Yes, it's small, cute, stylish looking (I chose the orange color which is quite nice) and takes great pics especially given it's size and price. I want this review to strictly highlight the wi-fi issue. Another thing to be aware of is that it is very small and might even feel awkward for some, so I'd suggest a hand-on at a brick and mortar store before purchase. Yes it deserves more than 3 stars on the camera itself and I am partly to blame for not thoroughly vetting this before ordering (the low price-point had a lot to do with that and admittedly that in itself should had tipped me off. I feel though the harsh deduction is justified given the labeling \"Wi-Fi Camera\" and lack of clear information on just what that actually means.If someone tells you that if you like you health insurance, you can keep it, or tries to sell you a \"wi-fi\" camera, you'd better read the fine print (if you can find it).", "Date": "November 5, 2013"}, {"Title": "This Camera is Awesome!!!!", "Author": "Bonita", "ReviewID": "RBO6P1SHST0DO", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "First, I am not a professional photographer, but I love taking pictures of my grandchildren and the outdoors.

It replaced a camera I had with 3x zoom and 8 mp. First I used it at home to try it out. I took pictures with this camera and my old one of the same trees, car and sky. This camera blew my old one out of the water. THe pictures were crisp, clear and the zooming was amazing even close to its maximum zoom. The only problem I had was that I didn't change the scene to \"beach\" before taking the pictures of the sky. Once I did that, they were awesome.Now for the best part. The wi-fi. I took the camera to work becasue a co-worker needed some pics for a project. I took the pictures then realized that I forgot the USB cable. So I synced it to my iPhone and transferred the pics. Then I emailed the pictures from my hpone. It was so easy! I also used it on my bicycle with a bike mount for a Go Pro like experience and it worked perfectly! (bought the camera mount on Amazon)Now I am no way near a camera expert and don't even know what the mechanism is that makes the lens zoom in and out (don't judge me) but it seems like if anything were to break, it would be that. And if it does, I will cross that bridge when I get to it. My final recommendation would be that should you buy this camera, you spend some time getting to know it. I have found that some of the negative reviews would not be quite as negative if the people who boughtthe camera could navigate it a bit faster.

Roy", "ReviewID": "RZ0PQSDOOQK8U", "Overall": "1.0", "Content": "I had several issues with this camera, some were with the design. But ultimately it just stopped working after 2 months and I had to return it.  Lucky for me I bought it at Costco and they have an excellent return policy.  I'll admit I didn't do much research before buying this, as I needed to get it fast before leaving on vacation.  It's been a few years since I've bought a digital camera so now I know what to look for.For starters, there's the Wi-Fi feature.  The camera creates a mini network or hotspot that your phone or tablet can connect to, and you use an app to transfer photos.  This worked ok, but it wasn't what I was expecting.  I was more hoping to connect to the camera similar to a network drive (smb  protocol).  What really annoyed me was the app on my tablet transferred all the photos at a lower resolution than they were taken.  Being on vacation, I was hoping to transfer photos and make room on the camera, but not deminish the quality in the process.Second annoyance is the proprietary power connection on the camera, which is not micro-USB.  Not only does this mean you have to bring this specific cable along when traveling (I'm already bringing micro USB cables for my phone/tablet), but there are two slots side by side on the camera  this connector will fit into, the other being a mini HDMI (I think).  Many times I've fit the plug into the wrong hole.  I'm not sure if this is what ultimately contributed to the camera not working.There is no tightening clasp on the wrist strap.  Seems like such a simple little thing, but my Canon Powershots always had them.  So if you're walking along with your camera in hand, you can't rely entirely on the strap to keep it secure.Picture quality could be very good, but could really suck too.  I didn't have it long enough to experiment with all the settings, and you need to play around with it a lot before you want to capture those fleeting moments that really count.No GPS feature. The phone app will \"add\" a location when you transfer the pictures. Unfortunately this is usually many miles and days away from where the photo was taken, so what's the point?No share with Facebook or email.  This is what I was really expecting with a WiFi-enabled camera.The camera finally stopped working.  I could plug it in and charge it, and the green LED would then on, but no response when pushing the power button, plugging into a computer, out pressing the play button to review pictures.

Auto HDR feature delivered very, very, very weak results, like overexposed pastel gray versions of regular non-HDR photos. Auto HDR photos had less dynamic range than regular photos. Lots of camera shake in strong daylight. Digital zoom was turned off, but I saw blocky edges on objects in 8 megapixel photos at less than full optical zoom. The blocky effect was probably from Nikon's choice to overcompress JPEGs. Self timer automatically turned itself off after being used, so I had to manually turn it back on over and over and over. Wind noise reduction did not work at all. Audio had loud pops and clicks that did not correspond to real world sound waves. Tiny, recessed power button often had to be pressed more than once to turn on the camera. There was no low saturation option, so it was impossible to photograph day-glo subjects. They had clipped highlights at EV -2.0. Glamour retouching produced bizarre results with way too much skin smoothing. Battery door impeded access to SD card, making it quite difficult to remove with door unable to swing open more than 90 degrees. USB port door impeded access, making it quite awkward and difficult to plug in the cord. Did not work with a Linux PC. Had to use a card reader, meaning I had to deal with the frustrating battery door too often. Camera rotated photos that didn't need rotation, with no option to disable auto rotation. Cumbersome interface with lots of submenus and the need to confirm, rather than simply choose options. Video start / stop button was recessed and difficult to operate. Buttons failed to respond for several seconds after camera appeared to be on and ready. EV reverted to 0 in most modes after powering down and up. Pop, Toy Camera, Cross Process, and Soft Focus modes produced hideously ugly photos. Nikon used a read only file system for SD card, making it impossible to reformat an 8 GB card in Linux. Upon checking to fix errors, the disk utility in Linux said the file system was not clean. Had to use another digital camera to reformat. Felt lied to. Felt tricked. Felt regret. Lost faith in ability of English language to convey true information. Lost faith in technological progress.Good points: Very pretty paint job. The metallic orange was lovely. The screen was OK. I liked having the tic tac toe grid overlay option to help align photos with horizons and vertical subjects. Product was superficially attractive. A lot of thought and care went into its surface appearance (and marketing). Interface and buttons were responsive. Macros were appealing when cropped from 16 megapixel originals.This product turned me from a Nikon admirer to a Nikon hater. I don't understand why a manufacturer would make products this awful, then put their company name on them. I wish the engineers simply made the basic functions of still photography fast and easy and left the gimmicky and disappointing extra features for third party software creators to worry about. I wish digital cameras just had 5 or 10 settings that stayed where the photographer left them. It's no fun remembering whether or not a certain feature switches itself off and on depending on what other features cluttering up the system are in use. The S6500 takes commands, makes one photo, then undoes the commands on the condescending presumption that users making camera adjustments don't know what they're doing. I'd rather take pictures in a creative flow with a passive camera, not have to fight and struggle repeatedly for influence over machines supposedly meant to augment human capabilities.

I kept the camera in my pocket and discovered if you put a couple heavy-duty rubber bands on it it's easy to grab and won't slide out of your pocket.

If you SLIGHTLY depress the trigger button when the Quick Effects screen appears it will disappear just as quickly, enabling a relatively fast second shot.  My only issue with the camera was the relatively short battery life, but that's solved by having a second/backup battery.  Now, if I can just remember to carry the backup battery with me -- rather than leaving it on the bus as I did on three occasions -- I would have had no issues at all.

It has a bunch of useful pre-programmed modes so those of us that are not good photographers can still take some pretty amazing pictures. Get the fastest memory card you can find because this camera is sluggish when saving and deleting pictures.The wireless feature is limited to cell phones and tablets. You can't use wireless to transfer pictures to a notebook/desktop computer or control the camera. Bummer.But the biggest flaw of this camera is the click button that just does not work most of the time. You click and nothing happens. So you need to keep clicking until it finally decides to snap a picture. It's not because the camera is busy saving the previous picture. It's something else. Maybe it can't focus or something. Whatever. But it just doesn't take the picture when you want it to. You will miss a lot of special moments because of this. It's extremely disappointing. Definitely not the camera for sports/action photography.For this reason alone I cannot recommend this camera to anybody. Get another brand.Video is HD 1080/30p, but the picture quality is not particularly good (and when moving it is downright awful in either 1080/30p or 720/60p). The length is limited to 30 min only. It doesn't matter if it can't take longer videos because the battery will promptly die after 30 min of video anyway.Simply stated, the zoom is the only thing this camera has that a modern phone does not have.

When you try to connect to the camera network from a PC it will not connect so you cannot directly use WiFi to transfer pix to a PC which I find restrictive.  The documentation for setting all this up is not clear at all using even the full manual but it is better than not having any WiFi at all.As for the camera itself I view it as a good value for the money for both stills and videos with the panoramic feature equivalent to my Iphone 5 where you sweep to get the picture which can be up to 360 degrees.  There are many picture processing features some better than others and most available in post processing software but I'm sure the target audience is looking for a final product out of the camera; I was really impressed with the BW options.  The zoom at max does have some chromatic aberration blue fringes but again the overall quality of the system is quite good.  As a lifetime photographer it still amazes me how far we have come with digital procession to automate the process and increase the probability of getting a good picture which can be optimized by simply taking multiple versions of the same scene since \"film\" is free and this cam has a high rate in burst mode.Provided you can live with the WiFi limitation above this is quite a good value for the $150 you pay for it as a package that easily fits in a pocket or handbag which means it will be available when the opportunity presents itself more than a larger camera and provides better quality pictures and features than current smartphones do.............", "Date": "November 8, 2013"}, {"Title": "Nice photos, but fragile", "Author": "Jen M.", "ReviewID": "R3MBRK60CLPH85", "Overall": "2.0", "Content": "This was my second and last Nikon product.

My biggest concern was shutter lag.  I had a Nikon point and shoot about 10 years ago, and while it took nice photos, the shutter lag made it impossible to use.  After pressing the button to take a picture, it literally took 2 or 3 seconds before the actual photo was taken.  There were many times when I had people pose and walk away before the shot was taken.  And this was not due to flash delay.  It was just that slow.  None of the other digital cameras (Canon, Fuji, Casio, Kodak, or Viviar) had this problem.  I am pleased to say that the S6500 does not suffer from this.  Press the shutter and it takes the shot.  There is a time delay when you process the photo with a special effect, but you do not have to do this after each shot-you can do it at any time later, like when you are watching TV or eating lunch when you are not going to be using your camera.3 of the nicest features-long zoom to wide angle range, excellent low light capability, and a dedicated button for video (so you don't have to switch any controls or go through a menu to change from snap shot to movie mode).  The lens seems to be very good, as the pictures are sharp.  And the high megapixel rating allows you to crop and blow up areas of the picture without losing resolution.  I also like the wind reduction feature, as I like taking videos from my car as I am driving, and since it is a Jeep, the wind sound used to be a big problem.  When the weather gets nice again, I will see how this setting really works out.  That said, the camera is small, about the same size as my Canon SD890 it is replacing (that camera still works fine, but i just wanted a new toy with newer features).  Plus, the batteries are much smaller, which is important to me as I always carry 2 spares with me.  THe controls are all pretty intuitive.  The slight drawback is that scrolling through the different camera settings and special effects requires you to only go left and right through the different icons, and not up and down which would speed up the process a little.

Being able to connect to the internet to upload photos to Flickr, Picasa, Facebook, or whatever was what I was expecting. The way it actually works was a little disappointing. Though the manual explains the feature pretty well:The camera\u2019s built-in Wi-Fi (wireless LAN) function* allows you to remotely release the shutterof the camera by operating a smart device that is wirelessly connected to the camera.The camera\u2019s monitor view is displayed on the screen of the wirelessly connected smartdevice, enabling you to remotely zoom the camera in or out on the subject. You can alsotransfer saved images from the camera to the smart device.* To use the Wi-Fi (wireless LAN) function, Wireless Mobile Utility must be installed on the smartdeviceLuckily I have a smartphone or it would have been even more disappointing. I was able to get it connected to my phone after a few tries. The app that I had to install on my android phone was pretty lack-luster and could definitely use some polishing, though it did the job.It potentially provides a way to send/share photos when out-and-about or on vacation which could be useful for some. It also lets you use your phone as a viewfinder for the camera and lets you remotely snap photos. This could be especially useful when using a tripod to eliminate camera movement. This is great for me since I bought the camera to photograph my artwork. In retrospect, the way the wi-fi feature actually works will probably prove more useful to me than my assumed social media connectivity.More importantly, I was very impressed with the image quality, especially when taking low-light photos. Taking a photo of a dimly lit room transforms it into a well lit room. The photos I took of darkly lit scenes actually looked better lit than they did when looking at the scene with a naked eye. I haven't messed with most of the other features of the phone yet. The retouch options seemed similar to something like Instagram filters which could be handy at some point. Of course, being able to connect your phone via wi-fi means that you could just use Instagram or any other photo editor on your phone.The only other negative I can think of is that it takes a few seconds to boot up from being powered off (there is a standby mode though), which could be an issue for people to snap photos spontaneously. Still, it's faster than opening the camera app on my phone. I bought the camera so I would stop using my phone as a camera (Optimus Elite) and to photograph artwork and other potentially low-light scenes. This camera fills that need perfectly and I would definitely recommend it for the price range.", "Date": "January 3, 2014"}, {"Title": "I like it !", "Author": "Janet Puig", "ReviewID": "R3C9BY98LPVE3X", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I really like it.

What I was mainly looking for was a small size that was comfortable to carry around. I was also looking for decent zoom for when I took pictures of landmarks and vistas, especially when I wanted to get the details in the work. At the same time, I wanted something that could focus quickly, and overall had a quick learning curve. I have to say I was quite impressed with the camera. I was a little unsure at first but it really takes nice pictures especially for the price. Playing around with it for a few days really taught what certain buttons did, what settings applied depending on the lighting. I was really surprised by the retouching software that comes in the camera. Its kind of fun to play around with and if used lightly it can really have a nice realistic effect since it does things like reduce redness in skin, increase eye size, change face size, etc. One of things I did not like was the fact that the camera is charged by connecting a cable from an outlet directly to the camera. I would have preferred a wall charger for the camera so I could have a spare battery charging while using the camera for taking pictures. While the battery has decent battery life, when I was out sightseeing, I had to be conscious about not keeping the camera turned on so that I did not inadvertently drain the battery.

It seems every few pictures, the camera refuses to do exactly that.  I tried several different settings, scenes, etc.to no avail and ended up missing some primo shots.  The camera had trouble with indoor shots even when on indoor party mode.  It kept using a slow ISP speed which led to lots of blurring.  Battery life was also about half of what I'm used to getting with digital cameras and that was with the wifi off.  Also, the buttons on the camera weren't all that responsive.Only good thing I can say about camera was it took really good video.", "Date": "June 8, 2013"}, {"Title": "Stars", "Author": "Jimmy Spencer", "ReviewID": "RO71TWU2D8Q1K", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "5 Stars should speak for themselves.
