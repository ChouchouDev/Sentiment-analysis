{"Reviews": [{"Title": "Solid performance, good value, Nikon nails it again!", "Author": "Yano", "ReviewID": "R14LV8W093RJSM", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "This camera may be the best APS-C in its class so far. After Nikon's quality control issue with the full-frame D600 (sensor oil spot problem), Nikon may be able to win back its trust with this new release, again aimed at enthusiasts and amateur photographers. Being an amateur photographer for years and have invested quite a sum in Sony, Canon and Nikon bodies and lenses, I myself settled with Nikon in personal preference. I would say all three brands got its personality (good and bad), especially with Sony pushing the translucent mirror technology.The D5200 is a step up from the D3200 as an entry to mid-level body. Very solid performance and thank god it does not suffer the fate of the D600. The D5200 produces extremely good quality images just like the D3200. Both the D3200 and D5200 share the 24MP sensor resolution, with the difference being the light sensitivity in high ISO situations. Both cameras are able to produce extremely well results in terms of photo quality. I am usually able to get better image results from the D3200 and D5200 compared with Sony's A65 and A77 in actual use. Sony somehow made the older A55 easier than the A65 and A77 at getting a clean and noise free shot (maybe due to sensor difference). So Nikon wins here, I would say the image quality of the D5200 is as good as the well acclaimed Canon 60D in most cases easily done (with the D5200 at a higher resolution). So the major difference of the D5200 compared with the D3200 is the focus sensor and exposure meter sensor. The D5200 borrows the technology from the bulkier D7000 and presents 39 AF points including 9 cross-type AF points for accuracy and a more precise exposure metering system (D3200 have 11 AF points, 1 cross-type). This is extremely useful in specific situations, such as shooting moving objects or in macro photography. The D3200 performed very well in everyday shooting, but with my 40mm and 60mm Nikon Micro lenses, the AF failed to accurately or effectively focus on very close subjects. The D5200 however is much better, the body focused efficiently on to desired subjects precisely. The focus speed is still mainly dependent on the lens.The swing-out LCD screen is useful in some situations and video shooting, but proves less useful to me. And keep in mind when using live-view, the camera no longer uses the phase-detection AF sensors, but rather switches to use contrast AF, which utilizes your APS-C image sensor and the CPU (less accurate and slower AF in most cases).The D5200 is not designed to be weatherproof, but it will survive a short time of mist and a few droplets. Anything more may just end up killing the camera. The battery life is very good for photos, will last you 1000+ shots on a single charge in most cases while not using live-view. However when you need it for a video project, consider carrying a few extra batteries with you or resort to an external power source.If you are starting out in Nikon or just DSLR in general, buy the 18-55mm Kit, and add on the 55-200mm VR lens (you get $100 discount bundled). The Nikon 55-200mm DX VR is a VERY GOOD lens, you do not want to get it later since you may be paying the full price for a new one. The VR (Nikon's optical vibration reduction) of the 55-200mm will allow you to capture subjects/people at a good wanted distance with extremely well image quality and brilliant background defocus, opens many doors for quality and creativity. The Nikon 55-200mm DX VR is one of the best lenses I have used and also at a very affordable price.The other kit lens offering of the D5200 is the 18-105mm kit. The 18-105mm is not very good and I'm not going to get too much into the details; it generally is not very good in terms of construction for a heavier lens and causes more barrel distortion.For me, how the function buttons are positioned on the D5200 is a little awkward, but for others it may just be a matter of time to get used to. Compared with the D5100, the D5200 is quite a big step-up in terms of crucial internal hardware.", "Date": "January 20, 2013"}, {"Title": "Nice step up from the D5100, Big Plus Articulating Screen!", "Author": "Adam Petrone \"Adam\"", "ReviewID": "R2AHN35SKV5UAX", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I upgrade every 2 years or so and was close to buying the D7000 when this was announced.  I owned the D5100 since it's release and have been very happy with it, but being a gadget guy I'm always looking to upgrade. As far as I was concerned the D7000 was buying old technology. I love the D5200's interface as it's much easier to navigate than the D5100 and the auto focus is much quicker and precise. The photo's are sharp and very accurate in color. I'm very happy with the D5200. Just for the 39-point AF system for smarter focusing and tracking of moving subjects (compared to the 11-point module on the D5100), a 2,016-pixel RGB metering sensor (whereas the D5100 judged exposure based on just 420 pixels),the new Expeed 3 processor that permits up to five shots per second (versus the older camera's 4 fps)and the new easier to navigate interface makes it worth the price. Let me just add 1 more very big plus, the articulating screen, no other Nikon has it and it is a big plus. I've used it for shots over others heads and other creative angles that I could never get with a fixed screen.", "Date": "February 13, 2013"}, {"Title": "ROCK SOLID PERFORMANCE!

While the Canon 6D only has 11 AF points and 1 cross type. The 6D is more than 2 times the cost and has 22MP. The Nikon D5200 has a rotating screen, picture control presets, aperture priority, shutter priority, P, and M modes. The D5200 has +/- 5 stops of exposure compensation, the 6D has 3!The D5200 has a great burst rate of 5fps. ISO range from 100-25,600. Exspeed 3 processing power, face recognition, and full time AF with full HD video. What more could you ask for when buying a camera less than $900? I did a complete hands on review video for \"Focus Camera\" in NYC. I will be posting it to this review sometime later in the week when finished.My thoughts are this camera is light, and while it is not as rugged as a 6D or D600 you get what you pay for. This camera provides great lowlight performance and stunning resolution that is higher than the $3400 5D mark II. Which is worth mentioning. Nikon has leaped ahead of the competition with their new line of cameras.The auto focus on this camera while doing some street and urban photography is very quick and accurate. I had a blast using it as the weight is a very big plus because it can be more easily carried for longer periods of time. If you are in market for a great camera and you are not willing to spend $2k for the D600, there is nothing that will compete with this camera in terms of \"Bang for Buck\" with either of the brands for under $2k.The only 3 things worth complaining about is you can't change aperture in Live View, however you can't do that in the D600 either. It isn't 100% viewfinder, which would be nice. Also the internal microphone is not that great but does have manual control. These 3 issues are not that big of a deal when considering what this camera does so well for its price range.Great camera, amazing capabilities, worth every penny.Video to Come later this week.Corey BenoitFaymus Mediafaymusmedia.comcorey@faymusmedia.com", "Date": "February 12, 2013"}, {"Title": "Finally, A Worthwhile Upgrade to the Nikon D3100 and D5100", "Author": "Ken", "ReviewID": "R33T5MT1Y9RZWG", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "Nikon has made some awfully good \"Entry Level\" Digital SLR cameras over the years.  The most recent were the D3100 and The D5100.  The main differences between the D3100 & D5100  was the D5100's articulating/brighter LCD and a bracketing feature.  The D5100 is about 10% heavier and costs a bit more than the D3100.  The D3200, the sucessor to the D3100, was released last year.  However the D3200 was arguably a step backward introducing a much higher resolution sensor (24MP) but at the undesirable cost of additional noise at higher ISO settings.The D5200 uses a 24MP sensor like the D3200 (although the sensors seem to be from different sources; the D5200 uses a Toshiba sensor while the D3200 uses a Sony sensor).  This time fortunately, the high ISO performance has actually improved. The D5200 body is almost identical to the D5100 camera body including the articulating, high resolution LCD.  The LCD screen now highlights settings for ISO sensitivity, Aperture size (F Stop setting) & Shutter speed making these settings very visible even at a glance.  The LCD layout is much better (and different) than anything Nikon has previously used.  Nikon does not include an LCD on the top of this camera (or on any of their smaller DSLRs) presumably due to physical surface area constraints.The key improvement is image quality. High ISO performance is actually improved despite the 50% increase in megapixels. ISO 1600 is almost indistinguishable from ISO 200.  ISO 3200 is very usable (but not really too far beyond that). Automatic White Balance for incandescent lighting, is still not great but has improved somewhat since the D5100 (but still not nearly as good as the older D5000); shooting raw is still really necessary to get the white balance right in artificial lighting (TIP: When shooting indoors, try \"Sunny\" instead of AWB). ISO settings can be incrementally increased between stops (ie ISO 2000) to help avoid using a higher than necessary ISO setting..JPGs are a little soft even after making in-camera adjustments; Shooting Raw and using Nikon's very good Image Editing software can enhance the photos quite a bit.  The built in flash is not great; an external speedlight with bounce capabilities is really essential for properly exposed photographs (or alternatively not using a flash at all and shooting at a higher ISO/slower shutter speed).  Like all modern DSLRs, 'live view' (LCD framing) can be used in lieu of the viewfinder.  However if you regularly prefer Live View to an optical viewfinder, probably the SONY offerings or even a compact system camera (ie the Olympus PEN series) is a better choice.The auto focus system on this (and almost every other Nikon SLR) is really, really good.  Unlike the Canon SLRs (including some very expensive ones), the Nikon uses an independent infrared auto focus beam that focuses instantly on any fixed object under all lighting conditions (even total darkness).  Try shooting in total darkness with any other camera series (except the 4th generation Olympus Pen) and the camera will simply refuse to auto-focus.  The Nikon D5200 (and almost all Nikon SLR cameras) focuses under such conditions effortlessly.This camera is expensive when compared to the current prices for the prior generation D5100 or D3100 which are both excellent cameras. Budget minded purchasers may want to give those cameras consideration or else wait for the inevitable price fall of the D5200.", "Date": "June 17, 2013"}, {"Title": "Outstanding for entry-level photographers!", "Author": "Torrell Booker", "ReviewID": "R2UGQE8YCJCQCZ", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I'm a beginner photographer and this is my first DSLR purchase.  I had been playing around in full manual mode on a Canon G15 point and shoot before buying this so the transition was relatively easy.  If you're having difficulty understanding what all of the numbers mean, the graphic display does a great job of graphically showing you what you're settings are.  Another great feature for beginners is that if you don't know what a menu option does, you can hit a button and it will describe what the menu option does, differences between the settings, and which situations the settings would be optimal for.You're probably reading this because you've looked at several entry-level DSLRs and are trying to figure out which you should purchase.  I was deciding between this camera and the D3200.  Why did I pick the D5200 over the D3200?Firstly, the D3200 is not capable of doing autobracketed shots, however the D5200 is.  You could manually bracket your shots, but it will take a lot longer and you run the risk of moving the camera or your tripod.  With the D5200, I can take three autobracketed shots in less than one second.  I do a lot of landscape photography so that is very handy!Next, from other reviews I read and watched (feel free to correct me) it sounded like the D5200 had a little better low-light performance.Lastly, I don't plan on purchasing another DSLR for at least a few years.  The D5200 is basic enough that I can learn, but advanced enough so that I can grow.  I wanted a camera that I'd be happy with for a while and this was a perfect buy.  It has all the features I'll need for a while.  I hope this helped.", "Date": "July 10, 2013"}, {"Title": "In between a good point and shoot camera and a professional camera", "Author": "Steve in Bozeman Montana", "ReviewID": "R351VI1XBF2Y80", "Overall": "3.0", "Content": "Updated November 25, 2013Professional camera reviewer Ken Rockwell suggests that the 5200 body for about $800 can do mostly everything the can be done by the D600 $2,000 body so why pay the difference for some extra dials and buttons?  I followed his advice and bought the D5200 and will keep it, but if a good used D600 body were offered for sale for $1,000 I'd gladly swap.  While I realize the camera can do a lot, the lack of easy control buttons and extra modes bugs me. It's a downsizing I know, but to have to hold down one button while activating another ... not intuitive after shooting for years with a larger more expensive D300.  Example:  somewhere along the line I was trying to adjust the aperture in A mode and apparently wound up sending the exposure compensator to +4.5, thus way over exposing my shots beyond any use.  This would not have happened with the additional dials and buttons on the more professional Nikon series. (My dog was happy to fetch another ball for another test.)The camera can indeed take great images.  After resetting the exposure compensator to zero I shot images of my dog running back with a ball.  In Aperture mode with aperture set at f4 the auto exposure system chose a 1/1,600 speed and the auto focus worked well;  the resulting image was very sharp, even for the eyes of the dog and the marks on the tennis ball in his mouth.As another reviewer noted, this camera's auto focus feature works with some, but not all, Nikon auto focus lenses.  For example, it works with my AF-S 70-200 and 18-200 lenses, but not with a 50mm Nikon auto focus AF lens nor with a Tamron auto focus lens that I own. That's understandable and should not be a problem for people buying new lenses.  Just be aware.This might be a good starter camera for someone who thinks he or she might grow into doing more creative photography than normally done with a simple point and shoot camera.The D5200 might also be a relatively inexpensive camera body for someone wanting to do fast moving sports photography; I've not tested the fast tracking feature, but it sounds great and the large number of megapixels should allow wider angle photos.  I.e., rather than zoom in on a galloping horse and perhaps later discover the nose is missing, one could take a wider photo of the horse and background to be sure all of the horse is in the photo and then in editing crop out the unwanted parts and still have a high resolution image of the entire horse.  To me that's a fairly significant advantage.The D5200 seems to me a great technological achievement in a compact plastic size. On the other hand, for about $1,000 for the D5200 and a compatible lens, perhaps most consumers (particularly those who won't be wanting to use various lenses)could do as well with a lower cost, more pocket size camera, while photographers who are used to a larger size camera with controls we can use without looking may find themselves a bit frustrated.It's a matter of fit between the buyer and the camera.  Good luck and have fun._______Nov 25 2013  I just returned from a month long trip on a large sailboat crossing the Atlantic Ocean.  Because weight and size were concerns in traveling, after debating I took only my D5200 with only my Nikon 18-200 VR lens.This worked well!  I used the weight saving to take my older larger laptop with my familiar LR and PS software;  accessing the \"cloud\" was mostly not possible / practical and I was glad I'd made this choice.I found the video mode surprisingly useful.  When I was at the helm of the huge sailboat, the person to whom I passed my D5200 camera could not quickly use it to shoot photos, so I put it in video mode and handed it back to her.  The video mode worked well in full automatic, allowing anyone who can point and shoot to create good memories.  The built in microphone picked up some wind noise, but that's to be expected on the deck of a moving sailboat.With days at sea, I began playing with the video and to push the limits.  I tried videoing flying fish which sometimes skimmed above the waves, which proved too difficult for the camera's autofocusing(at least in my hands).  However that was asking a lot - with the photographer sailing forward while also moving up and down from sideways swells, the background consisting entirely of waves in motion, and airborne fish briefly skimming in a different direction!  In another unfair test, I got acceptable results: Others on the boat had created a slideshow on a laptop using contributed photos and were attempting to record music to match the images.  I essentially had my D5200 look over their shoulders to video the laptop images while also capturing the music being played.  I instead of a tripod I used a bunch of masking tape to tape my camera to a brass rail to keep it stable relative to the subject (both gently rolling sideways at the same rate).  In this interior setting we would want the aperture to remain constant because only the music is changing.  However, the images on the laptop screen varied in brightness and the D5200 dutifully reacted, causing some unnatural changes in the overall result.  My unusual situation made clear why the camera must be in automatic aperture mode when producing video: to keep a relatively stable brightness for later viewers despite changing brightness when recording moving subjects.In another strange situation, which no one else should attempt, I risked ruining the camera by shooting it directly at the sun with no filter protection. I did so during a solar eclipse and only during the few seconds when the entire sun was blocked, with only the corona and solar flares being visible.  My images turned out to be better / more interesting than those taken by some scientists on board.  Luck sometimes triumphs over skill.In summary, the lightweight fairly compact D5200 can perform a variety of tasks.Another person also got surprisingly good images with a $250? point and shoot camera:  a Panasonic with a built in Leica lens which an on-board technical employee of Leica said was a quality lens.", "Date": "August 4, 2013"}, {"Title": "Great little Camera", "Author": "MrHarleyDavidson", "ReviewID": "R1P0SRG6EO5538", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "As a professional Photographer I have Nikon equipment.

Soon I wanted to upgrade from my (excellent but ageing) little Kodak point-and- shoot digital camera.  I began my research by visiting the larger electronic retailers to see the varieties and options available and deciding what kind of photos I might like to capture.  I like stills of family vacations, landscapes, group shots and stop action photos of grandkids but I NEED easy to operate.  I also want low light capability for \"No flash\" venues like museums. Over a six month span I gravitated to Nikon D series.  I asked myself, \"What are the minimal camera features I would need to satisfy my intentions?\" and \"If price is no object which version should I choose?\" I discovered the flexible view screen of D5100 would allow me to shoot from a low angle without hurting my arthritic back and knees. The discounted D3200 kit with two lenses was a tempting option for me but the testimonies of other reviewers stated that they liked their Nikon cameras so much that they later bought the next generation as well--not a prudent and economical strategy for me. Also, the lenses offered in the kits were entry level so I would surely later wish I had upgraded to the better Vibration Resistant lenses available.  My choice has been to purchase a D5200 black body separately instead of a kit with lenses. Then I selected two lenses more to my liking--Nikon 18-170mm VR to use as my \"Do-it-all\" lens and a Wide Angle lens for scenery and group photos.  No doubt I'll grow to want a portrait lens as well someday.

When I set the 2 second timer delay, it resets to single shot after every picture. Can Nikon create a firmware update so it stays in 2 second timer until turned off?2. Same condition applies when putting camera in the HDR mode. The camera reverts to normal after every picture taken. Can Nikon create a firmware update so that the camera stays in the HDR mode until manually turned back to normal picture settings.3 I shoot all RAW all the time. I understand because the special effects are processed that they have to be in JPEG. The issue is that when I want to shoot HDR I have to constantly go back to the menu and change to JPEG only. My question is: Can there be a Firmware Update that Can allow HDR be enabled when in RAW mode and then the camera only record JPEG as long as HDR is enabled? In addition can this be applied to all special effects. It is a pain to keep changing from RAW to JPEG every time I want to do a special effect.In the end I am constantly changing the settings of the camera and this takes a lot of time when I am shooting. It would be great to have a firmware update to correct this little flaws.On last item is that I shoot a lot of night shots with this camera. It is really great that the LCD is very bright to see during the day......but at night it is a glaring sun. Again I have to go back to the menu to change the brightness of the LCD. It would be nice if there was an ambient light sensor somewhere to automatically dim the LCD at night and then brighten it up during the day. This may not be a Firmware Fix. Just a note for future models.On the last item I found the menu to turn the \"Info\" off between pictures as not to blind me when shooting at night.So far so good with image quality and I am having good success with pictures so far.In general I am very happy with the camera.

Back focusing (the camera and/or lens focuses slightly farther than where you target) seems to be an epidemic problem among both Canon and Nikon SLR cameras.  It is a frequent cause of soft images.  This purchase has been very frustrating, because it is an otherwise wonderful camera.  A salesman told me that many photographers end up exchanging several times before getting a keeper. This seems like a ridiculous technological disparity--they've got a sensor that can capture an ingrown hair on a gnat's left buttock but the camera won't focus properly.  I was told that it's very hard to callibrate a camera to be accurate with all the lenses that are available....but if the problem is back focusing 90% of the time (which seems to be the case with numerous models--I've never heard of a problem with front focusing) why don't these guys start adjusting their products to compensate for that?UPDATEAfter shooting hundreds of test pics and comparing with the D7100 I've concluded that I was getting my drawers in a buch over nothing. The back focusing only seems to be a problem with extreme macro photography; the 1/8 inch inaccuracy does not interfere with sharpness under normal shooting conditions. Although the D7100 is slightly more accurate wide open at very close range, when taking a picture of a person at f/8 from across the room the sharpness is exacatly the same.

There are some features that are good about this 7100 that you normally only see on full framed cameras but the d 5200 has a few of these features as well. Yes, we would all like a d5200 to be weather sealed but eh can't always get what you want. The end result is the d 5200 is the best camera you can own for under $1000.00 us dollars.

Bloch \"BigdogNJ\"", "ReviewID": "RNMUP673X3DGS", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "Truth be told, I was looking to upgrade my Nikon D50 to an FX (full 35mm size image sensor) format camera when I began shopping for a new camera body. The price of those professional workhorses was unfortunately beyond my reach. I found this gem when I set my sights a little lower and I am very pleased with the outcome.The pixel count is extraordinary, yielding native 10x13 prints at 300dpi. The 11x17 prints I have made are beautiful, something I was unable to accomplish with the 6.1 megapixel D50.The camera is compact and lightweight almost to a fault. I know I'll appreciate this when traveling, but the \"feel\" of it is somewhat \"cheaper\" than I'm used to from Nikon.The vari-angle LCD panel is large and bright and provides easy access to the vast majority of camera settings when not in Live View mode. In Live View, it allows framing pictures at otherwise impossible angles. (I find the shutter lag in Live View disturbing and therefore use this mode only when absolutely necessary). I like the fact that the settings and menus are navigated by using buttons, the joypad and the dial rather than a touchscreen interface.The viewfinder is kind of off-center on the camera body and it took a little getting used to before I was able to automatically center my eye on it. Once that happened I found the screen bright and the framing accurate. The toggle-able grid lines are a very useful feature. The camera's exposure settings are clearly visible.The 39 point autofocus system is fast, flexible and accurate. The various exposure setting paradigms are remarkably accurate.The embedded technology is simply amazing. Along with the numerous scene programs the 5200 offers Active D-Lighting and High Dynamic Range (HDR) modes. Each of these post-processes the image to give dramatically better results in backlit and high contrast situations. The HDR mode actually takes two images at different exposures and combines them so that both highlight and shadow detail are properly exposed in the final image. There is a calculated multiple exposure mode plus a host of special effects and in camera image editing features.All in all, an excellent addition to the Nikon line for serious amateur and light professional photography.", "Date": "September 22, 2013"}, {"Title": "High Imaging Quality", "Author": "MagicMark", "ReviewID": "R2F36AO8M9PL3B", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "This camera, to my knowledge, has the highest quality of any camera that's under $2000 (see DXO Mark's scores.  It's even better than the D7100).  So far, I have enjoyed this camera and I intend to shoot some landscapes too.I have been using this camera for a little while now and I can say I really am impressed with the image quality.  I can shoot with higher ISO settings (ISO 640-2500 is common for me, even 3200 will do in a pinch) than I used to with my previous camera (Canon Xsi), which is a pretty good camera back in the day.I love the Picture Control function.  It allows me to customize my JPEG shots.  I shoot BOTH Raw and JPEG and use the JPEG format more often, mainly because I have already (with the Picture Control setting) made my image the way I want so I don't have to spend a lot of time in Photoshop trying to make the picture I envisioned in the first place.  Plus, you can customize the Picture Control settings exactly the way you want.And I this review would not be complete without a REASON for why, after 33 years with Canon, I switched to Nikon.  You see, I love in-camera special effects.  In fact, my favorite technique is multiple exposures.  But when I was 16 years old, Canon did not have a camera (for under $1000) that could do that.  So, I waited.  And I waited.  I waited 33 years and Canon still did not make one so I switched to Nikon.  This particular camera (D5200) has two different multiple exposure capabilities, one for JPEG (you can choose 2 or 3 exposures to overlap)and one for RAW.  The Raw one is interesting.  It lets you choose ANY two images on the memory card (they must be RAW format images) and you can control how bright each image will be in the final picture.  I LOVE my Nikon!Now of the not so good part.  There's always a down side to everything. And Nikon is no exception to that generalization either.  The only two flaws that I can see with this camera is 1) the battery life is short.  But this can be remedied by purchasing a battery grip (off brand names are inexpensive, under $100) and 2) the 18-55 kit lens that came with the body is pretty cheaply made (I recommend purchasing the body only and getting an independent lens, i.e. Tamron's 18-200mm zoom. It sells for under $200 here on Amazon).This camera is worth every penny!  Add to cart!:)", "Date": "September 20, 2013"}, {"Title": "OMG I love it.", "Author": "Garry D.

Aside from reading many comments on vendor sites, I read a lot of so called \u201cprofessional\u201d reviews and spec comparisons and would hope that others considering the D5200 do the same since this may not be a good fit for everyone so I will keep this short. It was not a deal breaker for me given the other specs, but I do wish Nikon would have added a touch screen. However it didn\u2019t take long to get used to all the settings/menu controls.  Build quality in my opinion is slightly better than the entry level Rebels I had, but am a little concerned about comments I have read about dust.  I suppose time will tell if this becomes a problem.  Video quality was better than I had expected and in my humble opinion pretty much equal to the Canon T4i.  The AF has been very quiet and not a problem with videos. AF on stills photos is more than fast enough for me and low light image quality has been very good to ISO 1600. Bokeh with the kit lens has been a mixed bag but with a prime lens (which I have on order) should be better. However, I do have a couple of images where I was really surprised how good the bokeh was with the kit lens.

Until I took a chance and bought this camera, I've only ever used Canons. I was actually looking to get a Canon 6D, then I checked out the specs, compared images and videos between the 6D and so many other cameras, and I went with the Nikon D5200 in the end. It really does capture an image with a slightly higher quality. It's subtle but significant. In terms of overall image quality alone, the only real advantage the Canon 6D has over the Nikon D5200 is the full-frame sensor's resolution, which does give you about 2x sensitivity to light as well. But full-frame DSLRs aren't right for everyone, and they incur extra expenses for more specific lenses as well.If you're after image-quality, video-quality, versatility, and affordability, I'd say this is the best DSLR you can get for under $1k USD. In fact, hands down, I truly believe this DSLR even has the best quality image you can get for under $2k USD.Again, I'm not a fanboy of Nikon or Canon or Sony or Pentax or anything. I've used a Toshiba VHS camcorder, a Sony point-and-shoot, a Panasonic Mini-DV camcorder, a Canon DSLR, a Kodak disposable, and anything else that worked well and made sense... I don't care what the brand is or how expensive or \"pro\" it is. All I care about it is: How good is the image quality, and is it designed well enough to easily master using it? The second point I can throw out the window if the image quality is that much better than it's competitors, but that isn't the case here either. It's a great camera all aroundPROS:1.5x crop sensor Vs. Canon's 1.6x (very close to a 35mm cinema camera crop-factor)6000 x 4000 resolution with 15.3 \u00b5m\u00b2 pixel size (Image is sharp, colors are detailed and very accurate!)921k dot LCD resolution which is more than you even need for the screen size.Shoots .NEF RAW... (Get the free plugin from Adobe if you use Photoshop or Lightroom)Battery lasts a very long time when not shooting (about 500 shots when shooting)30 second to 1/4000 of a second exposure range.Discrete built-in flash with multiple modes / Shoe for external flash24.2 bit color depth, 13.9 EV Dynamic range (tones are detailed, colors are rich and vivid!ISO can go up to 1200 in almost any scenario before getting noisyCompatible with almost all Nikon LensesHas a built-in help system, accessible on the fly, for every single feature and setting!Shoots HDR precomposed in camera or by bracketing multiple exposures to combine later.This baby can capture a crisp and beautiful image! The resolution is large enough, the dynamic range and color depth are wide enough, and the ISO efficiency is so good, I can take a low-light photo of a streetlamp at night, crop out a third of the image, blow it up to the original's size, and still have a crisp, clear, vivid, and noiseless image that I could print at 13x20 inches and hang on a wall, or sell at a gallery. The noise is so low, and the images are so sharp that you could easily blow up an un-cropped image to twice the captured size (26x40 inches) and it would still look fantastic.I was taken aback when I took this little guy out for it's first night shoot. Of course, a little know-how and some trial and error plays a role, but I was amazed by how accurately this sensor represents colors. I took a picture of some flowers in the immediate foreground against a backdrop of a park in the midground and a downtown strip in the far distance. Despite the street lighting, the moonlight, the neon signs, and all the little details in the store fronts, cars, trees, grass, benches, cobblestone walkway, and the telephone poll about a mile away... The picture I took was a spitting image of what I saw with my own eyes. Maybe even a little better. From the flowers in the foreground to the telephone poll far away, everything looked clean and clear and as it was in life. I was about 50 yards away from the storefronts with a 35mm lens, and I could still make out license plates in the photo. If I had focused to infinity, I probably could have made out the plates from even further away. Just as an example! That's not a regular habit or a hobby of mine. hahaha...CONS:Definitely not 100% intuitive menu settings... Read the manual before using to avoid possible confusion.ISO does not have it's own button/dial, however it's very easy to get used to using the \"function\" button for this.Menu system works well, but organization feels a bit chaotic and crammed in certain menu tabs.Nikon doesn't distinguish much between photography and videography. READ MANUAL to get familiar with all settings!Non-CPU manual lenses can only be used in Manual Mode. Would be nice to at least have auto ISO/Exposure as an option.The (BRONZE) paint job is not a matte finish like it looks in every photo you see. It's a glossy finish like the red version.PART 2 ~ THE LENSE:The Kit lens feels a little cheap compared more expensive lenses, but it actually performs very well. I used it a couple times and went immediately back to my primes though, but that's because I'm more comfortable with them. I don't know what to do with a zoom lense, so this was a great opportunity to get a pretty decent one to experiment with for a good price. For these reasons, I can't really comment on the lense that comes in the kit. All I know is it's much more highly praised than any other kit lense for this camera.

Too far out IMO.2. 1/4000th a tad slow.Above average functionality and great files are what make this a very good camera for my current use. For what the market seeks when looking at this sort of camera, it does very well. Even along side the best competitors, it easily holds its own IMO.Is it up for the task? Yes.Are the images it can produce pretty good (allowing for the skill behind the camera, and the lens in front)? - No, its not pretty good, its excellent overall.Will it make toast and tuck you in at night? Well if that was what you hoped for, you were looking in the wrong place anyhow.EDIT: Nikon updated the firmware today, and fixed the only real bug this camera suffers from.

I began using film SLRs back in 1965, but quit photography for a while when the last one broke down in the 1980s. I've been through a variety of small digital cameras starting in 2000, the last being a 4-megapixel Nikon Coolpix 4500 purchased in 2003 (for $529.95).I've taken at least 6,000 photos with the CP 4500 -- mostly macros of insects and spiders, since it can focus down to 0.7 inches, but also lots of bird shots. When the flash quit working on the CP 4500 early in 2013, I decided that it was time for something a bit more advanced. I did a lot of research online and settled on the D5200 with the 18-105mm zoom. We were heading out as far west as Tucson, AZ for our spring vacation, and I wanted more zoom than the usual 18-55mm kit lens for birding.The combination of D5200 and 18-105mm zoom worked out extremely well during our 3-week vacation, and I got hundreds of great shots. I've recently added the 85mm f/3.5 Micro-Nikkor for macro work and Nikon's 55-300mm zoom to get closer to the birds, and will be trying them out during a couple of weeks in Florida just after Christmas.I've been completely satisfied with the D5200 so far, and I like having an SLR with interchangeable lenses again. The flip-and-tilt LCD screen is one thing that influenced my decision. The CP 4500 had a twistable split-body that permitted taking shots of arthropods from lots of odd positions, and I wanted that flexibility, even though the D5200 will be too large to get in everywhere the CP 4500 will fit.Of course, things are a bit pricey nowadays. My first film SLR cost $59 (and didn't have auto-anything -- not even a built-in light meter), which is about 1/17th of what the D5200 cost, but then again I used to buy Levis for $2.95, and cameras have improved a whole lot more than blue jeans have.", "Date": "December 11, 2013"}, {"Title": "Saved lenses", "Author": "John Pollock", "ReviewID": "R1JFA1Q9X14BJ8", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "Upgraded to this camera from a D3000.

I tried a variety of lenses, but nothing could fix my lack of know-how. Eight wonderful D70 years did NOT prepare me for the D7k.  The fact that the d7k even HAS an Auto button is a JOKE. I had to shoot manually to get even half decent shots (although I have to say it was great for doing high speed shots of dogs leaping through the air)So a few months ago I craigslisted my D7000 - it pretty much covered a nice new D5200.The D5200 was a good move for me.  Even video became a possibility with the d5200 (quite difficult on the D7000 due to the awful fixed screen and the 24fps)The D5200 works nicely with my 50mm prime lens and with my old kit D7000 lens.  It even works well with my old D70 kit lens!!However it would seem that the skin color of pictures with the prime + D5200 seems off,bland,  and often a little overexposed.  But sometimes it's great. I have no idea, really.Anyway to sum up: good snapshots, easy to use all round.  LIGHTER than the D7k.  Good in low light. But for video? BEWARE! This isn't a camcorder!  The autofocus on my lenses in AF-F trying to track kids/dog/baby is awful.

I was very happy with my Canon T3i, my 1st DSLR but I am GLAD that I switched to this baby ;)!! In addition to the kit lens I added a 50mm 1.8g lens and Its a package that covers most of my basic photography needs.The performance, the auto-focus, the result, low light performance, and a massive 24 mega pixels give me enough room to crop/edit and still retain great image quality. I'm not much into movies but the movies are sharp and give great low light results as well. The AF in movie mode is something Im getting used to of of and in my opinion not better than the Canon t4i AF but still does a great job and the movie quality is quite superior to that of t4i, or even t5i maybe as that camera is almost identical to caonon t4i except some minor changes.If you're new to DSLRs, get this camera.

The sensor is amazing and especially helps for low light; the in-camera HDR works pretty well and can even be done without a tripod with a steady hand; I like how easy it is to toggle between video and still shots; you can even cut new start and end points on the camera to save memory on both your card and computer; and I like how you can either shoot through the viewfinder, use the screen for shot info, or in screen view. I was going back and forth between this and the D7000 and I selected a lighter, smaller camera body with the newer sensor, pixel size, toggle screen, easy video shooting over the durability, weather proofing of the D7000. Here are a few notes to keep in mind:-lens such as a simple 50mm without a motor built in will not autofocus on the D5200 (no in-camera motor). However, I found that using my f1.8 50mm indoors for a party was worth the manual focusing.-battery life of the en-el14 is really short -especially if you use the screen view. Always have a fully charged 2nd battery. If you are in the backcountry for a while without a solar charger, consider a 3rd battery.-one thing i miss is how easy it was on the d200 to toggle around your focal point. This is still possible but I can only figure out how to do that in screen view mode.That's all for now, still more to learn and I can't wait to test its full potential.", "Date": "March 17, 2013"},

It has good quality control, the ability to take very high resolution photos, a compact and relatively lightweight design, compatibility with many lenses, and many functions that are designed to improve photo quality in different settings.However, I noticed a major flaw that is highlighted in the attached video. There is a constant sound that comes from the camera in every video one shoots with it. In my video, I have quelled the sound significantly using some software. However, even after all of this effort, the sound is still present and can be heard alongside the crashing waves. This is a major flaw that causes the D5200's video quality to be considerably sub-par.I would like to stress that visually, all the images and videos have excellent quality. However, sound is a necessary component to a video.", "Date": "August 31, 2013"}, {"Title": "Great value for the $", "Author": "AZazel", "ReviewID": "R3NYEX8UQZ6ANN", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "Just upgraded from a D5100 and could not be happier.

My bundle featured the dove-tailing AF-S 18-55mm VR and 55-300mm VR lenses in a kit for my wife to keep her out of my Canon 60D bag that was kitted with Canon's 18-250mm IS. I'm not married to makes/models or I would not have bought this Nikon.  I don't get into the weeds on menu layouts, materials and other subjective items.  I rarely shoot video and offer no comments there.  This Nikon is otherwise a highly featured camera, especially with scene modes, making it nicely serviceable from new entrants to those who like full manual.  I very much like its very hi-res screen display.  My typical shooting is in the arena during Texas style barrel racing events demanding high shutter speeds and accurate tracking focus that freezes the dirt in mid-air.I shot the Nikon with its VR 18-55mm lens this morning side-by-side with the Canon 60D / 18-250mm knowing it is not an exact comparison; it's what I had available.  There are, however, reviews here extolling this Nikon over pro-sumer models, notably Canons.  The subject was flower blossoms and bees providing for both stationary and high speed shooting subjects.  The conditions were morning light with cloud cover shooting in Aperture, Shutter, Program and Macro modes with equivalent settings.  The 24MP Nikon operated well, but in NO WAY did it's bundled lenses compete with the 18MP 60D kit.The results were very much equivalent to my first DSLR ... a Rebel XT with Canon's earlier and much maligned 18-50mm EOS kit lens.  However, shooting with the Nikon VR 55-300mm lens was more satisfying.  It still doesn't match the Canon 60D combo, which comes at a $600-$800 price difference. I call it 'satisfactory'.  Its minimum focus distance is longer than Canon's 18-250 IS; about 5-6 ft.  If I could only buy a Nikon kit w/ one lens, the VR 55-300mm would be it, while searching for a different wide angle zoom.  At best, the VR 18-55mm might work well as a portrait lens when 'soft' is desired.  Overall, I cannot agree that this Nikon kit is the equivalent of higher end models. That said, it is otherwise so nicely feature laden that it could be the only camera you'll ever need when it is equipped with higher caliber lenses.I see nothing gained with a 24MP model over the Canon 60D 18MP, which produces sharper images as a kit shot for shot.

The sensor gets a very high rating from DXO Mark, eclipsing the D7100.  The viewfinder is ok.  Not great.  The auto-focus in low light conditions is abysmal.  It is a very very slow camera in low light, or when put into high resolution JPEG/RAW recording mode.  When the camera is in live view mode, it slows to a crawl.  Don't expect this camera to capture action indoors under many circumstances.  The battery life is good, but you can't use the full range Nikon lenses and expect the camera to work its magic.  You need at least a G-class lens, I think, for the auto-focus to work.  A Nikon D lens will not auto-focus on this body.  The full-auto mode renders acceptable images, but it freely records at ISO 3200 indoors even in relatively well lit environments, which brings some unnecessary noise into the images.  I think there are less expensive point and shoot cameras that would do a better job overall.In sum, I bought this camera body because I wanted a lighter, more compact, DX format body with higher resolution and image quality than a D7000.  What a TOTAL disappointment.  If you're a beginner, don't buy this camera.  There are many better choices out there.Update: Nikon has replaced the D5200 with a D5300 as of this week.

I have requested a return. After three days, I had dust visible and not cleanable, in the viewfinder- Menues and UI are very complicated relative to Canon and Sony DSLRs- AE lock not always successful- Some effects take forever to set up, such as B&W; with some colors excluded, will take 1-3 minutes to set up.- Location of the video record button is close to the shutter button, except you cannot use the viewfinder to video, only the LCD screen, for video. Therefore, all you videos are bump as you search for the button which is located somewhere totally useless and difficult to feel/find.- not able to record videos in 16:9 aspect ratio when every TV made in the last five years is 16:9- poor battery life (I got less than a 100 clicks and 3 minutes of video after a 24 hour charge)- cheap plastic build, including flimsy battery door- Price -given this is a glorified point and shoot- too many pixels -just a data hog- not enough camera.I wish my old Sony A-100 would take videos, and that it had better pixel count and better color accuracy. It is a lot easier to use, easier to hold, has longer batter life and better built -this camera is entirely plastic. I have dropped the Sony on solid rock several times but it has not affected it in anyway. With the D5200 you just have sense that it has to be held and placed on a table like you handle a 2 week old baby.I decided after the first day that given the high picture quality, I would live and master the poor UI and awkward button location for the video, and treat it like a precious child. It would be a price for high quality photography. However, when dust penetrated the camera after three days, I could not accept such a quality issue.I fell for Nikon as several of my photographer friends swore by the brand. In all fairness, they are all full size DSLR users. A journalist working for a local paper however told me that he switched to Canon 5 years ago, after 30+ years of being a Nikon fan, and has never looked back.I think I will go back to Sony, this time to A77.

It's a different mentality and user experience.Think of the DSR as a platform, for different lenses. In order to take advantage of its full potential, you need different lenses to attach to the platform body.The point and shoot has those built in. But, once you attach the correct lens to a DSR, then its magic will come out. It is a very precise platform, when attached to the correct lens, where as a P'n'S is not.I send mine back...they are coming out with a d7100, with better specs.\"Nikon has revealed a new enthusiast-level flagship DX-format camera, the 24.1-megapixel Nikon D7100. The much-awaited update to the aging D7000 has a professional-level 51-point AF system, and continuous full resolution shooting at 6 fps. Notably, the camera also does away with the optical low pass filter - meaning it should be able to capture sharper detail than cameras with a similar resolution.The Nikon D7100 has been given a specially designed DX-format (APS-C) 24.1-megapixel CMOS sensor (so not the same one employed in the D5200) which doesn't use the traditional optical low pass (anti-aliasing) filter found in most cameras. Nikon says this means it can produce sharper images that make the most of its resolution ... and presumably the firm is confident users won't suffer (too much) in terms of moir\u00e9 and aliasing artifacts.Autofocus is another area where Nikon has significantly improved the camera. The D7100 uses the Nikon Advanced Multi-CAM 3500DX autofocus sensor module, and employs the same algorithm used in the Nikon D4. This gives what Nikon describes as \"professional-level performance\" from the 51 focus points (15 cross-type sensors), including speedy subject acquisition, and phase-detection AF down to a minimum luminance of -2 EV (really dark conditions).Using an EXPEED 3 image processor, the new camera has an ISO sensitivity of 100-6400 (expandable to 25600) and can shoot full resolution images at a not-too-shabby 6 fps, though the buffer capacity is only good for six frames in full 14-bit RAW (or 33 frames in JPEG fine and large).Interestingly, Nikon has also introduced a new 1.3x crop function which crops images, giving an extra telephoto effect - and taking it to about double the 35mm-format focal length. This is likely to be welcomed by sports and wildlife shooters, who will also benefit from the way focus points cover a wider area of the cropped frame ... and the increase in continuous shooting speed, which goes up to 7 fps. Cropped images are 15.4 megapixelsOn the video side of things there's Full HD (1920 x 1080) recording at frame rates of up to 60i/50i and 30p/25p/24p. Dropping the resolution to 1280 x 720 gives users the option of 60p recording. Video recording can be based on the full DX-format or using the 1.3x crop (both in an aspect ratio of 16:9). While there's a stereo microphone, videographers will also be pleased to see an external microphone jack and headphone connector.There's a 3.2-inch LCD on the rear with 1,229k dots, while the 100 percent coverage optical viewfinder has been given an OLED display (for the information under the image) which is said to be very bright and have low power consumption.Measuring 5.3 x 4.2 x 3 inches (135.5 x 106.5 x 76 mm) and weighing 23.8 ounces (675 g) the D7100 features magnesium alloy top and rear covers in a durable body which is dust, weather and drop resistant. For those who prefer their cameras with a vertical grip, Nikon has also introduced the MB-D15, which adds the usual shutter-release button, AE/AF lock button, multi selector, and command dials. It can be powered either by six AA batteries or the standard D7100 batteryThough there's no built-in wireless capabilities, the Nikon D7100 is compatible with the optional WU-1a Mobile Adapter which allows users to transmit images wirelessly to an iOS or Android device, or to remotely control the camera.While the numbering of the Nikon D7100 shows it's an update to the D7000, it's also possibly the closest thing the D300s is going to get to a replacement. Nikon is choosing to refer to it as the \"flagship of Nikon's DX-format HD-SLR lineup\" and it's hard to see what the fabled D400 could add ... other than a larger full-metal body and faster continuous shooting with a bigger buffer.The Nikon D7100 will sell for US$1,200 body-only when it goes on sale in March, or $1,600 with the AF-S DX NIKKOR 18-105mm f/3.5-5.6G ED VR kit lens.\"I mean for $300 more, why not get a better one?

My only option is to send it back, which I really don't want to bother with-- I want to use the camera.  Anyway, bummer Amazon.  I'm not sure how you did this, but you sent me a screwed up D5200.And if i tried to buy the accessories from you, it would cost me $28.44.

The D5200 is a nice camera, but not a great camera and certainly produces no better pictures that a good point and shoot camera in side by side comparison , shooting the same scene in close sequence. Despite the multi point focusing, the pictures all show only a clear central area , while the periphery is uniformly out of focus. close up pictures are all black and not useable. Even in bright sunshine, the camera requires the flash about 40 per cent of the time. The D5200 is comfortable to hold and carry.  Overall, for general photography, i.e., family , sports and outdoor scenes, I would not find a reason to spend the money for this camera .", "Date": "June 29, 2013"}, {"Title": "only takes nikon AF-S AF-1 lenses", "Author": "rb maui", "ReviewID": "R2XNTANE295E9W", "Overall": "3.0", "Content": "I Just received the D5200 and found it does not work with any  of my off brand lenses.
