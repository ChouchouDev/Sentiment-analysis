{"Reviews": [{"Title": "If you want a \"cheap and cheerful\" waterproof camera, this one is great", "Author": "Eric Schurr", "ReviewID": "R8LVMC4QLOSBK", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "If you're looking for a simple point-and-shoot that you can take underwater, this camera is great.Let me begin by explaining that I am an avid photographer;  I have over $10,000 in high end DSLR equipment and lenses.  I have over 20,000 photos in my collection.  I know something about photography.I recently went on a sailing vacation with my family and wanted a simple digital camera to take in the water. I wasn't looking for something high-end because all i really wanted to do was shoot pics of my kids snorkeling and scuba diving.  I didn't want a disposable because they aren't digital, you usually have to wind them which is a real pain in the water, and they shoot poor pictures.  My wife bought me a $500 top-of-the-line underwater point-and-shoot Panasonic Lumix but I took it back because it was overkill.  It was waterproof to 40 feet, had an altimeter, etc --  I didn't need all that.  I found this Kodak camera and it was perfect.  It worked great -- we took on jet skis, on snorkeling trips, and down to 11 feet underwater scuba diving.  It never had an issue -- it started up quickly, operated simply and reliably, and the photos are just fine. Frankly, the videos are even better -- I was surprised at good they are!  Of course, the photos don't compare to my $2,000 Nikon DSLR, but I wasn't expecting them to.  I just wanted a camera that could capture some of the memories of the water fun on our sailing trip, and this did it.", "Date": "July 10, 2011"}, {"Title": "Performed Flawlessly Underwater during 8 Day Maui Trip", "Author": "W.

Kai)- not the nicest reef by far, but this video should demonstrate the camera's surprisingly good capabilities, especially considering the low price.  It was late afternoon and the water was a bit murky, and I was surprised how well the video came out.  I have uploaded the raw avi file (66.9 MB; 44 seconds).  This camera shoots VGA (640x480).  Amazon processing reduced the resolution and quality, although it still looks fairly faithful to what I uploaded.  Although I read reports of this camera failing rapidly underwater, ours did not present any problems after spending many hours underwater.  It appears just about all the underwater cameras have about a 10-20 per cent failure rate based on rates in reviews here on Amazon.  So, I decided not to risk $200-300 on a more expensive underwater camera, as they seemed no more reliable.  The camera is fixed focus but seems to have enough depth of field to present sharp pictures.  Note that the fixed focus offers an advantage with snapshots - shutter delay is VERY short.", "Date": "July 22, 2011"}, {"Title": "nice camera for the price!", "Author": "willie \"roadie\"", "ReviewID": "R3OUOCF7JASC5Q", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "UPDATE: Kodak's bankruptcy and exit from the digital camera business probably means that these cameras will be gone forever! I have the updated C135 in pre-order, but I'm not holding my breath. Amazon says it's 'unavailable,' but my account's order status has the C135 shipping in April. Who knows? All I know is that I'm glad I own a backup C123 in the box. The C135 is supposed to have digital stabilization, as opposed to no image stabilization in the C123 - but the C123 still takes great pics for its intended purpose.although it's more orange than red, i like my new c123... i carefully read every review, and although i can understand why some folks are disappointed, i am more than happy with this camera after playing with it, taking indoor, outdoor, and yes, even close-up shots!the controls are fairly intuitive, but i found that i had to set up the camera before it would take acceptable pictures (specifically, the 'sharp' selection under 'Sharpness' on the Capture menu; you may also want to manually select an ISO if you're going to be in the same lighting conditions for your picture session - see below)this camera works with my version of iPhoto on an older iMac, so i'm grateful - the kodak setup was fairly easy: plug in the camera, turn it on, install the resulting kodak.pkg from the Desktop, etc. ... i use 'Other Application' for the 'Computer Connection' item under the Setup menu...UPDATE: i have since found that there is no reason to use any Kodak software with my C123 and iPhoto, since iPhoto recognizes the C123 and imports pictures with no problems - and especially since i can (if i wish) send iPhoto pics straight to facebook if desired (something i rarely do)this camera's firmware is deceptively sophisticated, but honestly, these were all the initial settings i used...you *will* have to hold this camera steady! it does NOT have 'shake reduction' featured in most higher-end cameras...that said, anyone who knows photography knows that it's not the camera that makes the best pictures, but the photographer's eye (and to a degree, technique)i was a bit apprehensive about the lack of macro shots, but tried a 24\" flash pic of some stuff on my desk - the picture came out perfectly sharp and acceptable, considering this is an inexpensive camerai next tried to take pictures indoors, with no flash, use the digital zoom about a third out... first, i tried the 'Auto' ISO mode; next, i set the camera to ISO 80... carefully bracing the camera, i squeezed off one shot each of a stack of books about 20 feet away in the living room...the results were as i expected: the ISO 80 picture was noticeably 'sharper'... so there is a some manual control available to the picture taker...i have no intention of going snorkeling with this camera, but wanted something that will be impervious to dust, dirt, or sand at the beach - in this regard, this little kodak will fit the bill perfectly... it's compact, uses AAs, has simple controls, tripod socket, and accepts an SD or SDHC card (although it did not like my 16GB Adata, but worked fine w/a 4GB microSDHC in an SDHC carrier taken straight from my Canon A570is and stuck in - even the Canon's pictures showed up under the C123's preview! w00t!)five stars for this camera for me - i look forward to an improved model or firmware... i also recommend going to kodak's web site to get the 'extended c123 user guide' - there are more hints and tips in the manual", "Date": "June 14, 2011"}, {"Title": "Great camera for the price!", "Author": "Teachermom", "ReviewID": "R1IXFITHCXE13S", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "We recently purchased this camera for our Disney Cruise.

can re-use and not have to worry about getting wet.Takes great pics in/under the water and you can also record videos (no zoom when in video mode).When turning on it is ready to take pictures very quickly.So far it has not eaten batteries, which is good because it does not appear to turn off automatically.Has other modes if you want to use the camera for more than taking pictures in the water but we have not really tried them out.ETA:Soon, I am going to attempt to upload a video taken in our pool.  Also, wanted to add one great thing about this camera - we left it out side overnight and it rained.  It was really a relief to know that my camera didnt get ruined simply because I forgot to bring it in after swimming!Kids are having a great time using this camera, so much so I may have to go ahead and pick up a 2nd one!  It is really holding up to being roughly handled.added a very short clip of my dog.  my son uses the camera 1st above the water then underneath and then above again. I have also noticed that when in video mode, the camera is picking up sound underwater!  it's pretty cool, I wasn't expecting that.", "Date": "May 31, 2011"}, {"Title": "Extreme Surprised!!", "Author": "TashaPhD", "ReviewID": "R2APQYEHVMC1RP", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I was truly blown away by the picture quality!  I just printed some of the pictures and they look way better than I anticipated from a waterproof camera - insanely inexpensive at that.  I kept the camera submerged for long periods of time and I never noticed any sort of leakage.  My vacation would not have been complete without it...serious!Only drawback is the speed at which you can take multiple pictures in repetition.  The screen takes a second to process the photo so you have to wait a few seconds to take another picture.", "Date": "June 1, 2011"}, {"Title": "Unbelievable value", "Author": "Herb", "ReviewID": "R2WV0DCG3C4VMN", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I purchased this last minute from another retailer for a trip to the Cayman Islands where I knew we would be doing extensive snorkeling. In the past, I have rented underwater cameras while there or used disposable cameras and had the photos developed. I couldn't believe the quality of the pictures considering the price of the camera.I agree with some of the other reviewers in that it is difficult to see the screen when it is bright out. I found that setting the LCD brightness to maximum helped to relieve this but I still had to be at the correct angle to see it clearly. Like all compact UW cameras, the flash is fairly ineffective due to back-scatter unless the water is crystal clear or the subject is within a foot or so of the camera.Regardless, i can't recommend this highly enough. While some of the adjustments are limited, from an underwater camera standpoint, this is a deal that can't be beat. I think that it compares favorably with the low end Fuji camera at about half the price. I think one of the best things is that it uses AA batteries and sips them at that. I was averaging about 140 shots per day (50% with flash) with camera on and ready to shoot (read screen on and active) for at least a 3 to 4 hours hours a day and two alkaline AA batteries would last about 2 days. I will test with NiMH and update the review later. I was also able to exceed the depth limitation and still take pictures but YMMV (I took several pictures at around 15 ft.).Most of the modes work reasonably well for a cheap Point and Shoot camera. Obviously, it is not a DSLR (or even advanced P&S;) but still highly serviceable. My only complaint in this area is that in UW mode the camera caused a greenish cast on most all pictures. It would be nice to be able to set white balance manually to avoid this but it was a simple fix with Photoshop Elements (I would imagine that it is simple with other photo editors, too).If you are planning a vacation where you will be taking underwater photos in shallow water, buy one of these. Basically, you can buy this camera for the cost of 2 disposable 35mm UW cameras and photo processing fees and you will be able to use the camera again and again.Update:One other issue/nice to have is close focus (I think that other reviewers may have mentioned this). Once you are closer than about 12\" focus becomes iffy. Some times it works, some times it doesn't. It would be nice to have a dedicated macro mode but I am still exceedingly happy with my purchase.", "Date": "June 12, 2011"}, {"Title": "Frustrated!", "Author": "2cms", "ReviewID": "R3IXMV3Y9SZ1Y3", "Overall": "1.0", "Content": "I bought this camera specifically for a trip to Cabo.

I have never written a review on Amazon but was moved to do so by my experience with this camera. I was able to access the pictures from my card after drying it but the camera is now worthless. This camera may be okay if you treat it as \"water resistant\" but I would not submerge it.", "Date": "June 29, 2011"}, {"Title": "Great Camera for the Price", "Author": "Jeff", "ReviewID": "R1Y54Y60T034K8", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "I bought this camera for our honeymoon to Hawaii intending on abusing it in the ocean, and did just that. We used the camera for underwater pictures, video, and even for a lot of normal pictures out and about. Having given the camera a hard drive, here is my honest feed back:Cost - This camera is a great price in comparison to other underwater digital cameras, which you really have to want to invest in. We already have a number of cameras, and specifically got this just for water photos. If you want a camera for the rest of your life that may take pictures in and out of water, you might want to consider investing is something a little higher in quality, but for getting a majority of your underwater shots, invest in this camera over disposables. Trust me, it's worth it!Underwater picture quality - We took a lot of video and pictures while snorkeling, and the pictures for the most part turned out amazing. Don't get me wrong, some are dark and some are blurry... but most of the pictures, and especially the videos actually turned out really nice. One important point, the lense is fixed. Therefore, the lense does not move in and out when zooming. I noticed that the more you zoom, the less quality the picture is. Just something to keep in mind.Water-proofing - We did not have a single problem with this. We took the camera in the ocean, a waterfall, and in the pool, and not once did we have water get into the camera. Take care of the camera and make sure the doors/seals are closed, and this camera will handle the water well.Finally, one last point is on the lense fogging. This DOES happen when getting in and out of water (mostly with temperature changes). The fastest way I found to defog the lense is turn it off, and then place the lense in direct sunlight. The fogging will disappear in a few minutes.I know this is too long, but in summary - The camera is a great choice for someone that wants much higher quality than disposable cameras, wants to take underwater pictures, and has another camera for the rest of your high quality day-to-day pictures (aka not in the water). If you want an all around high quality camera for in and out of water, maybe looking into getting a more expensive waterproof.", "Date": "September 7, 2011"}, {"Title": "Very nice for the price", "Author": "Shania", "ReviewID": "R3ND6YFGJLB0I9", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "I bought this camera for my 15 year old son who is taking a 2 week hiking trip.  He hasn't actually taken the trip yet, but he's been playing around with the camera (we both have, actually) at home to get comfortable with its features and abilities.  Considering the price, I am actually quite impressed.  Aside from the price, there are two reasons I choose this camera.  First, it is waterproof (to 10 feet)and could therefore withstand getting dropped in a puddle or rained on. The waterproof feature just takes that type of worry out of the equation.  My son is also a competitive swimmer, so I fully expect he will at some point also enjoy it in the pool with his friends.  The second reason for choosing this camera was the \"easy share\" of the pictures.  You set up emails or a facebook account in advance, then as you take the pictures you choose where you will share them (email, facebook).  To actually share them, you will need to plug into a computer, but then it will automatically and quickly send those pictures to wherever you have designated.  (Hint:  you need to designate an email to send from and a yahoo or gmail account are the easiest to use to set up... techies may know more, but this worked best for me).  The biggest suprise was the pictures themselves.  The quality is actually not bad.  Professional photographers and photo enthusiasts of course would not be satisfied, but for a 15 year old boy or me, this works pretty good.  Settings for lighting, etc. are available and are pretty simple to use.  Video is good in good lighting.  Lighting is probably the key to all, but we haven't had any problems so far with any light (assuming use of the flash in poor lighting).  Things that I would like to see would be the ability to associate with more than one facebook account at a time and a view finder so that you could see what you were doing in bright sunlight, but these are minor disadvantages.  Given the price, this is really a very nice camera and will serve our purposes very well.", "Date": "May 25, 2011"}, {"Title": "fun camera -", "Author": "Picture Happy", "ReviewID": "R2XV1K0N44V5EZ", "Overall": "3.0", "Content": "Fun camera - we bought it in May and it is now July and water is starting to seep into the camera with each use.

snorkling with the sting rays in Great Turk (see video). I was considering getting a waterproof case for my \"good\" camera but didn't want to risk ANY leakages thus ruining the entire camera.I bought this for $61 w/Free shipping from Amazon and got it quickly, tried it in my pool 1st and worked great. It felt weird putting it in water at first since it looks like a land digital camera. It was fantastic and easy to use. As a matter of fact I started to use it on land on vacation as well because the pictures were all sharp and clear. There are land and water settings for video as well as special \"scenes\" which I tried and found to work great as well. I bought a long lanyard to hang it off of my neck while snorkeling (the wrist strap is not practical).The only negative thing which was not a factor for disliking this camera was that it is a little hard to see the screen and controls when underwater, but if you take a few minutes to familiarize yourself with the settings it is not that big of a deal. Aim the camera to what you want to take pictures of.. it's digital so shoot a lot! The color may shift a bit if sun glare gets in lense, not often though. I bought an inexpensive cloth case at a local store to protect the lense which does not have a cover.People.. if the camera leaks at all, it means it is defective and just return it for another one! Do test it BEFORE you actually need it to see how it works. I've shown many people all my photos and videos at work and wished I could get some commission for how many were purchased because of that. This camera totally met all of my expectations.", "Date": "July 27, 2011"}, {"Title": "Very good camera for the price", "Author": "Robert Williams", "ReviewID": "R3VXPYA85BJHHP", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I received this camera the other day.

We use it every time we are at the pool, have taken it to the lake, and on a float trip.  I have not experienced the lack of \"waterproofness\" that a couple of reviews did.

All in all, this camera should NOT replace your other cameras.  Take it for what it is... a fun addition to summer and water.  And in this day and age, it is super easy to return a broken product, so even with the couple complaints, it is still worth buying... in MY opinion ;)", "Date": "June 20, 2011"}, {"Title": "A very fun little camera with a few drawbacks", "Author": "Becki Robins \"Mother of Four\"", "ReviewID": "R3UXD5KKD2SSLA", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "I bought this camera after spending what seemed like hours researching options for underwater photography. I have a fairly expensive Nikon DSLR and another less expensive Nikon DSLR, which is the one I usually take with me to the beach or the pool. Still, even with the less expensive camera I have to be very careful to keep sand out of it, and I can't get in the water or very close to my subjects if they are in the water.I originally planned to buy an underwater housing for my less expensive camera, but I was more than a little bothered by the fact that there wasn't a single product available that didn't have one or more reviews claiming that the housing had completely failed and ruined an expensive camera. Furthermore, when this happens the company that makes the housing usually pays for a replacement of the housing, not the camera. I wasn't willing to take this kind of risk even with my less expensive camera, which would still cost upwards of $500 to replace.Then I found this little camera on Amazon.com. I really liked the idea of a cheap camera that could go underwater. If this one failed (and it sounds like about 20% of all underwater cameras, regardless of the price, do eventually develop leaks) I was out $67, and unless it failed right away it would still pay for itself, since a few underwater disposables are roughly equal to the price of this camera.I am mostly happy with my purchase. It's so much fun to be able to go out in the water with my kids and take pictures of them underwater, or splashing around and having a good time. I would never be able to get pictures like this with either of my other cameras. Even with an underwater housing, I think I would be too scared to really let go and go all the way underwater with it. With this camera I don't worry. I just go out and shoot. I can even swim with it in my hand (mine came with a floating wristband--I wouldn't recommend doing this if you don't have one because the camera doesn't float).There are three issues that made me downgrade the camera from a five star to a four star, at least two of which have been mentioned by other reviewers.1) The screen is really hard to see in bright light, and there's no viewfinder, so sometimes it's hard to know what you're shooting at.2) The shutter is slow. I'd say it takes a full two seconds from the time you press the button to the time the photo is actually captured. So you may miss some action unless you shoot about two seconds before something happens, which obviously isn't always possible.3) (And I'm surprised I haven't read any other reviews complaining about this) The camera really tends to blow out highlights, especially when you are in the water on a bright day. I actually sent my first EasyShare Sport back to Amazon.com because the problem was so bad that I couldn't get a good picture of someone just standing in my driveway after 2pm on a sunny day. The second one is much better, but the highlights are still blown in about 65% of my water shots, which is kind of annoying. I think the reflection off the water is the main culprit, so I'm not sure that much can be done although next time I will try using the exposure compensation feature when I go in the water on a bright day.In every other situation, thought, the camera works great. I got some fantastic pictures of my kids underwater at the indoor pool. Outdoor \"dry\" shots are pretty good, too. The overall photo quality is not awesome, but unless you're looking for blue ribbons or you print a lot of images at 8x10 or greater, I don't think you're really going to notice. And don't forget that without this camera (or one like it) you wouldn't have these underwater/in water photos at all, so a few blown highlights are really not a big deal compared to missing all those great shots altogether.", "Date": "September 5, 2011"}, {"Title": "Kodak Water Camera FAILED", "Author": "Javier", "ReviewID": "R1FCEWB60ISXNX", "Overall": "1.0", "Content": "Purchased this less than one month ago to take snorkeling in Mexico.

I feel there's nothing particularly wrong with this camera except the fact that they claim its waterproof.  I bought this for my 9 year old son.  Both he and I were able to take some decent pictures.  But when we got into the water, it didn't even last 1 day in a 6ft pool.  I handled the camera most of the time and the underwater pictures where pretty good.  I put the camera away for a few hours and when I took it out again...DEAD.  No power and there was visible water inside the screen.  When I opened the battery compartment...wet.  For the money I was not too upset and it was also within 30 days of purchase so I returned it (Gotta love Amazon!)When inspecting the camera (I work with a bunch of mechanical engineers so it was inevitable that I was going try to find out what went wrong), I feel it is pretty poorly designed.  Especially the battery compartment.  There are two locking mechanisms, one to cover the batteries/SD card and one to cover the entire battery compartment.  In theory this is a good idea, however when the first mechanism is locked, a small sliver of the battery compartment is visible.  When closing the 2nd locking mechanism (the one for the entire battery compartment) there is a small gap (nothing visible) however there is also a black rubber gasket which I assumed would keep the water out.  I guess I assumed wrong.Overall, I would say that Kodak should advertise this camera as water RESISTANT because I took some great shots in the pool waterfall and great videos down the waterslide, but I think when I fully submerged the camera to take the underwater videos I signed its death warrant.  It would be good in the rain or possibly for some near surface shots.  If you take a chance on this camera I would not submerge it for longer than a few seconds.I hope this helps someone.", "Date": "July 26, 2011"}, {"Title": "Not water proof", "Author": "J.

I know that helps keeps costs low, but when you are primarily using this camera for outdoors, that is an issue. Second, it doesn't have a rechargeable battery... again, a cost saving measure for the manufacturer.

One thing I noticed immediately is that it burns battery power fast. I was able to make around 20-30 shots when the power became low. As a workaround (because I have heard about this issue before), I bought 4 rechargeable batteries and brought them with me every time.It works great, except that it can be tricky to alter the options to maximize its photo-capturing potential. During night-time, even when there are bright lights, you still get photos that have lots of noise (average camera users should be able to understand this). The truth is that 12MP does not matter at all. Some say the photos are \"pixelated\" (or shows large pixels), but those are not pixels, those are noises. Anyhow, with a good picture editor, you can manage to reduce the noise, but that only means there is a need for post-processing of pictures taken during the night (or late in the afternoon or wherever the light is not as bright as the sun).It works underwater -- yes. There is no time-limit to it, only depth limit. As long as you won't be using this camera for diving, just for swimming or snorkeling, it would work great. My suggestion is that you try both the underwater photo-capturing option and the auto-settings (not underwater). Sometimes one takes better pictures than the other option. There is no way to alter the lighting or other options when in video mode, though. Just one setting (which does not fit all!)However, I have one problem with this camera. The small black sliding compartment lock under the camera (for batteries) has been stuck because of sand. We frequent beaches and the sand managed to stick to the sliding lock, making it hard for us to open the battery compartment. After we were able to remove the sand, we noticed that the metal (or spring or whatever) of the compartment door itself has some rust (this part is beneath the black rubber of the compartment door). Sea water must have penetrated. This made it hard for me to open the battery compartment door ever since.But still, the camera is still working. It still works great underwater. No water penetrates.

This camera got good reviews regarding its operation and the pictures, etc....and so given the price, I figured I'd give it a shot. I usually buy items on Amazon using the customer reviews.  Seems to be the best way to REALLY tell how a product is.  This was no different.  After reading the 5 and 4 star reviews, it seemed like a good buy.  EXCEPT, that nearly ALL of the 1-star reviews was because the thing leaked...and leaked in far less water than the advertised depth... and quickly.  Given the total reviews and given the total 1-star reviews, I estimated that I had about a 4 out of 5 chance that I'd get a unit that didn't leak...and if that was the case...it would be a good buy (20% of the total reviews were 1-star, and every one of the many I read of the 1-star reviews, was because it leaked).And so in the end, I wasn't so lucky.  Used it in a 4ft pool (so no way the depth was exceeded).  I'm an Engineer for the Navy (Submarines), and I'm very aware how/why things leak.  I'm a designer of underwater electronics.  I checked this thing out fully prior to immersion in water.  Everything was as it should be (with respect to the seals that the user has access to).  But it leaked in about 15 minutes of use.Looking at its construction, while the battery compartment has a rubber cover, the rubber cover doesn't extend to a seam where the front assembly meets the battery compartment.  This, in my opinion, is the likely water path.  And it looks to be a DESIGN issue.  I'm sure they have something in there as a water-block, but it doesn't look like it to me.In my somewhat expert opinion about an item designed to operate underwater, I believe the design is flawed, and you will have about a 20% or more likelihood that the item will leak if used underwater, and probably a much higher likelihood if used underwater often.My guess is it's probably ok to buy if you want to use it in the rain, etc.  But as an underwater camera, don't bother with this one.", "Date": "June 29, 2013"}, {"Title": "Great, versatile, waterproof camera for the price.", "Author": "Frederick J.

I love taking great pictures and over the years I had many cameras. I purchased and returned so many cameras I lost count. I hate when you buy a camera and the reviews are OUTSTANDING and then you take it for a ride in different occasions and environments only to be disappointed by the end results. So with that said I, I was looking for a water camera and after reading many reviews I decided to buy this camera from my nearest Walmart. I thought, here is going to be another camera with great reviews that's going to go back in few weeks. I WAS SO AMAZED OF THE QUALITY OF THE PICTURES, I WENT BACK A WEEK LATER AND PURCHASED ANOTHER ONE JUST IN CASE IF ANYTHING EVER HAPPENED TO THE FIRST,I WANTED TO MAY SURE I WILL HAVE ONE MORE AS A BACK UP:):):) I HAD NEVER DONE THAT BEFORE WITH ANY OTHER CAMERA, EVER! Now,keep in mind that I'm not easily impressed when it comes to cameras, but this one blew my mind. Let's be clear, this is NOT a great camera for all occasions and I didn't intend to use as such from the beginning, but for a water camera THIS CAMERA IS THE BEST, HANDS DOWN! I LOVE IT!!! The colors are vibrant, quality it's outstanding + the price it's awesome. I had it for the past 3 summers and I captured so many great moments of my kids at the pool, recorded many videos,and so far I had not one problem with this camera. Few things I would like to mention:1. when you review your video on the camera the sound DOES NOT WORK, ONLY WHEN YOU VIEW IT ON YOUR COMPUTER OR OTHER DEVICE YOU CAN HEAR THE SOUND.2. the screen it's a bit small but believe me you'll love how the pictures look on a bigger screen.2. I love the idea or rechargeable batteries, I bought few extra batteries and a charger and have them with me at all times.3. make sure you take out the batteries when you don't use the camera for long periods of time.IF YOU'RE HESITANT ABOUT PURCHASING THIS CAMERA, TAKE IT FROM A PICKY PERSON: YOU'LL LOVE IT, AND IF YOU HAVE KIDS YOU'LL LOVE IT EVEN MORE. I WAS STOPPED SO MANY TIMES AND ASKED ABOUT IT. NOT ONLY THAT I WAS IMPRESSED, BUT MY FRIENDS WERE IMPRESSED TOO, THEY ALL THANKED ME FOR CAPTURING SUCH GREAT MOMENTS ON CAMERA... SINCE I WAS THE ONLY ONE WITH THE CAMERA IN THE WATER :) I'LL TRY TO SEE IF I CAN UPLOAD SOME PICTURES.P.S. few month ago my everyday point-and-shoot camera broke and I started searching for another camera to replace my broken one. I purchased two cameras that I'm trying out right now, bought and returned 3 others so far...IF THAT'S NOT A PICKY PERSON, I DON'T KNOW WHAT OTHER WORD WILL DESCRIBE ME BETTER. So far I think I found a winner: PANASONIC DMC-ZS19! (I BOUGHT THE ZS19 AND ZS20 AND SO FAR IT LOOKS LIKE ZS 19 IS BETTER, I MIGHT WRITE A REVIEW ON THAT TOO) I JUST MENTIONED ALL THIS TO SHOW YOU THAT I DON'T JUST BUY ANY CAMERA UNLESS I TEST IT MYSELF.

We bought this just for a trip to British Virgin Islands where we knew we would be snorkeling and hiking a lot.  The photo quality is adequate especially considering the price.  We also took along our old Canon elph 6mp which I think creates a better quality photo, even though this one is claiming 12mp.  Any zooming on a good size computer screen will show pixelation.It is rugged.  We had total freedom when hiking around The Baths where it was bumped into rocks and was tossed between group members.  I never worried about it.It never leaked a drop and takes the same good quality pictures today, even after multiple excursions 25ft down to reefs, drops onto rocks, and swinging from a hiking bag.I was surprised to see how the freedom from protecting the camera showed up in our photos and videos.  Waves crashing into The Baths in Virgin Gorda were caught mid flight and up close.  A sting ray spotted from the beach is caught when I run into the surf and dunk the camera down for an underwater shot of him.  I would not even think of carrying my other camera for a wading session in the surf.  We spotted a nurse shark while snorkeling and take a shot.I briefly missed having advanced shutter control when longer exposure was needed once.Keep your expectations relevant to the price and features and you won't be disappointed.It zooms but not very well.  I believe it is an all digital zoom.The H2O functions seemed to add too much yellow for the water colors in BVI.  We used it on Auto most of the time and it always recognized faces when present.  Underwater video was really a treat when we discovered the odd sounds you can pick up on the recordings.We needed a bigger memory card.  Be sure to get a good sized card, because you will take this camera everywhere and therefore take a lot of pictures and videos.We had some trouble seeing the screen in bright situations, again you kinda get what you pay for.Overall we were satisfied that photo quality was adequate for recording our vacation and posting to social sites.  Just being free from worry about carrying a high dollar item allowed us to more completely record our memories when we otherwise would not have.  So even if you decide to go big on the budget and get a high dollar camera, pickup one of these lug everywhere anyway.

did everything it promised. Attached is a video of a jellyfish I took while snorkeling in Key West. The day was overcast so lighting was low - it's not the camera's fault.The only \"negative\" is the camera does not have optical zoom. It has digital zoom, but digital zoom is, in my opinion, worthless. But if it had optical zoom, is waterproof to 10 feet, and is 12MP, it wouldn't be under $70, would it?", "Date": "December 27, 2011"}, {"Title": "Very glad I got this instead of a disposable waterproof camera!", "Author": "bluebug83", "ReviewID": "R2DARRB4SRSV9Q", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I originally purchased two disposable waterproof cameras to take along snorkeling on our trip to Hawaii. But I then decided to check and see if there were any digital alternatives for an underwater camera.  An underwater housing for my Canon G11 cost roughly $180 and wasn't guaranteed to not leak, which wasn't worth it to me.  Then I found the Kodak C123 Sport.  After the cost of the two disposable cameras and film development, the Kodak didn't cost a whole lot more, so I decided to buy it and try it out.Before we left on vacation, I played around with the camera, taking pictures and videos (and playing them back) with it submerged in a bowl or sink of water for an hour or two at a time.  It performed great, and I never had any problems with leakage.  So I returned the two disposable cameras I had bought, and packed the Kodak C123 in my suitcase.The camera performed great on our vacation in Hawaii.  Pictures were certainly comparable to, if not better, than anything a disposable would take.  This camera also takes video with sound.  I had a lot of fun with the camera, and took videos of snorkeling around the reef, boogie boarding, wave crashing on to shore over the camera, etc.  As with my home tests, I never had a problem with the camera leaking or shorting out from the water.  While talking to another couple on one of our snorkeling trips, I showed them my camera, and they said they wished they would have known about it and bought something like that instead of a disposable camera.  We never took it any deeper than about 10 feet, its advertised limit.I found battery life to be much better than indicated in other reviews - I didn't have to change the first set of batteries after, by my rough estimate, 5 or so hours of on-and-off use (frequent cycles of turning the camera on to take pictures or a video and play them back, then shutting it off for a few minutes, then turning it back on again when we saw something else interesting, etc).The camera has a few manual settings available - such as manual ISO adjustment (as well as an auto ISO mode), underwater vs. standard mode, and various scenes tailored to shooting above ground.  I found some pictures taken above water in the sunlight to be too bright and washed out, but that may have been due to me not using the correct setting.  I noticed at one of our snorkel locations that I seemed to get better underwater results using \"auto\" mode instead of \"underwater\" (and the opposite at a different snorkel location), so I would recommend trying both modes and seeing what works best.Photo quality is certainly not on par with that of my Canon G11 - nor did I expect it to be - but it is a great camera for the price point, especially due to its underwater capability. I think that 12 megapixels is too large an image size for this camera, especially since it only has digital zoom due to the ability to use it underwater.  I wouldn't recommend using the digital zoom too much since the image loses quality very quickly, especially at a 12 megapixel resolution.Overall, this is an excellent camera for its price point if you are looking for a digital alternative to a disposable underwater camera.  If you are a serious photographer or a scuba diver, you might be better suited to buying an underwater housing for a higher quality camera.", "Date": "November 9, 2011"}, {"Title": "A very good value...", "Author": "M.

We bought it for a cruise we were going on wherein we knew there would be lots of fun in the water.  It performed better than expected.  We almost lost about three times; once at the bottom of the Meso-american reef in Costa Maya, MX (salt water).  Although I had attached a float to it, it proved to be a little heavier than the float when we dropped it while snorkeling in about 15-20 feet of water.  Our guide went back and found it... everything still worked!  We also dropped it while cave-tubing in Belize (very cold fresh water)... finally found it again.  Everything was fine.I had read of some who had purchased this camera saying it didn't pass the water-proof test.. and all I can figure is they must have done something wrong.  With all it went through on our trip, flying colors.  I've attached a clip showing some of its work in Costa Maya. Although the video looks a little \"green-heavy\" we all remember that part of the water had a bit of a greenish cast to it.  Later in Cozumel the water was a bit clearer and it reproduced better.  I would recommend this camera as an economical alternative to the higher end water cameras.", "Date": "October 3, 2011"}, {"Title": "Kodak C123 Sport 12 MP Digital Camera", "Author": "Rizor", "ReviewID": "R1G5GOK25361ZG", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "When looking for an underwater camera to take with me to Cancun I had done a lot of pricing.

I don't particularly like to use the flash when it's underwater because there are a bunch of white circles in the photo. The quality of the photos exceeded my expectations. Even though it says 12 megapixels, I still expected it to be crappy because it was so cheap. I was wrong! If you're in shallow pool water (3-4 feet) than there will be a slight blue tint. If you're in deeper water, the tint will be a light green. Again, it definitely wasn't a problem for me. If it is, you can easily change it on Photoshop within 2 minutes. In ocean water, if it isn't crystal clear, it might be a slight green color, but it's still clear. The images aren't blurry unless your drastically moving while taking the photo.The video camera also works great. It includes sound as well, which I wasn't expecting.TIP: Other reviews mention that it was hard to see the display. I had this problem too, but I finally figured it out. Under the settings menu, you can change its brightness. Just put it on automatic (or the highest level, but it wastes batteries) and you're good to go! I haven't had a problem with the display since I've changed the settings.I had so much fun with this camera and when my cousins and other family members asked how much I got it for, they were really surprised. It does its job and I guess the only negative thing I have to say about it is that it takes about half a second to take the picture for some reason. Maybe it's just my camera.If you're looking for an underwater camera, I'd definitely recommend this one! It's cheap and it's a lot safer than buying that plastic bag to stick your camera that's worth a couple hundred dollars (I'm assuming) in. I bought that bag too, and after testing it, I was way too skeptical of using it. Anyways, other cameras are priced so much higher. I don't know why this is so cheap, but definitely take advantage of it! It's perfect for vacations or use in your pool or whatever else. I'd recommend also bringing another camera for out of water use, though.", "Date": "August 6, 2011"}, {"Title": "Kid proof and great value for the money", "Author": "J.

I never used it underwater or intended to take pictures underwater. I've used it for taking pictures while kayaking and on a vacation to the Bahamas. It was never submerged under water but did float along beside me while I was snorkeling. The first few times I used it I had trouble knowing if it was on in the bright sunlight. After a few uses it would often not turn on the first time I pushed the button but a few tries and it would turn on. Just last weekend my husband and I took a trip to Miami. I took well over two hundred pictures with this camera. Everything seemed normal and it worked fine, allowing me to snap the photos. It wasn't used in the water during this trip. When I got home I went to upload them to find that there were no pictures on the memory card. My husband took a look and he sees some rust in the memory card slot. We think that water must have seeped in at some point and shorted out the memory card reader. Whatever happened it gave no indication that it wasn't recording the photos to the memory card and I lost all of my pictures from Miami, which makes me sad and angry. This camera is a complete waste of money. I wish I could return it but too much time has passed. I've only had it for a about four months. This camera was never fully submerged, so I highly doubt that it's waterproof at all, it doesn't even seem to be very water resistant.

I took it everywhere for 10 nights. I took it snorkeling, I took it to the beach, I took it to the Grand cenote, I even took it zip lining into the water at XPLOR. Pictures are not amazing quality but they are more than enough for memories and it was great knowing I didn't have to worry about it getting wet and being underwater.Even though the processor is slow and it take a couple of seconds to start the camera, load pictures, etc. I would have given it 5 stars because it's such a great value for the price. However, we're sitting at the swim up bar on the last day of our honeymoon looking at the pictures and my wife asks me to delete one of them. So I press delete, it asks me if I want to delete just this picture or all of them. Obviously, I select the option that deletes this picture only and press enter. Then it says, are you sure you want to delete all your pictures? Now at this point I'm having a mild heart attack and I make sure to select NO and I hit enter. AND IT STARTS DELETING ALL THE PICTURES. I felt incredibly bad for about 2 hours because I thought I had lost over 300 pictures of my honeymoon. Now I'm tech savvy enough to know not to take any more pictures or all hope will be lost. I cross the street to radio shack and buy a card reader and download file recovery software and I was able to get 99% of my pictures back.

This camera received mixed reviews but we took a chance. We have to say this camera worked really well. It produced excellent still 'dry' shots and videos. Tor underwater shots it didcreally well also. The one trick learnedcwas that the default setting is for 'out of the water' photos, so our first 'beneath the waves' shots were a little grainy. After figuring this out we were off and diving, admittedly no greater depths than 3 - 5 metres. One other pointer (not White !!) is to watch the backlight, especially just below the surface. Only other slight annoyance was the sound of the zoom being quite pronounced on the underwater videos. Wished it was a little quieter but the video quality was excellent andcwe took more than 10 mins at a time. Battery life is reasonable.

So my review isn't a \"first time user\" review with first impressions. I have been using this camera solidly for a year. I have seen it in a variety of conditions. Here is my review of it.First, the basics. The camera is about the size of an average digital camera / smart phone, about the size of a pack of cigarettes. It is reasonably light, and has a rubber bumper on its front to keep the lens from getting too damaged by putting it down face-down accidentally. It is a 12mp camera and takes a standard SD memory card. It has a video mode and zoom.I love to kayak, so I am constantly taking this camera out with me in the water. I actively take photos underwater, to get shots of interesting seaweed and fish. It has NEVER had any problem, in all these months, with being underwater. There is a two-layer system of protection for the two AA batteries and memory card. So you close up one plastic flap, and once that is closed you seal the outer plastic flap. Once both are sealed, you're set. Yes, it can be a bit tricky to get the inner orange flap to seal, but of course it's worth it to pay attention to doing that properly. If you let water into the insides of the camera, it undoubtedly stops working.The camera does NOT FLOAT. I purchased a third party float for the camera since, being in a kayak, it's a reasonable assumption that things in the kayak might end up in the water. So if you're looking to use this camera in active water situations, I highly recommend getting a float for it.The camera is a bit slow in taking photos. I get spoiled with my many other digital cameras, that I can point, shoot, and go right on to the next picture. Here there's a good 2 second delay before it gets the picture into memory. I don't mind, the camera is fairly inexpensive for being an underwater camera. If I have to be patient, that is fine.Sometimes in a bright sun-on-lake situation, or in a dark underwater situation, the screen display doesn't give you a clear view of what you're trying to take a photo of. I guess the display isn't bright enough, or not anti-glare enough, or something. So in certain circumstances I have to point and guess.There is screwhole at the base for mounting this onto a tripod. I suppose you might need one if you were shooting Niagara Falls photos and didn't want to worry about the camera being destroyed by the spray.The camera comes with software, but while I tried it out a few times, I find it much easier just to dump the memory card contents onto my hard drive and work with them in PhotoShop.I have taken this camera all over the place and it's been a trooper. I don't tend to handle my equipment gently. The camera has held up to the abuse.Highly recommended.", "Date": "July 25, 2012"}, {"Title": "Love this camera!", "Author": "Janice P.

I opted to use lithium batteries so that I would not have to open the camera up in case I was near water at the time and I never had to change the batteries and I took over 271 pics, many with flash.

I bought it about 3 months before. Reading the other reviews I wanted to test if it was truly waterproof so I left it in a bucket of water for about 5 hours and everything was fine.  Picture quality is what I expected and I was pleased with the test pictures I had taken.  Go on the trip and first time we used it was snorkeling, so it was in maybe 12 inches of water.  We get back on the boat and the camera is as dead as can be, it had leaked.  All the pictures we had taken thus far on our trip were gone, the memory card got salt water on it and is useless.  I don't know if maybe it is not supposed to be used in salt water or what happened since it seemed to be waterproof when I tested it.  Wouldn't trust it again, if I had to do it over I would have bought an expensive waterproof case for my regular camera or gone with the old school waterproof disposables.  Of course this all happens more than 30 days after I purchased it and dont know if its worth it to try to deal with Kodak directly, since I don't even want the same camera.

I bought the disposable cameras for the rest of the family. I purchased this camera for a super low price, expecting a low quality camera...boy was I in for a shock!  I have used this camera now for about 5 months and still love it!  I was really put off by the fact that it takes batteries, but it really is not too bad when it comes to the batteries.I have 3 children and I love taking pics of them.  I have the soccer mom Cannon special that I use to take most of my pics.  I wanted a decent pocket camera to take to places like the amusement park and the pool with the family.  This camera takes great pics for the price.  The biggest seller to me was that it has a flash (which the disposable water cameras do not).  There were maybe 2 pics per disposable water camera that were developed...all of my pics were awesome.The video feature is great.

The picture quality is great and the video is awesome, both above and below the water.  Now bear in mind it will not replace my regular camera for special photos or special occasions, but we have already had a lot of laughs with this camera and the fun things the kids do underwater.  I don't even use the underwater setting (I tried it, and it gave the pictures a yellow-green tint).  The regular setting works fine underwater, and allows you to transition from the surface to underwater with no change.

I added a large capacity SD card and had to download pictures on our last full day (400 pictures and about 20 minutes of video).I had one problem that was operator error. I failed to ensure the battery door was fully closed after downloading pictures. The camera failed during a morning snorkel. I simply dried it out in the room over breakfast and restarted it.

The camera is great for outdoor activity.  It operated well in and out of the water and the in-water pictures were much better than I expected them to be.  The pictures taken out of the water were as good a quality as my regular super shot camera.  No problem with the camera being water tight.  It can be difficult to see the viewer underwater.  I never figured out if it was lack of lighting or what, but like most camera viewers when outside, you just can't see the view.  The camera did pick up the color of the beautiful Bahama water.....the color quality of the pictures is great.  The lens fogged up one day.....never could figure out why or what the problem was.  I did have trouble converting the video extension to a readable format and had to search google to find the right extension conversion.

I didn't use the \"share\" function (I don't really see the necessity) but here's my impression of what I did use:Pros:The picture quality is fairly good, unzoomed video quality is good, and it does take pictures underwater without self-destructing. The scene lighting options are versatile and effective, and it is easy to figure out how to use.Cons:The camera is only waterproof up to about 10 feet, so it is best used as more of a water-resistant camera than a full on ocean recording device. It also sinks, so make sure you don't drop it in too deep of water. Battery life is fairly short, make sure you have backup batteries with you. Video sound quality is terrible, and you can hear the buttons on the camera click if you use the zoom in a video. Zoom greatly reduces the video quality as well. The auto picture mode, the default settings as the camera is turned on, make the image much too bright, so you have to adjust it every time the camera is turned on. Also, the lens fogged as I was using it kayaking, and I wasn't able to clean it in time to get good pictures. It cleared up eventually, but I would recommend keeping a cloth or something on hand in case this happens.Conclusion:I felt confident enough to take this camera boating, snorkeling, kayaking and a host of other places I wouldn't dare take a normal digital camera. As a result, I got pretty good pictures just by circumstance, and the quality is really not bad. It's a durable camera that does the job for not a lot of money, so all in all I would recommend it to a person using it for camping or other outdoor activities, snorkeling (but not diving), boating (canoeing, kayaking, etc). As far as surfing or similar activities go, it would probably get good pictures and good soundless video, just make sure you have a secure strap and some extra batteries.", "Date": "June 13, 2011"}, {"Title": "Cheaply built, mediocre photos", "Author": "Shawn", "ReviewID": "RNMBN6ERILUDC", "Overall": "1.0", "Content": "I bought this camera for a rafting trip down the Grand Canyon.

All the zoom is done digitally. Great for making the camera more durable with what kids tend to do to electronics. Also, if they leave it out in the rain I don't have to go buy a new camera!

I wanted something that would take video, be light enough to carry easily, and not cost too much.  After a lot of deliberation, I decided on this little camera.  I tested it out in a lake before taking it on the cruise.  I did have some trouble seeing the screen underwater, but that could also be related to not wearing my glasses in the water.  However, since I'm so used to using a viewfinder anyway, I didn't have much trouble taking pictures of what I wanted.  It worked great shooting in the lake (though there wasn't much to see there), and it worked just as well in the ocean and climbing a waterfall.  There was no leakage (thanks to the double door for the battery), and I didn't have any problems with the lens fogging up despite the humidity.  I made sure to rinse my camera in the sink when I got back to the cruise ship-just to be safe.I've had no problems with the camera, and the images are good quality.  The images aren't as high quality as my Canon Rebel XTi, but I was able to use it in place of my Canon while on excursions off the cruise ship and still obtain good pictures.

I was not expecting too much from a $60 camera, but this little camera WAY exceeded my expectations! Over the course of a week, I took almost 600 pictures and a dozen or so short video clips of fish and scenery. During that time, I only changed the batteries once (I was using non-rechargeable alkaline AAs).To conserve battery power, I did turn the camera off in the water when I wasn't using it. The underwater pictures were best in very clear water when the sun was out, but that is probably the case no matter what kind of camera you have, and the videos were surprisingly good too. I took a few pictures above and out of the water, and they were also nice and clear with great color and exposure. Overall, I really am happy with this little guy, and will enjoy taking it on future trips or hiking or boating when we are likely to get wet. I bought a floating wrist strap that was really helpful in keeping it attached to me, so I didn't have to worry about dropping it to the bottom.My one and only problem with it is that after a week in salt water (I did wash it off at the end of each day), some of the anti-glare coating on the screen has worn off, but that doesn't affect the camera's performance, so I can live with that. I also think it is important to make sure the camera is dry and be gentle when opening the battery compartment when changing the batteries or memory card.

For this price did not expect professional quality photos, just good quality amateur photos, and our expectations were exceeded.  Did everything really well -- amazing underwater video (and you can zoom in and out 'live' during a video) even in low-ish light, very good transition between above water and below water in the same clip of video, really great still photos, turns itself to 'sleep' when you don't use it for a bit, then turns back on as soon as you hit the button, worked great diving to 6-10 feet below (we were snorkeling, not scuba-ing) and also took great pictures in 2 different pools.  When you turn it off it reverts to 'auto' so make sure you set it back to \"H20\" before using it underwater again.  We haven't yet explored all of the features but the basics work very well indeed.  No leakage problems whatsoever in 2 weeks of hard use, no fog problems either.  Uploaded photos and videos in to iPhoto automatically, very easily done with the connecting cord which is included for USB slot.  2 Kodak batteries which came with the camera lasted a reasonably long time, but we bought the long life lithium batteries once we wore those original ones out and the battery life seemed to be quite good, even when taking a number of 5 minute videos in a row.  Make sure you buy an SD card as the camera does not come with.  We mostly used it for outdoor photos although son took a number of indoor videos in low light which turned out quite well.  Only quibble would be that the slot to put the connecting cord in is very close to the piece of the camera which flips up to open the output/battery compartment, and it seems that that piece of the camera could break off easily.  We were very careful in connecting and disconnecting the cord and thus didn't have any issues.  We also made sure to wipe the camera off with a damp cloth after using it in the sea, and didn't open it until we'd been out of the water for a few hours.  Orange colour made it very visible when digging for it in the dive bag.  Make sure you buy a floating wrist strap because while this camera does everything ... it doesn't float !

The XP60 was a little over $200 dollars and I just really didn't want to spend that much - especially since I'm buying this specifically for my trip, so I then keep going back to the XP50. After more searching I then came across the Nikon Coolpix AW100, it hands down was the BEST choice for the money, comes with GPS, 16MP CMOS Sensor, 33ft depth for underwater and 5X optical zoom. The pictures I came across online look great underwater and out of the water and it can do 60FPS HD 1080 video!

Very good price, good quality picture, and it looked as a reliable product. I have some concerns about some of the negative reviews, saying that there were leakings and odd behaviour after using it underwater. I decided, though, to give it a try, risking that if the camera failed I wouldn't be able to get a refund, because sending the camera over would be a pain in the ass and it could take forever. Plus, I really wanted this to be the present.  So, this was the scenaro in which the camera was bought, to give you an idea of why the rating. Here's what happened. We used the camera for regular shooting, outside, inside. I'm a photographer so I tried pretty much everything. We used it out of the water like a week or so, because the weather was bad and we couldn't get to go to the beach or to a swimming pool. Yesterday the weather was pretty much ok and we went to a water park. As soon as we got there, we got into the pool and started taking underwater photos and shooting videos. It was ok, the lcd wasn't very visible 'cause of the sun, and the audio of the video wouldn't play (though I knew that it was made that way). So, after a couple of hours of using it and pluning into water and sliding down some rides, we turned of the camera and the screen begin to flicker. Then it went blank. Then it flickered again. We didn't know what to do or what happened. We looked every compartment to see if water had leaked or wtf could be causing that. We got into the internet and searched for the problem. It said that the camera should be left off for drying, so we remove the sd memory and the batteries, quit using it for 24 hours and waited. We just turned it on again, and it works perfectly! The screen doesn't flicker, nor goes blank. We downloaded the pictures and videos and it all looks pretty good (image and sound too!). It is a very good camera, nice, easy to carry in a swimsuit pocket and around your wrist. BUT that flickering thing freaked me out. I think it maybe had to do with some steam or sth. Like the camera got wet and because of the heat, there was steam inside it. IDK. The thing is, it is a very good product, but I'd be more comfortable with a product that doesn't behave that way.  But I think that that's one of the risks of getting things via amazon living on the other side of the globe. It IS a good deal. You just have to be careful.

They continued taking pictures after they recovered both the kayak and camera with zero problems.

On our first day there our 3 year old decided to start swimming underwater for the first time.  This camera was perfect for catching those moments.  I've since used it for every pool party, lake adventure, and just times at the local city pool.  It works great.  The only complaint I've had is trying to see the images on the screen has been hard at times in the bright sunlight, so I've had a lot of \"just shoot, shoot, shoot, and wait til I get home to see what I've got\" days.  Luckily it takes so many great shots I'm usually happy with what I wind up with.As far as video goes, I can't complain there either.  It's a small camera, so the video quality isn't that  of a larger HD video camera, but it's sufficient for catching those smalls moments in the pool.I bought rechargeable batteries immediately so I can't so what the normal battery life is like.  I know in the month and a half that I've had the camera I've had to recharge once so far.  That's with using it frequently.I really like this little camera and have received so many complements on the pictures I've taken with it.

I was a little hesitant on purchasing this after reading all of the negative reviews.  However, I am really glad I decided to buy the camera.  The quality of pictures and videos are pretty good and I was surprised to see how well they looked. Battery life is good.  I took about 300 pictures and a few minutes of video in 1.5 sets of batteries.

I did a Lot of homework, searching for just the right one. It had to be easy to use, with not too many buttons. It had to be durable enough that if he drops it, it won't shatter. And, I didn't want to deal with extra parts - camera lens covers, swiveling screens, etc that could break easily. This camera fits all of that and more.I spent maybe 10 minutes showing my son how to turn on the camera, switch from stills to video, and how to access the pictures in the camera's memory, scroll through and delete. That's it - then he was off taking a million pictures, videos, etc. We uploaded them to the computer at the end of the day, and he was thrilled to see a slide show of all his work.My son wasn't interested in any of the fancy camera modes like sunset, sports mode, etc but it's great that the camera has these. These are nice features he can grow into later. I love that the camera is waterproof, and we can't wait to take it to the pool and the beach.This camera was not designed for kids though so I will add that from an adult perspective, if I didn't already have a camera, I would be perfectly happy using this myself. At 12 MP, it takes great pictures. It is easy to use, has all the nice features I look for in a camera, stills and video, zoom works nicely, and even comes in fun colors (ours is blue). It is easy to download pictures, and has a great feature that allows you to take a picture for \"sharing\" - which means quick upload to facebook, twitter, email, or several other sources. You take the picture and then tag it with the click of a button; then later when you connect your camera to your computer, it autotmatically pushes the pictures to the sources you've tagged. This allows us to skip having to review all our pictures at the end of the day/party to find our favorites, and lets us quickly share the pictures we know came out great.I do wish that you could hear the audio when playing back a video. This threw us a bit when we first recorded a video and tried to play it back on the camera, it played with no sound. We thought we'd done something wrong, and couldn't find mention of it in the instructions. Later when we uploaded the video though, the sound came through loud and clear on the pc. Otherwise though, GREAT camera. I plan to borrow this camera from my son next summer when ever we go to the beach.

I had another camera along for the trip that I had been using for several years, but I used this one for everything.  There are several limitations to this camera that you need to be aware of, but once you understand them, this camera will work well for everyday and wet conditions.  The main limitation on this camera is the fixed focus.  This means you can't use an optical zoom or a macro setting.  This also means that underwater you have to get fairly close to your subject matter, 5-10 ft.  Also for underwater photography the brighter the day, the clearer the water, the better the photos.  I was able to take photos of fish, coral, turtles, and even an Eagle Ray while snorkeling.  I was happy with all the photos I took and some of my friends who were with me and saw the photos were equally impressed for the quality compared to the price of this camera.

Purchased this camera because my more expensive cameras kept getting ruined and was sick of spending the money.  This camera so far is working great.  As soon as I purchased this camera I took it out to the pool.  We filmed video and and took pictures both above and below the water.  It worked out great.  You cannot hear the sound on the camera.  You will need to put the video on the computer to hear the sound which is fine because technically I didn't buy a video camera.  Took this on a trip to Disney World and turned out having great pictures and wasn't afraid to take it out and on all rides including water rides.  No worries of it getting wet or broken.  The reason I didn't give 5 stars was because of two things.  The first was a lot (not all) of my night pictures we not very clear.  They looked a little grainy.  Some were taken by a campfire so perhaps the heat/flame did something to the way they were taken (the pics were taken across the fire).  The others were taken in low light (although I had on flash) so I'm not sure why they were grainy.  The other reason was because it takes about 5 seconds to be able to take another picture.  Didn't think that would be a problem (as I had read that it took awhile) but when in actual use with kids 5 seconds is a pretty long time LOL!  Still I would buy this camera again and have recommended it to friends.  For the price it is definitely right for an active family who love the sun and fun and water.

I wanted something waterproof, because I know the location is famous for constant rain.  I wasn't too concerned with the camera's underwater shooting capabilities, so I haven't tried to submerge it.  I just want something that can be used outside in wet weather without worries.After reading some others' reviews, I was a bit concerned with how the picture quality would be.  I tested the camera out here at home and took a few pictures around the neighborhood.  I found the pictures to come out quite clear for the most part.  I did notice though that it is difficult to get a good shot in low light.  I didn't expected much though for the price.  I only paid $65 for the camera, and I feel that is a fair amount for what it offers.Aside from the minor issue of the difficulty of taking evening photos, the only real complaint I've had is that the camera did not come with instructions.  Normally this wouldn't be much of an issue, because operation is pretty straight forward (point and shoot).  The confusion I had though was in how to load the batteries.  It took me nearly a half hour to figure out how to unlatch the battery casing, only to find a second locked area inside that also had to be opened.  Thankfully I figured out the secret.  On the outside latch, there is a tiny black button that must be slid.  This unlocks the latch so that it may be slid in the direction of the printed arrow on the casing.  Inside there is a second orange casing.  It must be moved backward slightly to unlock.  It would have been nice to know this from the start, because not only do the batteries go inside this area, but that's also where the USB chord plugs in to upload photos. I thought this was odd.  On every other camera I've used, the connector is on the side or bottom of the camera.A few other people noted that the paint/coloring of the camera began to chip off immediately after use.  Thankfully I have not experience that, and I am certainly not a delicate user.  I have the blue camera.  I'm not sure if other colors are more prone to this issue.Another concern some people mentioned is the lag time between shooting one picture and the next. I have noticed a slight wait.  I think this would only be an issue if one was taking action shots.

I figure it's better to put this camera in compromising situations and risk it getting broken then to not take pictures at all.Uses two AA batteries. A big plus when you're off the grid.Very Easy to use.Waterproof. I haven't tested this and don't intend to take underwater pictures. I just want a camera I can canoe/kayak with and not have to store away while paddling.CONS:This camera is not for photographers, it's for picture takers. Forget closeups. Minimum focus distance is not spec'd and the best I can tell it's around 6 feet.Ran some tests on the image quality. I compared 12 megapixel shots with 6 megapixel shots and can see no difference on a high resolution laptop screen.Zooming is all digital so unless it's difficult to crop later, don't bother zooming. Not zooming in the camera will give you complete freedom to crop and zoom later.UPDATE 7/3/2013: This camera took videos and photos underwater very well.

I did a LOT of research on this camera- and couldn't be more pleased with it. The color in the stock photo does not do the actual color justice- its a vibrant, beautiful color blue, and I was glad I bought this option. I also got the floating wrist strap bundle; I saw the exact Kodak wrist strap at Walmart for $13, so needless to say the bundle is a money saver!!I tested the camera in the pool yesterday, and I was very apprehensive at first. Putting a camera underwater goes against everything I know about them! But I was pleasantly surprised in the quality of the pictures, as well as the video.I found that in the pool, the general mode does not autocorrect the blue color in the photos like the underwater feature does. It seemed to make the pictures more clear, but that's just my opinion. All in all, for the money this is a GREAT BUY, and I can't wait to have it in the water with me in Maui next week!!!!On a side note for accessories: this camera's internal memory can only hold 7 PICTURES- so be warned, you will definitely need a memory card of some kind!!!", "Date": "September 1, 2011"}, {"Title": "Great camera but follow the directions", "Author": "wham", "ReviewID": "R2ETAHLP3KZJ8C", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "I got this camera for my 8 yo.

The flash was bright enough in the absolute darkness of the cave that I was able to capture several photos of the amazing cave wall formations.  When it was time for snorkeling I set the camera to its H2O setting (which you must do each time you turn it on as it reverts to auto each time) and snapped away capturing pictures of the sea life and my family.  My favorite part of this little gem is the H2O video setting.  I was able to video my oldest child while he snorkeled, scan the reef and return to video the fish swimming around him.  I didn't have high expectations for the picture and video quality, but when I got home and uploaded it all I was amazed to discover that many of the picture competed with the quality of some of our more expensive cameras and the audio quality was good too.

The underwater features work great as well, and we got some very nice underwater video of the fish and coral, etc... Having said all that, however, the camera has some serious flaws. First, it apparently has no optical zoom whatsoever, it's all digital, which means it has no zoom at all, because the digital zoom is horrible. I would recommend not using it at all. Second, when shooting underwater, if you do use the zoom while you're recording video, the zooming mechanism is very loud and very noticeable when you play back the video on your computer. Sounds like something is hitting the camera twice every time you zoom in or out. Very very annoying... Not even sure why it happens since there is no optical zoom, but trust me it's there. The position of the mic is also poorly designed, as it's near the bottom corner and more than once I've found my finger covering it up while holding the camera underwater, and so when you play back the footage, it's like there's no sound. The built-in speaker is also very weak for video playback, if you're outside, good luck hearing it.So basically, it's good for the price point, especially since it's 12MP and it shoots underwater, but the lack of any zoom and the poor design of other components only merits 3 stars from me.", "Date": "August 15, 2011"}, {"Title": "Disappointing", "Author": "Stuart Case", "ReviewID": "R3A0MQYZ24RJZ3", "Overall": "2.0", "Content": "First, the zoom on this camera is entirely digital, not optical as described by Amazon. The lens does not telescope, but is fixed, probably for waterproofing purposes.

Also, the picture quality is mediocre for a 12 Megapixel camera.  My old Sony 6 Megapixel camera takes clearer pictures, has an optical zoom, and a viewfinder (which unfortunately has disappeared from point and shoot cameras).

The problem in my mind is not a possible faulty on-off switch, but the way in which Kodak has set up the limited warrant and return policy.  First I had to call their repair company - they said they didn't repair this model.  Then I contacting kodak who have a $15 fee for any support (I imagine this will lead to major loss of market share).  Then I got online to their (free)site to get a repair number that again lead to my getting the \"this model does not get repaired\" message.  Then I tried on-line chat and after 45 minutes of telling this guy that the problem was initially not turning on but had led to (over time) intermittent problems with turning on, he finally gave me a reference number for repairing this.  He said if they can't find a problem they will send it back but I have to say, missing out on a week of underwater pictures is a big bummer.  This is more of a complaint about Kodak then about the camera itself (which seems to have glowing reviews here).I understand that occasionally one gets a faulty product but it appears as though the system they have in place to resolve problems discourages people from doing so.

I broke multiple nails over the 2 years we had it and there were times it took two people to get it open to change the batteries or get out the memory card.Ultimately this caused our camera to fail on the first snorkeling trip of our 9 day vacation.  The door appeared closed, the little black slider was in it's home position. However there must have been a small opening that wasn't closed all the way because water got in and after one photo it shut off and then later we noticed water in the lens and in the screen.

You cannot even close the outside compartment unless the inside one is fully snapped closed first. Both compartments were fully snapped closed when the camera was used.After laying the camera out to dry, it still will not work.

I have kept it in the water for up to 30 minutes with no problems. I never submerged it more than about 6 feet, but it claims to endure up to 3m or ~9ft. I have no problems leaving it strapped to my wrist while I swim around in lakes and beaches. The body is fairly rugged and survives bumps and other inevitable events that occur when swimming.The quality of pictures is pretty darn good, especially when compared to having no photo at all! If you're snorkeling, tubing, or swimming in a lake and want to snap a few photos, this camera is great. The underwater video comes out very good, even in slightly murky water. If you can see it with your goggles, the camera will be able to capture it.As other have mentioned, the lack of optical zoom means that photos are taken almost the instant you press the button with very little delay. I find this convenient since things can swim away at any moment. The photos do seem to take a little longer than usual to save to the card, but it has a burst mode so you can take three pictures in a row by holding down the shutter button. I find this to be quite useful.I like how it takes AA batteries, so if you're using it multiple days in a row in a remote location (camping, travelling) you can keep using it without needing to find an outlet. Also it takes a standard SD card so the photo capacity is up to you. There is a setting to adjust LCD screen brightness if you need to squeeze more out of the batteries.For the price this thing is awesome.

The Kodak C123 outperformed the Vivitar VF526 in almost every way and was easily worth the additional ~$20.Disclaimer: We are not photography experts and may have achieved better results if we knew how to properly adjust settings on either camera.  These results are based on factory settings for each camera  after confirming that picture quality was increased to the maximum setting (14MP for Vivitar VF526, 12MP for Kodak C123).*Vivitar VF526*Purchased: 04/2013Settings: 14MP (4320x3240), dynamic exposure (ISO 50 to ISO 400), focal 8.5 mm, O EV, f/2.8, dynamic exposure (1/4 to 1/500 seconds)Picture Count: 146Batteries Used: 2 AAA (Alkaline)Batteries Consumed: 4 AAA (replaced batteries once)Waterproof Performance: No problem at 1 meter, Salt Water and Chlorinated WaterUnderwater Photo Quality: 4/5 (very clear)Time: The date/time is LOST (reset to 01/01/2012 12:00 AM) each time the cover is opened to access batteries or memory card.Default Image Quality: 2MP (defaults to lowest image quality, be sure to change to 14MP)*Kodak Sport C123*Purchased: 08/2011Settings: 12MP (4000x3000), fixed exposure (ISO 80), focal 6.3 mm, 0 EV, f/4.5, dynamic exposure (1/8 to 1/1250 seconds)Picture Count: 628Batteries Used: 2 AA (Rechargeable Sanyo Eneloop)Batteries Consumed: 2 AA (did not have to replace or charge batteries during entire trip)Waterproof Performance: No problem at 1 meter, Salt Water and Chlorinated WaterUnderwater Photo Quality: 3/5 (slightly cloudy)Time: The date/time is MAINTAINED each time the cover is opened to access batteries or memory card.Default Image Quality: 12MP (defaults to maximum image quality)Comparison in various lighting conditions:Pictures taken in direct sunlight at noon: the Kodak C123 captures faces with light shadows while the Vivitar VF526 captures faces with VERY DARK shadows.  The Kodak C123 pictures are very good compared to the Vivitar VF526 pictures.Pictures taken 30 minutes prior to sunset: the Kodak C123 sunset pictures looked good while the Vivitar VF526 sunset pictures were fairly dark.  The sun appeared yellow or orange in the Kodak C123 pictures and green in the Vivitar VF526 pictures.Pictures taken less than 5 minutes prior to sunset: the pictures from both cameras looked good.  The sun appeared red in pictures from both cameras.Pictures taken 20 minutes after sunset: the pictures from the Kodak C123 were brighter and contained more detail than the pictures from the Vivitar VF526.Pictures taken in dark at night: neither camera was able to capture pictures in dark settings at night.  Pictures from both cameras were very dark with almost no detail.Overall, the picture quality from the Kodak C123 were much better than similar pictures from the Vivitar VF526 except for those taken underwater.  The Vivitar VF526 seemed to take slightly better/clearer underwater pictures.  Of the two cameras, I would recommend the Kodak C123 (or possibly the newer C135).

We have used the little disposable underwater cameras before without much luck, so I thought I would try my luck with an inexpensive waterproof digital camera.  Most of my pictures are taken with a $500 DSLR, so I didnt' expect much out of a little $60 camera.  Boy was I in for a surprise.  I tried not to fully immerse it in water and it was taking great shots with just getting a bit of water splashed on it here and there.  But then my son decided to go down a water slide and at the bottom I had to catch him quickly and forgot about the camera, so it was totally immersed.  It still took great pictures.  I did not try to take any pictures under water, but the camera survived immersion very well.Pros:  takes great pictures, lots of settings for your environment, easy to use (note: I did not use the kodak software, I took the SD card out of camera and put it directly into my laptop to view and save the pictures.), can but fully immersed in water, pictures that are only slightly zoomed in still look terrific, removable memory.Cons:  It's not really red, it's orangish red.  1 set of batteries will last about 3/4 of a day depending on how much you are using the camera.

If you do not close that inner door securely, it WILL leak, and you will have to dry it out for 24 hours.  After 9 hours of use, the outer lens fogged only once, and otherwise it worked wonderfully for a sometimes-photographer.I would recommend that you purchase a floating camera strap.

It took almost everything I could throw at it and more, as we went in and out of coral reefs, with me accidentally running into rocks with it, and a cave that had natural sulfur in it.The only problem I did have was in the cave, when the camera froze twice for about two minutes apiece. The first time, I did not take any pictures, the second time, someone else had my camera and took some without realizing it was frozen. It took the pictures, but they were black with dots on it-what the camera screen had frozen at.I was not overly careful with the camera, feeling that if the camera died the last day of the trip, it was $100 well spent. I got over 600 pictures, and backed them up each night as a precaution.The battery compartment never leaked, not even a drop, and I was thrilled with the quality of the camera for the price.

I rinsed the cameras off at the end of the day and dried them overnight, but other than that, nothing else special.  You do need to wipe off the lense after using underwater before you use out of the water.  Can't beat the price either!  The only downside is that every time it powers off it reverts to Auto mode and was a little difficult to switch to H2O still mode while looking through a mask underwater, but I got used to it.

Bauman \"bauman171\"", "ReviewID": "RQTBAZ6UYJOA8", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "I purchased this camera primarily to use on a family vacation to the Caribbean.  Mostly, I was looking for an relatively inexpensive camera with underwater picture capability that was also compact, for use when I didn't want to carry around my DSLR.  The Kodak C123 Sport seemed to fit the bill.The camera uses an SD memory card (1 1/4\" X 7/8\" with a corner that appears dog-eared), and I would recommend at least a couple gigs because of the camera's 12 megapix.**This camera doesn't have a rechargable battery; 2 AA batteries are needed and if you intend to keep the camera ready for spontaneous pictures, make sure you have backups because standard batteries (as opposed to rechargable AA batteries) don't last terribly long. I was disappointed to have to swim back to shore for fresh batteries on two different occasions.  I would guesstimate that a set of batteries lasts maybe 2 or 3 hours.Another consideration for underwater photography- when you turn the camera off and then turn it back on, the camera automatically defaults back to factory settings.  This means that if you have the camera set for underwater photographs and then turn the camera off, when you turn it back on you will have to go to the menu and select underwater photography and then choose either picture or video before taking pictures.  I haven't been able to figure out a way to change the default, but the quality of the photograph(s) improves when the underwater setting is used underwater (I suppose it compensates for the way water refracts light).  On a similar note, pictures that are taken within 30 to 45 minutes of getting out of the water may turn out a bit fuzzy.**On the other hand, this camera is compact, fairly easy to use and takes very clear photographs and videos both in and out of the water.  Occasionally my snorkel mask would fog up, making it difficult to see the camera display.  But in clear water on a sunny day, the pictures came out beautifully.  I (accidentally) took a couple of very short underwater videos when I couldn't clearly see the camera display to see that I selected video over picture, but those videos came out beautifully as well.The floaty armband is also handy, adjustable and serves its purpose well.I cannot comment on the Kodak Share program that comes with the camera, as I haven't had any interest in using it thus far.Anyone considering this camera that would like to see a few examples of underwater pictures can contact me at CBauman@hotmail.com.

It goes underwater, and I'm not afraid to take it on any of my outdoor adventures.  But if you decide you'd like to zoom in on anything, you'd better find a different camera.  The images are immediately pixelated when zoomed in at any magnification.  The different settings make a little bit of a difference, but nothing profound.

We were going to be going on a cruise in the bahamas and wanted to get a camera we could lug around in our pocket, bring to the beach, snorkel and take some \"decent\" pictures with. This baby did everything I expected and a bit more.This is no DSLR camera by any stretch of the imagination, but for the purpose of a quick point and shoot, water proof, rugged type camera - this fits the bill nicely.My first pictures were taken outdoors on top of our ship in NY in Feb. So it was pretty gray with very little light.  It seemed to take \"ok\" pictures. It was pretty hard to tell on the display. So I was basically rolling the dice that they were good. Since I used an 8GB SD card, I made sure to take an ample amount of pictures, so I had plenty to choose from at the end of the trip.Those pictures turned out pretty decent. But the pictures that really turned out good were ones in bright sunlight and the ones I took under water. That was the purpose of us buying the camera. The underwater pictures turned out as good as I could have expected for a camera that cost me 80 bucks. If the water is clear - you will get some good footage.  In our case, there was some cloudiness to the water, so you don't have quite the range of visibility. But that was expected. It was easy to use under water for the most part.  It was kind of hard to see the display under water, but I didn't really use it anyhow. I just held it towards what I wanted to capture and that worked fine for me.After a day at the beach, I just rinsed it off with fresh water, and let it dry. No problems with leaking or such. Everything is sealed nicely. My only complaint would be that it is pretty easy to accidentally open the battery/SD card compartment. So I could see possibly doing it while snorkeling if you aren't careful.Indoor pictures turned out ok. With the flash, it took good pictures in darker settings. With out the flash, you will get alot of noise. It has a few different settings (or Scenes) you can use, but I usually just kept it on Auto, and used the flash when needed. (which you can turn on / off, pre-flash/redeye, or auto)For closeups indoor with the flash, it works good. I think you should take some practice shots before your trip to see what works best in what situations.  I just took a ton of pictures and deleted the ones that didn't look good.To sum it up, I would highly recommend this camera for the purpose of an extra vacation / beach / under water camera. It will not compete on photo quality with some of the other point and shoots out there, and it does have a decent lag after each shot,  but for a waterproof - sub 100$ camera - 12.1 MP, you just can't beat it.And if you can do some minor editing (using Iphoto or similar) you can really make the pictures look fantastic.

There were a number of things I liked about the camera and a few things I did not like.  I'll start with the things I like:  It takes quality pictures for a point and shoot, the majority of pictures are not grainy, the pictures came out in true colors for the most part, and it worked well taking a variety of pictures in a variety of settings.  Now to the things that I did not like: After two days of using this camera in the ocean I noticed the paint started chipping.  That is not ideal, but it doesn't really affect the performance of the camera so I am not too worried about that.  I was not very impressed with was the LCD screen.  It was very fuzzy, so it was difficult to tell the quality of the picture until it was on the computer.  Also, just a side note, I personally liked the auto setting under the water better than the H20 setting.  The H20 setting took out the blue, and in the ocean that just made the water look green.  Nobody wants to look like they were in green water when they were in crystal clear blue water, so I would try both settings to see which works better for your situation.  You can look at my pictures I posted to see the difference between the auto setting underwater and the H20 setting, they were taken in the same location.  Overall, this is a very nice camera for the price.

Others have mentioned poor battery life, but I am closing in on 300 pictures and 60 minutes of video and I am only on my second set of batteries after more than 6 months of use.  You just need to turn it off when you are not shooting pics. (this isn't your I phone)  This is the 3rd waterproof camera I have used, and this is the first model that hasn't leaked.  Just be careful with sand.  The bad:  There is a long delay between depressing the button and the shutter, so not too hot for getting action shots.  There is an even longer delay between taking one pic and waiting for it to reset for the next pic, even with a fast memory chip.  You do need to hold it still while shooting pics, otherwise they will blur.  In low light conditions the pics become very grainy (the flash overcomes this issue for nearby objects)  The video is not stabilized so it can be very jumpy if you move the camera at all.  During video shooting it doesn't seem to readjust the exposure as the light changes.  Over all I am quite pleased with this camera.  The pictures can be quite stunningly beautiful.

The awsome thing is that I ended using this camera for every outing... wet or dry.Of course, I'm not a professional photographer. I'm more of the kind \"aim and shoot\", which is why I find this camera fits to my needs. It does pay to practice the settings and ISOs and whatnot, because you can have a sharper image from day to night, in the water and out, with glare and without.... Ahh to complicated for me to keep explaining, I'm doing it on instint by now.PROS:-Its small, fits every decent sized pocket, and comes with its cord.-Can stand salt water, river water, cold water, hot-springs water.... I have come everywhere with this cuttie.CONS:-The screen can be scratch easily, so be carefull and do not leave it near keys and pointy things.-The scene that you may want to capture can look a little more darker on the screen because of the plastic/glass that is made of. BUT the pictures look amazing, don't worry.-Would have love a pouch to store it. Came with none.True story, this is my second camera.

The AW100 arrived last week and it's really a fantastic camera, well worth the extra $200.  The image quality is as good as any Canon SD compact camera, 5x optical + 5x digital zoom, stereo 1080p video, slow-motion video, GPS, and much more control over image settings.

The white-balance is great on land and poor underwater.  All my underwater photos and videos have a greenish tint and no vivid colors - even those taken in shallow water under direct sunlight.  The camera fogs over with changes in temperature and it takes a few minutes and a few pictures for this to clear up.  It is not the lens, because I kept it clear and clean - it must be internal.

Zeck", "ReviewID": "R3E7LZEQN9ZLJI", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "I took this camera on a week-long snorkeling trip.  It was in the water for hours at a time once or twice a day for five days.  During that time, it never leaked or malfunctioned, and took good pictures in and out of the water.A sample image from the camera:[...]The camera performed way beyond my expectations.  It was exactly what I was looking for: a camera to take pictures while snorkeling or in a pool.  I was not looking to replace my regular digital camera or to take pictures in deeper water.There were some negatives about it though:- There is no viewfinder.  The LCD screen displays the picture it is about to take.  This is common with smaller digital cameras, but the LCD screen is hard to see in bright light.  Underwater, through a foggy facemask, it's almost impossible to see.  On overcast days or in the evening it's not so bad.  The screen also dims itself after 10 seconds of inactivity to save power, but you can push any button to restore it.  There seems no way to disable power-saving.  I took pictures by holding the camera close to the thing I wanted a picture of and hoping for the best.- It used up the two AA batteries it came with in 1 day of shots.  Replacement batteries lasted several days though.  An SD card I got for the camera also became unwritable after about 80 shots.  I don't know whether the camera or the card was to blame.  A replacement SD card worked fine for hundreds more pictures.- Movies are pretty low-res (640x480).- The camera does not notify you of low battery (it just shuts itself off; this may be hard to tell underwater since the screen looks dark anyway) or a bad memory card (it acts like it's taking a picture but they won't be there when you review pictures).- It's a little slow to take a picture and reset for the next one (about 4 seconds).Some other notes:- It has an \"h2o mode\" to take underwater stills or movies.  Push the mode button, then select h2o to activate it.  Underwater mode adjusts the color balance a bit, but uses more power.  If the battery is nearly dead, taking pics in h2o mode will just cause the camera to shut off.  It might still be able to take pictures in normal mode though.  It will automatically revert to normal mode when you turn it off.- It might try to use the flash underwater.  That can reflect off all the little particles in the ocean and make it look like you took a picture in a snowstorm.  You can push the flash button to disable it.- There is a microphone for recording sound in movies, but no speaker for playing back the movie on the camera.- If you put in an SD card that was used by another digital camera, the C123 will let you browse and delete the other camera's pictures (some cameras only show you their own).", "Date": "December 11, 2011"}, {"Title": "Camera leaked... lost my pics & SD Card", "Author": "Ken in CT", "ReviewID": "R3NHVSM6V2Z5DV", "Overall": "1.0", "Content": "I'm rather disappointed in the product which had many positive reviews and seemed promising for the price.

But, the pictures posted here on amazon.com are quite superior to what you will usually get. That is why I am posting my own test pics to give some comparisons.I purchased this for my outdoor activities, right before the first trip to Grand Canyon for my novice companion. from day 1, I knew the picture quality was below average, not good enough for my grand trip. I decided to stop using it. And, when I returned, I brought it out to the beach(October heat wave, yay~!)near where I live.You will see the result of it. I cropped one or two pics, but, I did not use photoshop  and you can see the candid images I took.____________1. Location - The beach scene is done around 12-3pm on Sunny October daytime.-Underwater pics are not impressive and most of the time, out of focus, and these pics are slightly better ones.-Whenever you switch 'on' the camera, the setting goes back to 'AUTO\" mode, and, the difference of the 'Auto' and 'Vivid' are shown(very yellow-tinted with Vivid, on the sandy hill background)____________Although I don't show it here, the 'self-portraight pics' with flash light(Strong sun-shadow contrast) tend to be the best feature of C123 as the pic results are almost as good as the other one with manual flashlight settings.And, the pics taken from the car, with 40+m/h speed, was decent.____________2. The Video mode,You can also see that the digital zoom is real joke and you will hear my unsuccessful zoom out click attempt, just like woodpeckers. And, the sun gets in the lens and the image is simply dull.3. location - Boat docking area, Butterfly, and plant closeup scenes are taken from my walk, around 4-5:30pm, on the following day in October, 2011.-Although the good composition and the nice objects, Sunset make the images look rich often, as you can see, it often darkens the image, and less saturated color, and, most of the time, it is not true to your eyes greatly.4. Close-ups and evening scenes are no,no.And, you should expect greatly compromised with the result if you use it to take picture for the ordinary day life. Exposure is inconsistent. And, I could not get the result that I could get from other higher-end cameras.I instantly noticed the cheap price means, their processor is probably from mid- to late- 1990s. My first digital camera of 1.2mega pixel has the similar quality then.5. The 'blue metalic paint' peels off from the first beach day and the body is white plastic underneath it.____________In conclusion,With its price under $70, I can't be complaining as I can explore more of the 'in the water,' situations- not under the water, really- i get the different angles of the distant landscape, walking into the Sea, or braving heavy rain storm seasons-For Now.This Kodak C123 will be a great toy for the young kids or a decent expansive option for unusual weather situation.", "Date": "October 11, 2011"}, {"Title": "great little camera", "Author": "sagebrushsue", "ReviewID": "R2S6YEIYIHW1PU", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "this is a great little camera.

After taking about 160 photos and one underwater water video, I downloaded the pix to iPhoto. Overall the pictures were of good quality (sharp, clean, and crisp). However, the quality was poor when using zoom (no better than using a cell phone zoom - the image became pixelated). The underwater photos were OK--just as good or better than a traditional underwater disposable camera. The video quality was also OK when recording underwater and it also captured the sound. The camera was dropped twice with no problems noted. For a fairly cheap camera that can handle the water, its worth having in your travel bag.

Somewhat shock resistant however i would not recommend testing this.  The videos look crisp and clear even when in dark areas, haven't tried in near pitch black yet.  There are the basic functions integrated into the firmware but nothing that truly impresses.Cons: No optical zoom although not many underwater cameras can have it. This would have been a nice feature which brings me to the second down side to not having optical zoom the focus is fixed so anything closer than 3ft looks blurry and \"unfocused.\"  I like lithium ion batteries however this uses AAs not really a con since they are so plentyful but they never seem to last as long even when using hi-cap rechargables.Other: Overall the price to performance ratio is great. You get a wonderfully funtional camera for a small price tag. One thing that i must comment on is Kodak needs to hirer better talent at programming their cameras firmware, while functional it feels like a bearly passing graduate slapped it together overnight and called it good.

I have a shaky hand and habitually take multiple shots of each picture to make sure that one is in focus.  The the colors on two pictures taken seconds apart displayed significant color differences.  Some pictures were clear with good contrast and color, but most were either grainy, washed out, or had poor color quality.We went snorkeling in Australia and used this camera first expecting it to fail miserably and throw it away. It was truly waterproof and I saw no evidence of moisture inside the camera after several days of use and opening and closing the battery compartment. 5 stars on waterproofness.  Picture quality was better than above water but was still hit or miss.  It didn't help that the screen brightness was too dim to accurately frame the pictures and I ended up just pointing and shooting in the general direction of the intended picture.

I didn't want to risk my feature-full higher end camera in a case to use in the water, on sandy beaches, rain etc as I've lost one that way before. After reading reviews and viewing customer images I bought the camera thinking that if it died one or two days in for this price I wouldn't be too put out. I was pleasantly surprised that it held up to all my abuse! I had no trouble getting it up and running and used it to take hundreds of photos and lots of video keeping it submerged in the ocean for hours at a time. I wasn't particularly careful with it, I knocked it about on boats, dropped it, got sand all over it, and I had absolutely no trouble.I would not use this as my main camera, as it lacks features/photo quality I desire. There is no zoom, and the flash seems weak. Kodak is not a brand I would regularly buy for a camera. As I said, this was only used on beaches and in the water; to supplement my normal vacation photos. Ultimately I had tons of fun with this camera.The menus are easy to use, and I could see them underwater well enough to switch between the shooting modes to use the video feature. Besides the lack of an optical zoom, the other drawback I would have to mention is the super slow processing time. I had a fast card in it, but the camera takes forever to process a photo. Don't expect to be able to shoot multiple shots close together. If there was a particular frame I was looking for I had to wait and shoot quickly, knowing I wouldn't be able to get in another for a while. Batteries lasted a long time - much longer than I had expected.If you're not serious enough about underwater photography to invest nearly $200 and want something to take fun photos with this is a wonderful camera, and priced right.", "Date": "September 26, 2011"}, {"Title": "good camera but had some problems with the paint", "Author": "feg", "ReviewID": "R3QOJYYXO128BY", "Overall": "3.0", "Content": "I bough this camera for my son, the blue one, he likes a lot, but right out of the box and put batteries the paint of the bottom began to fall off.", "Date": "September 26, 2011"}, {"Title": "Fun Camera", "Author": "ClarissaDay", "ReviewID": "R3K2VTOHESXW6Q", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "Bought this for my trip to Hawaii.

A DVD would be very helpful with instructions on how to take pictures at night, during sporting events, etc.  I had to play around with the buttons on the camera to figure out how to do these things.  Also, make sure there isn't water on the lens as you're taking pictures.  It will still take the picture but there will be a water droplet obscuring your picture.  The easy fix for that is to make sure you shake the camera off before you take your picture.Overall, I would recommend this camera.

Due the high cost of most dedicated cases ($500+ for our household camera, $2000+ for one of my work SLR's), we bought this camera solely for easy snapshots while kayaking at the lake. My expectations are not high for this sort of camera, and it manages to meet those expectations most of the time.  While it's great for the scrapbook shots,and perhaps printing 4x6's, expect to work harder and pay more attention to get some of those pictures.Pros:AA batteries.  I can't tell you how helpful this is, dealing with a proprietary battery out at the lake is an incredible pain in the neck.Simple button to turn off the flash. You need it with this camera, see the cons section.Simple button to adjust the exposure compensation.Large easy to see display. Even in the sun the display is easy to see.Splash proof - NOT waterproof.  One look at this thing and it's obvious it's going to take on water, too many exposed buttons.Small and rugged.Cons:Over exposes easily.  This camera will fire off the flash even in the slightest of shadows and as a result tends to make pictures a bit whited out.No lens cover.  Truly ridiculous, the camera is advertised for the water, why isn't there at least some kind of cheap cover to keep the water and fingerprints off the lens when your carrying it around?  The recessed lens makes it very difficult to clean the lens when it gets spots on it.Review time is fixed at 5 seconds.  Which means that you either have to shoot blind or wait those 5 seconds for the review to finish.  No buttons seem to make the camera kick back into the preview screen.No viewfinder.  I know this is the trend in most cameras, and I knew it didn't have one before ordering, but it really irritates the crap out of me.Factory float strap isn't a float strap.  I ordered the combo kit because it came with a float strap from the factory.  The assumption of course was that it would actually float the camera it came with, it doesn't.  Fortunately this is something I checked in a large bucket with an equal weight before going to the lake.Overall I would like to emphasize that this isn't too bad for a sub $70 camera.  If you want something that takes good pictures most every time, has a quick speed, is easy to get along with, and is water proof you need to at least move into the $200 range.

This one is digital and shoots video.Even though several reviews complained about leaking issues, I decided to risk it. If it leaked, I would return it.Well, we took it to Lake LBJ in Kingsland and to the Schlitterbahn in New Braunfels. Rode bots on the lake, swam in the lake, rode lots of the crazy Schlitterbahn rides during a 107 degree heat. Needless to say, this camera was pushed to it's limits with water and heat exposure, shaking and bumping, and going under water. Very sturdy, not perfect but still worked very well, I love this thing. Even shot some cool video while on the rides.Let me point out a couple of things:1. The focus is not perfect on real close shots but I can live with that. Further shots came out really good. I always used the auto settings the camera had. Sometimes the pictures were very slightly overexposed but nothing major. Probably because we were out on such bright days. 1 minute in Photoshop and it's easily adjusted.2. The flash worked great. I took a few indoors and to enhance people in the shade and they were nice.3. The video camera worked really good. From really dark to really light, the iris takes a moment longer to adjust but it's acceptable. The audio on the camera wasn't too bad either. The only problem I had was when telling the camera to record, it was so bright outside that it was kind of hard to see the screen and make sure it was recording. That is my only issue with the camera. You just have to really make sure you see the screen and see that it's recording.4. Changing modes like camera to video or the different flash modes was pretty easy and worked well.5. I did not change batteries while in the water. I put the high end AA batteries in it and used that camera a lot to take pictures and shoot video and play them back. The batteries lasted the whole trip and are still in the camera. Maybe others had the camera leak because of where or how they changed batteries. I don't know.Overall, I recommend this camera.

The pictures have great color for a point and shoot.  Even if you don't have the steadiest of hands, the photo quality comes out very nicely, even on moving targets such as kids riding quads, action shots or bumpy boat rides. As long as I am not taking pictures at 55 miles an hour on the freeway, my shots are turning out great. I don't use the video functions a whole lot, but even under water the sound isn't too shabby.  The ZOOM isn't very powerful, I have attempted to shoot from across the lake and it doesn't work out too well, but what do you expect from a $65 camera? I am not a pro by any means, but I'd say if you are within about 25 feet of your object you should get pretty good results.  The BATTERIES that came with it are kodak brand, and I am not sure if they were just old or what, but I got about 50 pictures out of the camera before I had to change.  We use RECHARGABLE 2500mAh AAs and we get about 300-500 pictures from those batteries, depending on how much you have it on just scrolling through looking at your shots (wasting battery life). I'd bet if you got the rechargeables that are specifically for digital cameras you would get even more.  This camera doesn't seem to be a battery hog like some I have owned in the past.All in all, this is a great camera for family trips, pools, rivers, lakes, water parks, and a pretty good everyday camera too if you just want something small to tuck into your purse or glovebox.", "Date": "August 1, 2011"}, {"Title": "Recommended for beach and poolside use", "Author": "PinoyDoc", "ReviewID": "R2DHRLXW10C7", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I found this camera with the following goals in mind: a sub-$100 camera with decent performance which will stand average use at the beach and pool. It met all these expectations and the pictures were pretty good. I would have preferred a brighter screen for use in bright sun, but at the same time I have used \"old style\" cameras in the not too distant past (with \"film\"--remember them?), and not having immediate feedback as the how the pictures will look was no big deal.  I am curious as to why there are some users who experienced water intrusion despite keeping the camera above the 3 meter/10 ft limit. I did not experience that problem, and was able to take satisfying pictures and video with no issues whatsoever. I wonder if some of these adverse events were due to somebody jumping into the pool while holding the camera (instead of descending via the steps or being handed the camera while already in the pool). I am inclined to believe that the \"shock\" can defeat the water resistant properties of the camera.

Now, I know why they're bankrupt. Like the majority of 1-star reviews, the camera leaked and shut down after only a few minutes in the water while swimming to a snorkling spot in the Caribbean. The camera was only inches beneath the surface and I took a couple of shots while swimming. Those were the only shots I got. When I reached the snorkling spot the camera would not turn on though I had loaded new batteries before starting. When I got back and opened the camera I poured about 1/4 teaspoon of water out of the battery compartment. Lense was fogged and water was in the viewing screen.Tried to contact Kodak by email but each time I clicked the submit button, the form cleared and had to start over.Finally called on phone and explained problem to tech. He said I could send it in for repair only (not replacement). He also said if they found I had abused camera they would advise me of the cost of repair and if I didn't agree to pay repair charges they would charge me $35.00 for trouble analysis.Then said they would send instructions for sending camera in shortly after we terminated phone call. It's been two days and only thing I got was a survey on what kind of job the tech did. Afrter a week, I called back and they sent the return instructions.Camera has not been abused though it's got scratches on it from being in my camera case with my DSLR. It's only been used once since I received it and that was a set of test pictures to make sure it worked. Otherwise, it's never been out of the camera bag. Paint on camera is VERY thin and scratches easily. Good way for Kodak to claim abuse.After thinking about it and considering other customer service complaints here, I don't think I'm gonna throw good money after bad by paying shipping to Kodak. I certainly will not pay a $35.00 fee for trouble shooting a camera that's still under warranty if they try to claim its been abused. Think I'll just hang the camera in a prominent place as a continuous reminder of my stupidity for buying a Kodak camera.Too late between purchase and first underwater use to return to Amazon.UPDATE (November 2012) Against my better judgment, I sent the camera back to Kodak. They returned it quickly with no charge other than the $12.00 cost of shipping it to them. Took it on a Caribbean cruise over Thanksgiving with plans to use it snorkling on Half Moon Cay in the Bahamas. The returned camera appeared to be the same one I sent it...same scratches on the case. Kodak repair added a \"refurbished\" sticker. Shot several great pix on shore and it worked fine. But, identically to the first experience, when I attempted to shoot pix in the water, camera was dead and water appeared inside the viewing screen. Warranty expired in August so no further hope from Kodak. Obviously way too late to send back to Amazon. So, I'm out of a $100 camera I paid $69.00 for.If you can find it on Half Moon Cay, you can have it. It wasn't even worth the added weight of bringing it back home.

Seems like this one could be a refurb and somebody forgot something?From PHENOM SAVINGS:The red one here is the only one that works as expected on land.  I gonna limit test it underwater soon.But you could see, the experience is not so great already.

I have been a photographer for a long time, so I am kind of spoiled, I own a Canon 60D and 4 or 5 lenses, so I am used to things working for me. I took some snorkeling pics this week at Trunk Bay St John, USVI, I will post them for review. The irritating thing is that for some reason every few seconds now the camera just shuts itself off, or goes to sleep, and its not the battery, also underwater its very hard to see anything on the LCD screen so you can't tell if the camera is off or on, you just have to point and hope. One time I took about 20 pics underwater and did not even realize the camera was off. I have had it for about 18 months now so manybe its some kind of degredation of the camera??? SO the difficulty of seeing the screen underwater and out of water in bright light is a big disadvantage for me, I am used to an eyepiece and this drives me nuts. So for these things I am taking off two stars. Otherwise the picture quality is good, it takes nice everyday landscape and portrait pics, and good underwater pics, so three stars for that.

I should have played around with it before going on vacation.  The instructions SUCK!  I spend almost the whole entire snorkeling time trying to figure out how to put it on underwater picture taking.  It is definitely NOT user friendly or perhaps I am just an idiot when it comes to cameras, which is a good possibility.  Even on the worst quality settings to take the most pictures it only takes about 18 pics unless you buy a memory card.  We took 18-I counted and it said internal memory full.  I know it wouldn't take that many, but 18!  Please, there was no way to download them on to a flashdrive at that time.  Then when you are in the water you can't see what you are taking pictures of, at least not in the ocean.  With a scuba mask on and the screen being so small you have to guess at what you are taking a picture of so we had to keep stopping and looking at the pics to see if we needed to delete them right away to fit more pics on the camera.  What a waste of snorling/vacation time.  Now the only reason I am giving it two stars and will update at a later date is because the pictures that  were taken look fantastic on the camera once you are standing on dry land in good light.  I have yet to download them to the computer to see the quality and we are in the process of getting the memory card.  The batteries last an ok amount of time considering all the time I spent trying to figure out what settings I needed to be on and which pics to delete constantly.  I liked the fact that it isn't a lithion battery that only lasts 30 minutes like the last pos we bought and returned.  We were able to keep a few extra batteries dry on land that we could switch out if we needed to.  So, I am going to see if I can play with it before our next use and try to figure out the ease and meaning of the buttons, get a memory card, download the pics to the computer, keep an eye on the life of the batteries during real use, and give a more realistic rating.

I purchased this camera to go white water rafting, barely saw any water-it broke! It's called \"sport\" is it not and it broke on the first rapid?! I get back very disappointed because I wanted to document my whole excursion but could not. \"Luckily\" it was in the 30 day period to return the camera. So I had to pay an additional 11 dollars to ship it back to them, then I had to wait 2 weeks to get it back \"refurbished\". I go into the pool yesterday in a CENTIMETER of water, just below the surface it took one photo and broke again! (mind you BOTH instances my camera was completely closed, I always am OCD about that, and it filled with water the first and second time) Two chances too many on this camera. Save yourself the annoyance and just splurge if you want a reliable camera. Plus the \"range\" of shooting of the camera is very narrow and you won't get a \"full\" scene. I am so angry at myself that it's a 100.00 down the drain. I hope this review helps you. Plus their customer service is below par. Now I'm out of the second 30 day range so I probably will not get my money back because I definitely do not want to get another one of these again-ever.P.S Amazon made me give it a star, it would be a 0 out of 5.", "Date": "September 3, 2012"}, {"Title": "MY CAMERA CAME WITH DEFECTS WATER", "Author": "Evelyn Soto", "ReviewID": "R1QXPK908XG8YM", "Overall": "1.0", "Content": "Hello good evening mr Warehouse Deals, Inc.. problems came with my camera and take a picture that is starting to sound the camera and the screen goes black and I have to withdraw the batteries to get it working again, and also when connected to the PC USB cable not recognized camera and will not let me download the pictures for automatically turns on and turns off the display of the screen .. then please do need answers on how to solve problems with my computer or know how to make the team repogan me! thanks!", "Date": "February 16, 2012"}, {"Title": "No audio playback from LCD", "Author": "misph1re", "ReviewID": "R2AASIR30SWGTH", "Overall": "1.0", "Content": "We got this camera for our son because he was always borrowing our camera to record video and then play it back.

I should have followed my own rules and not purchased a product for which more than 5% of the ratings are negative.  I thought my luck would be different.  I was wrong. Everything about the performance in the negative reviews came true for me.I received the camera 3 days before we left for vacation. I turned it on and tested it in dry circumstances. Everything worked fine. I did not have time to test it underwater before we left for vacation.  The day we arrived at our destination, I took it into a pool where the camera did not go more than 2 feet down.  It immediately started to break down after taking one photo in the following order:Screen would be too brightCamera would not allow me to view pictures takenCamera became slow to turn onCamera stopped turning onI followed recommendations of reviewers who stated the camera would work after it dried out.  That did not work. In fact, the LCD screen would show water in it and stopped working.  Also, water had seeped into the lense area and fogged it up.  After letting it dry out for another day, the canmera just ceased to work.  I checked the batteries thinking they shorted out, but they worked on a remote control and fresh batteries did not help.I have not spoken to Kodak to resolve this issue yet as I am still on vacation and do not want to waste my precious time with them.  I will update this posting once I have given them a chance to resolve this issue.Please take my advice! DO NOT BUY THIS CAMERA. I don't care how good of a price it is. If you have a 50/50 chance of it working, it is not worth the gamble. I've already lost percious moments of my family having fun because of the crappy quality. I am probably going to ogo back to using underwater film cameras for $10/camera.

Stec \"GLTPWR\"", "ReviewID": "R3ONTHYCMIWJDC", "Overall": "1.0", "Content": "This camera is not worth the incredibly low $69.00 price of entry.  Does it work underwater?  I don't know; I got my return label printed before such tests could be conducted.  The real issue with this camera is the photo quality.  I do not know if my unit was defective (and it could have been as it is a new camera and the new batch could have problems),but the photo quality is absolutely dreadful.  I am not even going to bother to compare this camera to real point and shoots from other reputable brands; the photo quality is noticeably inferior to a 3.2 megapixel Nokia 5530 XpressMusic.The Kodak does not have a real autofocus, so anything that is within 1 inch to 3 feet is out of focus.  The shutter release button further emphasizes that there is no autofocus because there is no detent that indicates that the camera would be focusing.  In other words, the camera button pushes down one level like any other button you use for things such as a tv remote or a car stereo.  Even the aforementioned Nokia has a detent that helps the camera find an autofocus point before you fully depress the shutter to take the picture.  Also, the camera seems to be blurry/out of focus in the center of the shot even when you change the focus setting between face recognition, center, or multiple points.Flash pictures are also poor because the flash will make the subject in the center (which is already out of focus) very bright while any other part of the shot is incredibly dark.  It is very poor when compared to flash shots taken with other cameras, including the Nokia.Like other Kodak cameras, this one also has serious compression issues.  The pictures may be 12 megapixels, but the file size is typically around 2-2.5 MB.  My 12 megapixel Panasonic Lumix DMC-ZS6 takes pictures that typically range from 4.5-5.5 MB in size.  While compression may sound like a nice memory space-saving feature, it noticeably lowers the quality of any details that are actually in focus in the shot.The camera also has serious noise reduction, which tries to lessen the grain you get in photos taken at a high ISO.  However, the noise reduction on this camera is so severe that it noticeably softens the portions of the shot that are in focus (if you can get portions of the shot in focus) so that you lose even more detail (and this is on top of the severe compression).In sum, this camera is an extremely disappointing product that is not worth more than $40.  My camera phone takes FAR better pictures, and I don't even want to begin to compare the Kodak's shortcomings to the superb photo quality of my Panasonic DMC-ZS6 or my Nikon D3000 DSLR.  If you want an acceptable entry level camera, buy a Canon Powershot A490 and stay out of the water.  Otherwise, spend the extra money and buy a Panasonic Lumix TS10 or an Olympus Tough Series camera.
