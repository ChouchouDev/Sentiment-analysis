All the menus are in Japanese, some have English words in them in addition to the Japanese, most don't.  All the buttons are labelled in English.  I wonder who this is targeted towards.Awesome pictures, but very difficult to use as I can't read Japanese.  If this wasn't so packed with features I could probably figure it out.I requested a return \"Does not match description\" and within 20 seconds got an authorization to return.  Based on the pictures I took I immediately ordered  Panasonic DMC ZS30K Megapixel Digital Camera and very much look forward to it.The zoom is exceptional and even with my shakey hands at full zoom the pictures are blur free due to the image stabilization.The cable needed to charge it (it does not come with an external battery charger) is a type of micro USB I have never seen before.  If you are in a harsh environment (I live on the ocean) do yourself a favor and get a spare cable, better yet, the two batteries with external charger.  This thing takes 3 1/2 hours to charge on the USB cable.", "Date": "August 17, 2013"}, {"Title": "Confused...do you speak Japanese?", "Author": "Dr. Oceanfront \"Oceanfront\"", "ReviewID": "R3BQT7DNE81IRV", "Overall": "3.0", "Content": "I wanted to buy my son a very light camera for his upcoming trip to Asia.  I have always heard great things about the Lumix, and he got a smoking deal on it, so I told him to buy it and I would pay for it as a birthday present...this is it, the TZ-40.I tried to play with it, but I could not get anywhere as the instructions are not in English, nor is anything else.Luckily my son is very tech savvy and I think he may just figure this guy out.  If not, no problem, as this is an easy return.My son said he could find the instructions on the web, and actually found the Japanese instructions kind of cool.  Go figure.I will change the rating as soon as I know more about the camera.  But I will say, at the price I paid, this sure has some great features and takes some nice pictures!To be continued...Update:  it is the ZS (not TZ) that is the American model.If my review helped you, please click on \"Helpful\" below.

I can't for the life of me figure the reviews about Japanese menus, but figure Amazon may have purchased a bunch intended for the Japanese market that weren't defaulted to english language. Ignore all these reviews. I had to change language to Japanese on mine to see what they were talking about, and was able to change it back to English simply enough but had not considered the menuing to be problematic until I tried operating it in Japanese (easily fixed).The zoom on this camera is nothing short of breath-taking. I am regularly having to rest both elbows to get stability but this is clearly a physics thing, not a limitation of the camera.The camera is fast, works ok in low light (keeping in mind it's not an f/1.8) and the smarts are not overly intrusive. Panoramic is good (multi-directional, good guides etc...) and I without flash, I rarely bite into a second battery taking 400-600 shots.For anyone looking to travel, or with kids - I reckon this is the camera.  In fact - I would argue that >80% of the people lugging around a DSLR should shelve it and take a TZ40 with a spare battery or two.And if you have never tried a compact super-zoom camera, then just order one. Don't bother researching or vascilating, just go and grab one.
