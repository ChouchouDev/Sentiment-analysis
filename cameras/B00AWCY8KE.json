{"Reviews": [{"Title": "Finally found my camera", "Author": "Margaret Noble", "ReviewID": "RLJUKP6VCD3OK", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I grew up with an Olympus OM-1 as my go-to SLR film camera.  When it came to the point where I wanted to get a digital SLR, I kept looking but not buying.  Asked myself what I really wanted, and the answer was, my old Olympus, only digital!  So I researched and found this camera.  There's a newer version out now, but I am more than happy with this one, which you can use as if it's your old manual camera, or operate on any of a number of automatic and cool, artistic settings.  There's another review in the line-up that really goes into detail about all the tech specs and specific features, so search for that, but my review is A-plus.", "Date": "December 26, 2013"}], "ProductInfo": {"Price": "$1,319.95", "Features": "KIT INCLUDES 14 PRODUCTS -- All BRAND NEW Items with all Manufacturer-supplied Accessories + Full USA Warranties:\n<1> Olympus OM-D E-M5 Micro 4/3 Digital Camera & 12-50mm Lens (Silver/Black) + <2> Olympus M.Zuiko 40-150mm Lens + <3> Transcend 32GB Class10 SD Card +\n<4> Spare BLN-1 Battery & Charger + <5> Vivitar 52mm UV Glass Filter + <6> Vivitar 58mm UV Glass Filter +\n<7> Zeikos 50\" Compact Tripod + <8> PD 2.5x Tele & .45x Wide Lens + <9> PD-C20 Camera/Camcorder Case + <10> PD 6pc Complete Cleaning Kit +\n<11> PD SDHC Memory Card Reader + <12> PD Memory Card Storage Wallet + <13> LCD Monitor Screen Protectors + <14> Image Recovery Software", "Name": "Olympus OM-D E-M5 Micro 4/3 Digital Camera & 12-50mm Lens (Silver/Black) with M.Zuiko 40-150mm Zoom Lens + 32GB Card + Case + Battery & Charger + Tripod + Lens Set + Accessory Kit", "ImgURL": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/61F9UiWdsBL._SY300_.jpg", "ProductID": "B00AWCY8KE"}}
