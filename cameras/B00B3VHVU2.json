{"Reviews": [{"Title": "Great  bundle", "Author": "Timothy Hamade", "ReviewID": "R3QRC0NWS1BB6X", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "Great digital SLR package. I leaned photography using a Nikon F series. this camera bundle is lighter (plastic) and more compact. But still gives me a excellent shooting platform. The picture quality is impressive. A nondescript camera bag is a plus, as are the UV filters and 32gb SDHC card. Included screen protectors are more generic than I hoped for. Cameta Camera, thus far, has excellent customer service, Purchase was expedient, delivery was a couple of days before the stated date, though shipping was by train across country (I assume), one dent in outer package, but no noted damage with the factory package. Second thoughts would have me put more money into my bundle for a 70-300mm zoom, but the 55-200mm will meet most of my needs. I will recommend this seller.", "Date": "August 10, 2013"}], "ProductInfo": {"Price": "$919.95", "Features": "KIT INCLUDES 12 PRODUCTS -- All BRAND NEW Items with all Manufacturer-supplied Accessories + Full USA Warranties:\n<1> Nikon D5200 Digital SLR Camera & 18-55mm G VR DX AF-S Zoom Lens (Black) + <2> Nikon 55-200mm VR DX AF-S Lens + <3> Transcend 32GB Class10 SD Card +\n<4> Vivitar 52mm UV Glass Filter + <5> Additional Vivitar 52mm UV Glass Filter + <6> ML-L3 Shutter Remote Control +\n<7> PD Digital SLR Camera Case + <8> Precision Design 58\" Tripod + <9> PD SDHC Memory Card Reader +\n<10> PD 6pc Complete Cleaning Kit + <11> PD Memory Card Storage Wallet + <12> LCD Monitor Screen Protectors", "Name": "Nikon D5200 Digital SLR Camera & 18-55mm G VR DX AF-S Zoom Lens (Black) with 55-200mm VR Lens + 32GB Card + Battery + Case + Filters + Tripod + Accessory Kit", "ImgURL": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/51pX-jgyO8L._SY300_.jpg", "ProductID": "B00B3VHVU2"}}
