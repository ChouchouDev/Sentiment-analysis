It does really well with light, but not so well in darkness. If you want to make a video in a dark setting, it is a good idea to go out and get an LED flash light, or find a way to get some light on the subject. Both Amazon and Ebay sell the LED lighting camera accessory. Also, in order to remove the sound from the video, I ran it through Microsoft's movie maker. Movie Maker can edit videos in HD also, and it's free from Windows. However, that would only be the Windows 7 and 8 editions.", "Date": "June 16, 2013"}, {"Title": "decent camera but surprisingly less intuitive than previous model", "Author": "Catherine", "ReviewID": "R2GOQSQY50Z4P2", "Overall": "3.0", "Content": "This is my third Canon Powershot Elph, so obviously, I'm a fan of this model.  Between my 1st & 2nd (3 years), i saw a HUGE improvement in sharpness (MP)& zoom, also it was SO intuitive (in particular automatically \"brightening\" a dim shot (when i didn't want to use flash) & for close-up/macro shots) that I was able to rely on auto setting for all my picture taking needs. When i lost the 2nd camera on vacation, I tried to see the glass as half full & anticipated a even SMARTER, more intuitive camera.  This was listed as the newest model of the one I had lost (with better MP & zoom), but unfortunately, I have found that it's actually LESS intuitive - the auto focus gets confused easily (I would say 15-20% of simple/still pictures come out blurry) & the flash doesn't go off about 20% of the time I think it should, sure these percentages are relatively low but it makes me worry about missed photo opportunities in fleeting moments.  Also, I was annoyed to find that this camera doesn't come with a transfer cord (to plug into usb)or a memory card.  Granted, the measly memory card that came with the previous models were useless but as another reviewer mentioned - then this should be mentioned in the item description.  The item description also doesn't mention transferring photos at all (I haven't read the manual (the camera comes with a quick guide, but if you want the full manual, you have to go online) & maybe this is one of those wifi cameras where you can transfer photos to your smart phone or tablet wirelessly - but this shouldn't eliminate the option of doing it manually).  Luckily, the camera does have the same \"port\" as the previous model so i was able to use my old transfer cords but there is NO REASON why that shouldn't be included with the camera. On the upside, this camera is smaller, lighter-weight & more streamline, but for my money - i'd rather it be the same size as before & function better.", "Date": "August 20, 2013"}, {"Title": "excellent video quality", "Author": "Karen D \"Bibliophile\"", "ReviewID": "R1RHERF3A869LO", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "I bought this just to have a point & shoot still camera for my vacation.

Hentze", "ReviewID": "R67TA4EOY0B5H", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "The Canon PowerShot ELPH 115 is a low cost, no-frills, budget point and shoot camera, with a rather long range lens. The camera originally sold for between $129-$169 dollars, and got mediocre reviews. Recently the price dropped to $79.95, which makes it a real bargain. Canon has cut some corners with the ELPH 115 though. You don't get a USB cable. The screen is only 2.7\", and has a modest 230K resolution. The settings are pretty limited, but you get some different shooting modes. Auto mode works well under most conditions. Picture quality outdoors is pretty good for a tiny sensor camera. Picture quality indoors is not so good. The flash is weak, and anything above ISO 200 produces noisy results. The 720p video is good. Refresh time between shots is a little slow. Battery life is average. I got about 150 shots before I needed to recharge. By far the best part of the Canon PowerShot ELPH 115 is the wide angle 8X zoom lens. A few years ago, a lens with this range wasn't available in a tiny point and shoot camera at any cost. The Canon PowerShot ELPH 115 is far from a perfect camera, but as one of the cheapest point and shoot cameras out there. It's very good for the price. For $20 more though, you can get the Canon PowerShot ELPH 130. It's the same camera, but adds a better screen and WiFi. I give Canon PowerShot ELPH 115 \"4 Stars\" for having a big lens and small price tag.Pros:Price.Wide Angle 8X Zoom Lens.Good results in good lighting.Good Auto Mode.Good Image Stabilization.Small size.Cons:USB Cable not included.No internal memory or SD Card included.Print manual not included.Fair-poor results in low lighting.Low resolution screen.Limited user settings.Buttons might be too small for some.", "Date": "March 14, 2014"}, {"Title": "Power shot", "Author": "Madeline Dunn", "ReviewID": "R2SHFD6DY8X0EL", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "Had a Canon before, liked the simplicity of using it.

While the menus may not be intuitive, the user interface - automatic focus and exposure make it possible for a two year old to use it, and to take some pretty good photos.  EVERYONE wants to pose for a two year old photographer.  Pretty fun,When she's not using it,  I  carry it around in my pocket.  I know that there is the potential for getting a stuck lens, but for <$80, I'm willing to take that chance. If you don't have a camera with you, you just don't get the shots you want.

It has a battery and charger, so you won't have to buy a bunch of batteries, but that also means you can't use it while the battery is charging unless you buy a a second one. I mostly use it to take pictures for eBay, usually it takes clear pics whether close up or far away. However, it does tell me I'm not holding still enough most of the time, and occasionally I get blurred pictures, even when I try to hold still. It works well for what I use it for, but if you are used to a more high tech camera, or you are using it for motion shots (like for kids or pets), you may want to consider a slightly higher priced alternative.", "Date": "June 2, 2014"}, {"Title": "very good camera", "Author": "Chih Ming Chen", "ReviewID": "RNN2MLTFEAP07", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "Very good camera, small and light to carry.photo quality is excellence!camera appearance is cute too, I love it", "Date": "June 2, 2014"}, {"Title": "Pretty good camera", "Author": "Hope Russell \"HopeR\"", "ReviewID": "R2TAWK9O9DIRL", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "The options are standard for point & shoot camera.

This camera has no such setting. I really never used any other setting on my old one. The pictures were clear and color was great. But after 6 months, I tried to use it and the whole screen froze up. I had to take out the battery a few times to get it to even retract the lens back into the camera! Now it is nothing but trouble. It works only half the time and the other half I am messing with it to get it to unfreeze and taking the battery out to get it to reset.

I wanted a new \"work\" point & shoot (aka P&S;) camera that I could easily get the pictures off of it without the hassle of carrying around some special cable for. At around $80, this really fit the bill.I have yet to take this P&S; camera on a project with me, although I have several international projects coming up soon this summer put it to a real test, the meager testing I have done with it so far, this camera is exceeding my expectations. It takes great pictures in very low light conditions! I'm actually surprised how good the pics come out. Of course, it doesn't compare to my T3i with the right lens on it, but for a P&S; camera that costs under $100, I am honestly surprised. My DSLR setup is peaking around $4000, which is my \"goto\" camera for my international amateur photography travel pictures. Having said that, I really want to know how well it does when there is a bright source of light in one small area and the rest of the scene is actually very dark. I won't know until my next project. Just try to take pictures of cutting steel via a flame cutting torch with anything other than an expensive DSLR, it's really not so easy. And everyone in my industry carries around thousands of dollars of photography equipment around just waiting to get damaged by the actual process. Yeah, not going to happen. If a camera that costs less than $100 can get the job done, then if it gets damaged... well... no big deal.Anyway. My previous \"work\" P&S; camera was a Sony, and had a memory card that could not be inserted into most laptops. Especially any newer ones. I always had to carry around a special cable just to get the pics off the thing. This was a real pain in the arse. And when you travel internationally as much I do, the less junk you can carry the better you can pack for the trip.There is a chance I might be reimbursed by my company for this purchase, but even if my company decides not to reimburse the $80 I'm out of pocket for this P&S; camera, it will not break the bank (plus an additional $12 for a 16G SD card).This P&S; camera fits my needs so far. A memory card that will work in my DSLR, as well as this P&S.; Also can be inserted into almost any laptop.

Let me use my usual disclaimer, in the interest of fairness, and admit that many cameras by reputable makers (and there are many) deliver what they promise. It is more about what camera traits you are looking for. So, I would suggest to anyone looking to buy one to google 'camera trait search' and get the whole picture.The ELPH110 is a fixed lens camera (point and shoot, some would say), with 16.1 resolution (megapixels), and a x8 zoom. The sensor size is 1/2.3 inch CCD-type, which is standard for cameras of its class.If you were to, say, take pictures of friends and family at an outdoor gathering, this camera is what you need. If you get ambitious, there will be stumbling blocks. Here is the camera's trait mix: It does not have a viewfinder, which, again, many in its class don't. The ISO rating, which is the gauge for how well it does in low light, is 1600. That rating is lower than many others, but it is sufficient for most purposes. The video is a Full HD- that is 1980x1080 resolution. It does not have a hot shoe for an external flash option. That is not unexpected for its size and category. The LCD screen is a 230,000 resolution. The camera does not do RAW processing but you would need only if you did not want to be limited by JPEG type storage. The burst rate is a reasonable 2.9 frames per second- great for quick shots. The weight of the camera is a convenient 133 grams.Overall, nice, fun camera. Having been into photography for a while, I do stress though that you do a camera trait search.

I paid $89.99 at Best Buy. I love this camera. I can take good pictures, record clear HD videos (record up to 20 minutes or more. Depending on which SD Memory Card), and I can zoom the scene 8x with the optical zoom to take a close up picture. When the battery go dead, all I have to do is recharge the battery, This is the best digital camera ever. The camera have a speaker for you to listen to the sounds after you record a video and review it. The last digital camera I had was the Kodak Easyshare C180. I had that camera for 3 years. I had to get away from the Kodak Easyshare C180 because the pictures would always come out dark (picture quality was terrible), the video came out blur after recording a video and converting it from the MOV to AVI on a computer, it didn't have a speaker on the camera when you get ready to review the video, the optical zoom was only 3x, and I have to always keep buying AA batteries to stock up.And, the first digital camera I had was a Polaroid a530 Digital Camera back in 2009. In 2010, the Polaroid Digital Camera had fell and dropped to the floor so hard (ceramic tile) that it had cracked the screen and broke. The Polaroid Digital Camera didn't have the optical zoom; only the digital zoom. Sometimes the pictures would come out blurred or very dark. And you can only record videos up to 1 minutes. The Canon PowerShot ELPH 115 16MP Digital Camera is way better than the other digital cameras. If you're looking for a better digital camera to buy, I highly recommend the Canon PowerShot ELPH 115 16MP Digital Camera is the best one to buy.", "Date": "February 23, 2014"}, {"Title": "It's perfect.", "Author": "JJFG", "ReviewID": "R3JFD56981AOL7", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I have two months using the camera and is perfect, the images and videos are stunning, I love this camera", "Date": "February 21, 2014"}, {"Title": "What I Wanted!", "Author": "J.C.", "ReviewID": "R21FM0NU8MDTA", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "This camera fully met my needs and expectations.

The AUTO setting works quite well for most situations and it's a nice small camera to have in my purse or pocket all the time.  My only complaint is that (as far as I can tell) the only way to choose the focus point (rather than having the camera try to identify what you want to photograph) is to have it set on Program, which means I also have to set other attributes.  My finesse for this has been to Program a fairly \"standard\" setting so that I usually can switch quickly over to \"P\" to get the \"focus box.\"  Under most conditions, that works pretty well.  And really, for the low cost, the quality of the pictures, length of battery charge, ease of use, are all very good.  The AUTO sensor does a good job of finding faces, identifying low light, sunset, close ups, and other common situations.  I just wish I could lock in a focus point then compose the picture as I could on other cameras.  Also be warned that the camera does not come with a battery charger.  I always buy a second battery (so I don't miss pictures due to the battery running out) so I purchased one that came with a charger so that wasn't a huge deal for me - but something you should be aware of before buying it.  Otherwise you have to charge the battery while it's in the camera and your camera is out of commission for that time period.", "Date": "January 14, 2014"}, {"Title": "Canon PowerShot ELPH 115 IS16MP Digital Camera", "Author": "WBOGGS", "ReviewID": "R30IMV6JH300LQ", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I love this camera .... it does more than I expected.Takes clear and crisp pictures.Great camera for the price.W.Boggs ....

O.K., so I'm In the dark and I'm trying to feel for the little ring with the button on the middle and the menu button in the corner and I find these things OK but when the displays come up there's all this BS about smile detector and red eye yada yada  and then always, whenever I want to try a picture without the flash and I can never figure out a simple way to turn flash on and off, and it's just  just hit and miss, so sometimes when I finally get it turned off then I can't turn it back on again though usually it goes back to automatic by default.And then there were settings that COULD have been useful for what I was trying to do like a low light setting and another setting to leave the shutter open longer and that one always likes to get set by accident so when I'm trying to capture a picture in a hurry and the shutter takes forever. Bottom line was that from fiddling around with it I managed to blunder into the right settings ONCE out of 10 pics and got one decent picture but have no idea how I did it.There needs to be a  separate \"SET\" button apart from the button in the middle of the ring which seems to have multiple functions and the ring itself does things other than let you highlight functions.The camera is good quality but is a nightmare for a non-techie to try to operate.
