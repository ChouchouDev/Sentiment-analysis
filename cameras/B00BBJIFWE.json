For a point and shoot camera the DV150 produces good crisp, sharp, clean pictures. It is easy to use and easy to navigate the menu. The video this camera takes is also clean and crisp. Even though it shoots 720p resolution you will not be dis appointed. As with any point and shoot camera lighting is important when using the video function. The lower the lighting the \"grainier\" the video will look. Also make sure you get a Class 10 card for your camera. Why you ask well it is simple, you want a card that has a fast \"read/write\" speed so your video and pictures will come out as good as possible. Some people may say you do not need a class 10 but they are wrong!! I use Sandisc cards myself do not buy a \"no name\" card I know that they are cheaper but you get what you pay for. So stick with a brand name class 10 card you will not regret it. Overall this point and shoot camera is a great buy, is it the best? no, but you will be pleased with this camera. Looking for a Vlogging camera? This camera will do the job! As mentioned before it records up to 720p and has a small LCD screen on the front to help you get into frame. Great camera at a great price.", "Date": "July 21, 2013"}, {"Title": "This Tiny Camera Is A Titan In Disguise", "Author": "charger", "ReviewID": "R33T0M8LNZZG0G", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I bought this camera because I wanted an easy to use Point and Shoot Digital Camera. I relied on the many reviews to make my purchase. There were many  positive reviews, and the only negative review that appeared many times was this camera does not take take great Flash pictures, and there is a lag with the use of the Flash. Well Out of many flash pics that I took, I had one, but all of my flash pics came out great. I have not learned how to use all of the functions like the WiFi that will send a pic to a nearby Smartphone, but for the price I paid, I am well pleased and satisfied. This camera came with no driver for the PC because it doesn't need one. This is great because many times when you buy a new P.C. you will have lost the Driver Disk. We really liked the front screen that lets you get those personal portrait shots with looking stupid, or using a mirror. The little animated video in the front screen is just an added touch for capturing the excitement of young children.

It has a lot of fun features such as diferent filters and frames you can put into your pictures, which is fun.  The photos come out clear and it has a fairly fast shutter speed in regular shooting mode.  I had no problem connecting to the internet or sending pictures to my phone and e-mail address.  I really like the live panoramic mode of this camera, it is by far the easiest panoramic picture mode I have used.  While it is true that it doesnt come with a lot of written instruction, I registered mine with Samsung when it arrived and they sent me the links to download the manual as well as to their tip and trouble shooting pages.  Also, the camera itself pretty much walks you through set up and what the different modes are.  It also notified me of a firmware update which I was able to easily download.  So far I am pretty impressed with this camera.  The only reason I didnt give it a 5 star rating is that the zoom is not the best.  Its okay, but I have a Fuji which has a much better zoom feature.", "Date": "November 12, 2013"}, {"Title": "I totally endorse Samsung Cameras", "Author": "Giselle", "ReviewID": "R1FHDQHZ0SJ2UW", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "This is my 3rd Samsung Camera.

No.  But when my 6 year old Sony Cybershot camera and my iPhone take better pictures than a brand new camera I question why I even bought it.

The front LCD screen is nice...you can make sure everything you want is in the shot! There is not an ungodly lag between pictures (major plus).I love this little camera!

When enabling the Wi-Fi connectivity you can download the app from Play Store/App Store in your smartphone and when just finishing taking the picture, it immediately send it to your smartphone.  The only bad thing of this feature is that you can't take another picture until it finishes sending the picture you have taken to your phone.

The Wifi connectivity is much better in this model, so emailing and uploading pictures to Facebook is much better. In the Dv300f the wifi is hit or miss....which is really strange. This one has all the options, plus some as the Dv300f. The beauty palette is a fun feature to have too! I think the only option it doesn't have that the dv300f does, is the funny face app that warps your face. You really don't need that anyway!It's a fun little camera!

Now we can see exactly what the photo will look like.  You push a button on the top to activate the front screen, and the camera seems a little slower processing when the front screen is activated, so we don't have it active unless we are using that feature.It is simple to use, yet has great options and takes great pictures.  There is a \"Smart Auto\" setting, and then there are also more detailed \"scene\" settings for different situations.  We like to play with the settings to see what works best in the situation we are in.  A great zoom for \"faraway closeups\", but not at night.  The flash doesn't go very far, so you're best to take faraway photos without the flash at night because it takes better advantage of what light is REALLY there -- if you use the flash at night, it makes things farther away look darker than they really are.We are really happy with the camera, and would definitely recommend it.  It was just a LITTLE more expensive than others, but the front screen makes that well worth it to us.  :-)  Oh, and you can also set the timer to take a delay picture if you are taking it from farther away, and you could still have the front screen activated so you could see right away, who needs to move in or to the side, or stop putting \"bunny ears\" over someone else's head ;-)", "Date": "June 6, 2014"}, {"Title": "Poor Quality", "Author": "steve scavotto", "ReviewID": "R1LVX3NB3L31FT", "Overall": "1.0", "Content": "This Camera SUX.........That's an overstatement, It is truly a piece of crap.

As for basic \"auto\" picture taking, it is about par to a $50.00 Kodak camera but, the video quality is much better. Having a front facing LCD is a nice touch for those (many) selfies we all like to take. The rear LCD is okay but, in direct sunlight, a bit difficult to see the image. I also wish I had full control of the flash which is not an option.THE REALLY GOOD: There are many preset-able picture formats so you don't have to make manual adjustments. This includes changeable MPs (picture size/quality) and specific scene choices as well as \"magic\" mode to add enhancements to pictures and even correct facial imperfections. There is a panoramic function to capture those vast scenic moments too. Also, with a 5X optical zoom, you can get pretty good close-ups (try not to move the camera!). With these capabilities and more, this camera is a winner!I haven't used the wifi since I find it easier just to take a picture with smart phone and send it immediately from the phone.FYI: If you wait a couple of seconds after selecting an item within the menu, the camera will show a little pop-up describing its function. I mention this because the camera does not come with a manual which is only available/downloadable online.Overall, this appears to be a solid, well-built camera with a good lens and many user changeable features.", "Date": "January 16, 2014"}, {"Title": "Camera for my daughter", "Author": "Bobbi Bradshaw", "ReviewID": "RBBYWX81TIRYP", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "She loves it & it works great!

It also does not take good pictures in dark areas. And last when uploading pictures to your computer it does not let you pick which ones to upload. It uploads all of them.

There is a full manual available on various websites, but it has 100+ pages so I only printed the pages that I needed.)*I had to buy a memory card in addition to the camera.*Not \"user friendly\" if you have limited experience with digital cameras.", "Date": "November 27, 2013"}, {"Title": "Bad product", "Author": "DEISI GONZALEZ ROJAS", "ReviewID": "R3RKNSFUE54KBG", "Overall": "1.0", "Content": "Good morning please review products before sending them, I just got the camera and the lens tries to leave but gets stuck and fails, to bad I lost my money on this product, please re-checked for the products so that the customer does not waste time or money.", "Date": "April 7, 2014"}, {"Title": "Birthday Gift", "Author": "Willard D.

Actually, I stumbled across this one and was immediately impressed with the specs (16 megapixels and it being wi-fi). I knew I wanted a good quality of megapixel and wi-fi to seamlessly upload to social media and email without having to attach the cam to my laptop.What I love:A front AND rear LCD screen.The plum color is stunning and it is wi-fi.What I hate:The pic quality sucks.Rear LCD screen is supposedly 2.7 but looks incredibly small.  Worse, it wouldn't connect to my home wi-fi network. I tried it at least 5 to six times. Called Samsung tech support and the rep told me to try to connect via a different wi-fi network (How could I as I have one network at home and all my neighbor's are security protected?). Then I was told to try to disable my network security key THEN try to connect (This is impossible and makes no sense as how could one connect to a wi-fi without its security key?). Subsequently, in another phone call, a very rude and nasty tech support rep told me to change the channel of my router to \"either 1 or 6 but not 11\" and when asked how to go about doing that, I was told that they couldn't offer assistance in that and I'd have to contact my ISP. I contacted my ISP only to be told that only the manufacturer of the router could assist. Frustrated, I googled how to change my router's channel. HUGE MISTAKE! This erased all my router's settings (my network security key, network name, etc) as well as also rendering my internet offline and unable to have internet access. After a 4 and a half hour and 2 phone call tech session with the manufacturer of my router, I FINALLY was able to restore my internet connectivity. The rep stated that Samsung should have NEVER told me under any circumstances to alter my router's settings. Finally, the router tech support rep disabled a certain feature in the router settings and I was able to connect to my wi-fi network (or so I thought).....WRONG! After hanging up with the rep, I was once again, unable to connect with my wi-fi network. Clearly the cam was either defective or there is some setting on the cam or my network that prohibits or doesn't allow the cam to connect with my network.  The customer service/support I received from Samsung was appallingly sub-par. Unacceptable for a company with the supposed stellar reputation as Samsung. (I own a Samsung Galaxy Note II). Consequently, I returned the camera and will either purchase a Nikon or Canon. The 8 megapixel camera on my phone was of a more superior quality than this cam! The only reason I gave it two instead of one star is because of the color, features and potential. Be warned as 100 bucks is by no means a cheap investment for a point and shoot.", "Date": "January 9, 2014"}, {"Title": "Pure junk", "Author": "Alexander", "ReviewID": "R3N8HFYWL0GZL3", "Overall": "1.0", "Content": "Bought it, returned it.

Setup was easy, but the actual process of uploading pictures was cumbersome and took way too long.  Must have been 5+ steps and each time you have to connect to a wi-fi network.  Not only that, but the picture quality was terrible.  It is possible we weren't optimizing the pictures we were taking, but this is a point and shoot camera.  That is all I wanted to use it for.  Leave it in auto, point and shoot.  We were coming from a Canon Powershot SD1000 that was several years old.  Well, I am glad we hung on to the Canon, because I ended up selling this Samsung camera on that auction site and going back to the Canon.

My attraction to it was the front LCD screen, as I was going to a wedding that my young nephews were attending.  I thought the front screen would be fun for them and I thought it was an interesting feature.Being in the camera business for forty years, I knew I wasn't buying a $5,000 camera.  I DID expect to get a basic point and shoot camera that could create an acceptable 5 X 7 inch print.  As it turns out, I am ill that I took this camera to the wedding rather than buying a $5 disposable film camera or simply using my iPhone.Other problems with the camera are that the battery only lasts about 200 images before it has to be recharged again; it requires that you recharge the battery while inside the camera, as there is no separate AC charger provided;  the built in flash only has a range of about 8 feet even as 400 ISO; and it uses a micro SD card, which should have been clearly disclosed in the Amazon write-up. I had to run to Radio Shack to buy a micro SD card, which was ridiculously expensive.Do not waste your money on this camera.  EVERY one of the 200 images I took tonight are not sharp enough for 4 X 6 prints.  If you are ONLY going to view the images you create on an iPhone you are viewing from 5 feet away, then possibly consider it only if you are real fan of useless bells and whistles.", "Date": "November 9, 2013"}, {"Title": "do not buy this item, blotchy focus", "Author": "John Kerr", "ReviewID": "R15VILMXTISSZS", "Overall": "2.0", "Content": "the focus is blotchy, turns out a friend has one also, and their camera is also blotchy in its focus, do not buy this item", "Date": "October 29, 2013"}, {"Title": "Dont buy this, it's cheapo and has bad quality!", "Author": "P.
