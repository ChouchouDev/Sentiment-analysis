However when it arrived it was nothing like I expected. The description stated it includes a 35mm camera and with a flashlight. What arrived was a compass with binoculars and a spyglass. Also the little purple pouch shown on the picture was not included. It is not a an adventure kit, but a 3 piece exploring kit. I was deceived by the item description and will not be buying from this seller again.", "Date": "December 19, 2013"}, {"Title": "Item not as described", "Author": "Ajay A.", "ReviewID": "R2PPNW54V044NS", "Overall": "1.0", "Content": "Should've heeded to the reviews.
