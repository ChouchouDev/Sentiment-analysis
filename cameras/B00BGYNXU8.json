{"Reviews": [{"Title": "Awesome..such a well made throwback camera!  Love it.", "Author": "Corvette \"Terry\"", "ReviewID": "R2QJZXNUOANLGJ", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I purchased this camera for my 9yr. old grandson who is very impatient and needs instant gratification. This camera was perfect. He uses it all the time. He likes to see pictures in print form and you can still take digital photos with a couple of steps..The pictures are clear and the color is very good for what he uses it for. He takes pictures of the dogs, people, and things that interest him, all his friends love it.He used it all summer, and sent photos home with everyone who visited.  It really is fun.Only negative...comes with NO film...so make sure and order some.", "Date": "October 15, 2013"}, {"Title": "It is a smaller polaroid with smaller pictures - nothing special", "Author": "Cindy E", "ReviewID": "R1NDBEH3H4QGT", "Overall": "3.0", "Content": "I bought this for my granddaughter knowing that immediately seeing and holding a picture was very gratifying for a young giirl.  I thought the camera also had the ability to store the pictures digitally - it does not!  Also, the pictures are significantly smaller than the instant camera pictures I remember from the 70's and 80's.  Also, film is quite expensive - running approximately $1.00 a picture or more.", "Date": "January 9, 2014"}], "ProductInfo": {"Price": "$69.00", "Features": "Polaroid PIC 300 Purple Instant Camera", "Name": "Polaroid PIC 300 Purple Instant Camera", "ImgURL": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/4130yyV8mML._SY300_.jpg", "ProductID": "B00BGYNXU8"}}
