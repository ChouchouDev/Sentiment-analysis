Oliver \"Desert Denizen\"", "ReviewID": "RS9B32QKZQ6XH", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I bought this camera for its portability, because I so often failed to have a camera with me when a great shot presented itself. I wasn't expecting too much, but was really surprised.The image quality is nothing short of amazing. The lens seems to have few aberrations anywhere in its very wide zoom range. I don't use the longer focal lengths much but really appreciate that it has the equivalent of 24 mm at the wide-angle end.This spring has been good for wildflowers here in the desert. I have taken many shots of plants for identification as well as working with flower macros, trying to achieve some \"artsy\" shots. I'm very happy with the results.I've also done some videos, notably one of ants being very busy. Looks great on the big screen at 1080p, even though the camera only takes 720.Of the multitudes of features, the best is wi-fi connectivity. Whenever the computer is on I can let it update the files on the PC. It makes folders for each day automatically and remembers what has already been saved. Works up to hundreds of feet from the router.It has a \"smart\" mode which makes all the decisions for you, a \"program\" mode with more control, and fully manual. The manual mode shows a histogram on screen, so you don't have to guess.Some nitpicking: The screen looks great in anything but direct sunlight; working outdoors can be difficult sometimes. While most images are nearly free of noise, noticeable noise appears in some, inexplicably. Sometimes autofocus isn't quite accurate. Given the price, feature set, and extreme portability of the camera, I can live with those little details.", "Date": "May 21, 2012"}, {"Title": "IMPRESSED", "Author": "Sully", "ReviewID": "R6F6S1PPY9ZQ6", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "Update (October 2012):There are a few reviews on this camera from people who did not delve into the complex settings of the device you are looking at. Their reviews unfortunately dragged down the star ratings to an unrealistic rating. This camera is great! Image quality is great! However, I have not used the automatic mode very much. You will get amazing quality pictures when you spend time on your shots. There are simple settings like ISO (light sensitivity), aperture, and shutter speed. Toggling these settings will create awesome pictures worthy of your family album, Facebook profile, and personal website.____________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________I wanted a great camera to capture the beautiful landscapes of my life in the Midwest. However, I did not want a big fat DSLR-style camera or a compact camera with 5x zoom. And why not spring for the attractive white version?Prime shipping is awesome. I received this in less than 24 hours.Like I did, you may be reading critic and user reviews on various models and you'll be dazzled with each different variation on the same technology. This is an ultra-zoom compact camera which combines automated settings with the ability to vary settings manually, just as the pros do! The critics will say this or that about a camera, but they seem to me to always recommend the newest $300 model.This camera has an 18x zoom which can be used for both photos and videos. It has a 3-inch LCD screen and a dedicated video record button.You can actually edit photos during and after taking them, with different effects and scenes that may remind you of Instagram on your smartphone.Speaking of smartphones, THIS CAMERA HAS WIFI! So yeah, you can send photos and videos to Facebook, email, Picasa, Youtube, Photobucket, and Microsoft SkyDrive. Even better, with an Android or iPhone, you can use two apps that will interface with this camera: Mobile Link and Remote Viewfinder.Suppose you're taking a group photo, but you want to be in it! You can zoom, change basic settings, and snap the photo from your PHONE with Remote Viewfinder.Perhaps you want to transfer content from the camera to your phone: Use Mobile Link. In both cases, the Samsung WB150F creates its own wireless access point which pairs with your phone.The above features may work best with Samsung phones, however my HTC Droid Incredible worked perfectly for this! You won't regret your purchase!", "Date": "July 6, 2012"}, {"Title": "Gadgetry Galore!", "Author": "Photog Dude", "ReviewID": "R1XYQAAC3KLI8D", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I based my purchase mainly on the WI-FI, 18x ZOOM, and compatibility of my Samsung Galaxy phone.  First of all flash your camera to the latest firmware (May,2012).  Install the CD on your computer and there's pull-down for firmware upgrade, follow instructions, if you get lost, there's a blurb on YouTube on how to flash your camera.  Connect your camera to a wifi access point then begin uploading to SkyDrive, Picasa, FB.  Post directly to FB.  You'll need to create an account on SkyDrive to upload to the Cloud. I use DropBox I can appreciate saving to the cloud.  Enable your phone to \"hotspot\" then use your phone to connect to the Web.  I'm an avoid DSLR user so I wanted something that can be used traveling rather than carrying a gigantic DSLR.  The HD video is 720p and it's fine for my needs. It's a lot more stable than my JVC 3CCD HD 1080p, video is very stable.  Reviews say the color is most accurate and it's true, very vivid images.  You may want to mess with the general settings of contrast, brightness and color density to get it just right.  I TOTALLY recommend the Samsung WB150!  I'll post more as I begin getting into the guts of this camera.UPDATE: 8/17/2012: It's been 2.5 months and a 10 day vacation in the Caribbean.  Took over 2500 pics.  I still think it's a good camera, but it's not without it's faults.  After a few shots, my WB150 froze up and the only way to fix this to pull the battery. I purchased 2 after-market batteries (non-Samsung) and it seemed to be OK, but I'm suspecting the 3rd party battery might be causing the freezing.  The copying from camera to smartphone had gotten real slow.  I assume it might be due to the amount of data on the 32GB drive.  When you sync up to your smartphone, also Samusung Galaxy S, it's gotten a lot longer wait times for the pictures populate on the phone.  I tried a smaller SD card (16GB) with less stuff and it seemed to fix the slowness issue. Kinda makes sense. More pics it's gotta read, the longer the read times.  Oh, if you have a new SD card, be sure to format the card on the camera, otherwise, it's going to be slow times powering up your WB150.  We did get to upload pics from the WB150 to the smartphone and post to Facebook.  That was one of biggest reasons I got the camera to begin with.  The only way to enable the flash (fill-in) is \"P\" mode. Smart mode will determine if you need flash or not.  Smart wasn't a bad way to go if you're outside.  But in you're in the tour bus, disabling the flash is key. Let the camera figure out the rest. I admit I did not use my old DSLR (Olympus E-1) at all and kept using the WB150.  I like the Red video button. It's not to hit the video button while shooting stills.  There's a dedicated video setting  on the dial as well.  I'll keep you guys posted.", "Date": "June 6, 2012"}, {"Title": "Great Features, not so great camera", "Author": "bweets", "ReviewID": "R115YOGNB8W371", "Overall": "3.0", "Content": "Before I start, I should disclose that I am an owner of a Canon D-SLR so this review might be a little biased.I purchased this camera as a \"carry around\" point and shoot for occasions when dragging a D-SLR is not quite suited. Wanted something with reasonable telephoto and high megapixel (for printing) and was very impressed with the list of features including; wi-fi transfer, upload to MicroSoft Skydrive, Android live-view app (very cool) and some of the other shooting modes. The camera is full of fun features and they all work very well as described, the downside unfortunately is the camera. It takes wonderful pictures in wide-angle, broad daylight but anything beyond that it really struggles with. Night photos are very grainy as are telephoto photos in moderate lighting. The telephoto is understandable as many variables play into zoomed images but the night and indoor shots almost make you want to leave this camera at home and just use your smartphone. The indoor images are very comparable.All in all, it's not a bad camera and the price I paid on Amazon was fantastic. But in the end, I will likely not use it as much as I had originally anticipated. If you are looking for a point-and-shoot as an everyday camera, I would look to spend a little bit more and go for image quality over features first and foremost.", "Date": "September 21, 2012"}, {"Title": "Finally , A Camera To Love !!!", "Author": "Lauren", "ReviewID": "R3PTBKCYTNKZ3", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "Anything I say would be superfluous.

I wasn't looking for something with DSLR IQ nor even a higher end point and shoot IQ.  I also wanted a camera with wifi capabilities so that I could upload photos to facebook without having to transfer the photos via the traditional route.  My choice came down to the Samsung wb150f and Canon PowerShot ELPH 320 HS.  I read the reviews on Amazon and different websites before deciding on the Samsung.The main reason I decided to choose the Samsung over the Canon is that Samsung offers full manual control.  Yes, using manual mode is a bit clunky, especially the manual focus but for me, having some manual mode is better than having none at all. I also read that Samsung was a direct upload whereas with the Canon, I would have to upload the photos to Canon's cloud service to post any of my photos to Facebook.When I purchased the camera, I wasn't really expecting much in terms of IQ since reviews from photo/tech sites were mediocre.  Imagine my pleasant surprise when I received the camera and started doing some test shots!  Yes, it's true that you're not going to win any photo contests from photo magazines but for every day use to capture memories, it is exactly what I was looking for.The IQ is better than expected for the size.  Looking at the photos on my 24in monitor, my ipad with retina display, my macbook pro with retina display, the camera takes great photos.  The colors are vibrant; the images- crisp enough. Low light images were good enough for the size of the camera.  Higher ISO pictures were noisy but I can't imagine any camera in this price range and this size doing any better.I had no problems connecting my camera wirelessly to my Samsung phone, my ipad 3, and my Nexus 7 tablet.  I did not try to connect it to my macbook pro bc that laptop is normally not used for photo storage.  For people having difficulties with connecting the camera to your iphone/ipad, make sure you go into your settings and choose the camera's network under wifi- not your default wifi network.  The viewfinder app also works seamlessly.  Photos uploaded to facebook without a hitch.So what are the cons?  As someone else mentioned in their review, the lcd screen is difficult to see in bright sunlight but the camera is small enough to hold with one hand so I just use my other hand to shield the screen for better view.  Auto-focus seems a tad slower than other point and shoot cameras in manual mode.  I also had to install Samsung's proprietary software on my computer to update the firmware on the camera.All in all, I'm very happy with my purchase, and I would recommend this camera to anyone who is looking for a fun, inexpensive point and shoot.", "Date": "August 16, 2012"}, {"Title": "I wanted to love this camera.....", "Author": "Angela Streiff", "ReviewID": "R2Z9NHCMA2P7JU", "Overall": "3.0", "Content": "I shopped around for so long, trying to find just the perfect camera to replace my old digital one. I literally wore out my last digital camera. It got to the point where the lens covers came off, and the photos that were taken took several minutes to save to the memory card. So it was time for something new. After months of shopping and reading reviews, I took a chance on this Samsung. I have to admit, I was a sucker for the white case color. It's a modern and clean look and case color, and with the features is has, I had to believe it would take at least adequate photos, and it may very well do that, if you know how to change all the light and and shutter settings.Alas, I am not a professional photographer. I know how to turn the flash on and off, I know how to set my cameras for macro photos, and even how to take photos at night. But for the most part, unless my point and shoot digital camera has a setting that tells me this is \"night mode\", \"museum mode\", \"light behind an object mode\", etc, I am not familiar enough with the manual settings to get the best photos for all these situations. Thankfully, there is a settings mode that offers some of these as options, but what it really needs is an \"indoors light photo\" mode, since the smart-auto mode can't seem to capture photos taken indoors well. Like many people, I buy a point and shoot digital camera with auto focus to do just that, take the photo and focus for me. If I knew what was the appropriate shutter speed to take a photo of my kids opening gifts on Christmas morning, I would purchase and use an SLR.With that said, the point and shoot results from this camera vary constantly. Indoor photos are always too dark, and like I've seen mentioned elsewhere by others, there is an odd black shadow in almost every indoor photo taken. I have to take 10 photos of the same thing from slightly different angles before I can get a shot without it. Outdoor images are beautiful. Unfortunately, I find a lot of life's moments that I want to capture in photos, happens indoors.There are some really fun features to this camera that I have learned to love. You can take photos in split-shot. Which means you take one photo, then take a second one, and it creates the two images into one single photo, with one on the left and one on the right. This is great for front and back photos of objects. There is a picture-in-pictures feature, all kinds of neat photo effects and you can take panoramic photos.  There's a whole host of other high tech features, such as being able to transfer photos from your camera to your PC or other devices through wi-fi. However as fun as these are, I find myself grabbing my iPhone to take photos indoors when I need to, just so I can get the photo the first time. It's disappointing that my cell phone takes better shots inside. As appealing as the features and sleek white case are, it's not worth it if more than half of the photos always come out bad. If you're familiar with changing your settings for light and shutter speed and are okay with doing that every time you use this camera, it may work out great for you. But if you need a point and shoot that you can just turn on and take a photo without a lot of thought as to the lighting and settings, this one will likely give you headaches.Update 3/11/2013: Something I didn't mention in my original review is that yes, the wi-fi does work. I found it pretty simple to use, however I'm the network administrator in my office at work, so connecting things across a network is something I do frequently. Samsung has done what they can to make it as simple as possible, but in the end I find it faster to just pull out the memory card and download everything to my computer that way. The wi-fi is handy if you're on vacation or not at home, have access to a wireless connection, and are looking to send images from your camera to FaceBook or an email address. But it's not by any means faster or easier than downloading them to your computer via the memory card. Also, the dark shadows do still show up in my indoor photos. I don't use a camera case or anything like that could cause it. It's just not a great low light camera. However it takes great outdoor images.", "Date": "November 7, 2012"}, {"Title": "Awful Photo Quality - Read Before Buying!", "Author": "C. Antonelli", "ReviewID": "RIXQ2P1QLYH65", "Overall": "1.0", "Content": "My wife wanted a new camera for Christmas as we were falling into the rut of using our iPhones for pictures and sacraficing quality for convenience.  Hesitant to buy another camera when the market is changing so rapidly, I did a search to see what the latest features were on cameras that could make our purchase more future-proof.  Searching for \"wifi camera\" brought up the Samsung line and looking at the modern features they pack in for the price, they seemed like a no-brainer.  My wife loves posting on Facebook, etc and these cameras can do that directly.  Out of the models available, the WB150F seemed the logical choice as we didn't need it to be tiny and wanted something with a better lens than our iPhones were capable of.  The reviews concerned me though with many excellent reviews with the occasional review mentioning terrible picture quality.  Hmmm, maybe those people with problems don't know what they are doing, or so I thought.  So I decided to take a chance and buy it for her.Fast forward to the day she got it.  At first it was nothing but sheer joy as she set up all the features and even posted a quick picture to Facebook from the couch as we opened our presents.  Wifi worked great.  Remote shutter release via the Samsung iPhone app worked great.  She could copy pictures from the camera directly to her iPhone and iPad on iOS 6 no problem.  \"This is the perfect camera!\" she exclaimed.  Dad finally nailed a gift for the wife it appeared.Deep down I knew I still had to see how the pictures looked on the computer before I'd be out of the woods.  Before doing so, I decided to spend 2 hours, yes 2 hours on Christmas, reading the owners manual and fully understanding the settings.  I also loaded the software and updated the firmware on the camera to latest as of 12/25/2012 which is very easy to do.  Once I did all that I went on a photo taking mission taking shots of everything from closeups, to portraits of my kids, to going outside and shooting anything and everything.  About 100 shots.  Time for the moment of truth - I transferred all the pictures to the computer and went through them all a couple times.  The results??  I would classify 80% of the pictures as straight up unacceptable for any camera.  Absolutely dismal quality.  Seriously, I give my iPhone 4S little credit for taking great pictures but it sadly does a better job with most.  Absolutely pathetic.  Out of all the shots, the ONLY ones that were really fine were closeup shots at 2 feet or less.  The camera lens appears to do a nice job handling those.  Anything beyond that however and get ready for blurry slightly out of focus shots.  The funny thing is I don't think it's the camera doing a poor job of choosing the focus, but rather the lens is just very poor overall.  But that's just a guess.  Shot after shot, there is just a slight blur in any kind of detail.  Enough so that you would get a headache if you had to look at a lot of them.So we ended up returning it as fast as we could and bought a non-wifi model which takes beautiful pictures.  Every great feature in the world is worthless on a camera that takes poor photos.  I can already do all of the features this has with my iPhone, we just wanted something that took actual photo quality photos with a decent flash.  This isn't it.  That said, the Samsung DV300 reviews appear to be more consistent.  It's smaller but maybe it just has a better designed lens.  Samsung is on the right track with the features people would like in a camera, unfortunately this model in particular does not do the most important thing - take good pictures!", "Date": "December 28, 2012"}, {"Title": "Full size SD card vs Micro SD card", "Author": "R.

The Wifi feature is what sold me on the camera...now after saying that I will say that it has been failing just as much as it has been working...I constantly try uploading pics to Facebook direct from the camera and and I continually get a upload failed error after only one or two pics, so I have to get online to see which ones were uploaded or I end up uploading several duplicates (kind of defeats the purpose if I have to check as I'm not saving time)...the 1st couple of times I tried it worked fine...recently it hasn't been working as well.  Another awesome feature is the Remote View Finder...It does work with my HTC Sensation and I would think it would work with any newer Android phone.  Some people say they can't get it set up or it's hard but it's really not that hard.  You activate the cameras Wifi function, then connect your phone to the WB150F \"hotspot,\" then select the app and from there you can control the veiwfinder (zoom, timer, and shutter) or transfer pics. Also it does have a completely manual function, which I haven't used yet, but you don't see that much on a camera at this price.  Also I do like the editing feature built into the camera and also the features on the Samsung software....you can do things like create GIFs, which is pretty cool.  Now saying all those good things I will say that the auto focus takes quite a bit of time to work and there is some lag.  The burst shots are cool but are taken @ 3MP...a lot of the cooler functions downgrade the pic quality to anywhere from 3-10 MPs.  I've seen better pics from a sub $200.00 camera but this one is alright...I do think picture quality in low light is below avg and grainy but outside it's fantastic.

I really liked everything this camera had to offer as far as picture effects but the first day I used it it started to freeze on me. I had known this was an issue with this camera because I saw it  as in issue on other reviews. It only happened a couple times over the next few weeks so I ignored it because I didn't want to deal with the hassle of returning it and waiting for it to be fixed or replaced etc. Well, I took it to Thailand over Christmas and it would not stop freezing. The worst part is when it freezes, you have to take the battery out to get it to react and whatever picture you just took before it froze is never saved. As you can imagine, when you are on a once in a lifetime trip to a country you will never go to again, losing every other minute to wait for your camera to be functioning again can mean you miss the photo opportunity. Photo quality is not as good as my previous camera though it has the same zoom, mega pixels etc. There also seems to be something wrong with the zoom and when i turn it on sometimes it says I need to turn it off and take out the battery and turn it on again/or contact the retailer.

It is of plasticky construction, but solid and the build quality seems good.  The white body looks nice enough.  No printed manual, but the manual (PDF) is on the CD and is quite detailed.  You can read on your PC. Tablet, or other device or print it out if you like.The big question for many seems to be the WiFi.  I have a pretty standard wifi setup and I had no problems at all.  I selected my network, chose the shared setting, entered the password (easy) and it connected right away.  No need to even read the manual, just turn the dial to WiFi and you can probably figure it out if you have set up many devices before.  Once this was done, I was able to easily upload images to my SkyDrive after entering my login info, again easy to do.  I was also able to email photos to my email account.  Transfers were quick (normal wifi transfer speeds) for the 4-6 images I tested with.  If you try to transfer 500 images it's going to take awhile, probably better to just remove the SD card and use your SD card reader (or plug the camera up via USB).  But for casual transfers of images it works fine.  So the Wifi was easy to setup and use in my opinion and works well.  USB->PC transfers were also easy and fast.  And, of course, you can pop out the SD card and use your PC card reader or external USB reader as well.Update: Also tested PC Autobackup via wifi which transfers all pictures from your camera to your PC.  This is the most efficient wifi mode and also preserves the image size and quality.  Many of the other modes (like SkyDrive, social media choices, compress the file size).  You have to install the software on your PC from the CD (which also contains the manual and Intelli-Studio software) and pair once via USB.  After that you can use the PC Autobackup option from the WiFi menu on the camera and everything works automatically and efficiently. You can also transfer pictures selectively while browsing via the playback menu.  In general, all of the wifi options I have tried have worked well.  There was one instance where a transfer \"stalled\" but when restarted it completed fine and there were no further issues.Update: In further use AutoBackup has worked fast and without any problems.  It is definitely the best mode for saving your images off the camera via Wifi.  You always have the option of using the USB connection or removing the card, but AutoBackup works well enough that I don't see any need for that unless some circumstances preclude it. This mode tracks what you have transferred and will only transfer new images/videos - nice!  Transfers are placed in a dated folder, also nice.The camera handles well.  The Menus and controls are OK and easy to use.  Full manual settings are available which is nice at this price point. SMART mode seems to work OK. Everything works pretty much like you'd expect.  Zoom toggle is a bit small, but it worked OK.PQ Update: Images look soft and a bit low contrast.  Picture quality seems about average for a P&S; travel zoom camera.  Colors are good, saturation on the lower end compared to many.  The biggest issue seems to be the aggressive noise reduction (due to the small sensor size) which smears details and causes a loss of sharpness. Contrast also seems low.  The end result is the pictures do not have the \"zing\" that most out of camera jpegs have these days, so many will be disappointed in the image quality, I think.  It is possible to add some color saturation, sharpness and contrast, but the loss of detail due to the small, budget sensor cannot be \"fixed.\" That said, apparent image quality when viewing at normal screen and print sizes is OK and this may not be a big issue for some people.  This is not a DSLR.  At this price, the quality is acceptable, and images can be tweaked in any decent editor (though the lost detail cannot be recovered). For casual use, I think it is OK.  I've seen other cameras in this price range with very similar issues.  The noise reduction smearing of small detail is the biggest negative, so if you like crisp details, this will not be a good choice for you.So, picture quality is acceptable, but not stellar.  With a bit of care, good images are possible and the wifi and other features are unique at this price level. Decide if you can live with that in exchange for the other fun features offered.  In casual use, most people are not going to notice a lot of this.  Enthusiasts will.The many various modes, scenes, and effects are all a fun plus.  The \"live panorama\" mode worked very well in my few tests so far.  I was quite impressed, actually.  I found the camera fun to use.  There is built in help that explains most of the choices on screen and the controls are well thought out (for the most part) and easy to figure out and use.So far, it looks like a decent deal at the current price.  Comes with battery, charger, USB cable, CD, and wrist strap, but no SD card.2013-02-16 Update: Video -  Surprise!  The relative quality of the videos are pretty good.  The 30fps 720p HD (1260x720) video tests I took looked pretty good.  Good color, saturation, contrast, and detail (for video) and all in all very acceptable.  The videos also transferred fine via AutoBackup over wifi, thought they take longer due to much larger file sizes.  Having an 18x optical zoom that works in video mode is a nice plus, too, and it works pretty well.

I have attained crystal clear images of the moon, while also manipulating the controls to achieve bright, clear pictures in a dim room. The entire reason I bought the camera was because I could not afford a DSLR and it offered the best manual and program options.For instance, I have been able to create \"light art\"; I have captured the detail on the veins of leaves and the hairs on spiders legs; I have altered the settings so that the moon's light appeared to illuminate the entire background.

Yes, it can do that, provided that the user knows his cameras.If you are new to cameras, have never worked with film cameras, or are not familiar with program and manual controls, then it is best to skip over this camera, unless you are wanting to learn those functions, which I highly recommend.Additional features include pan shots, which can get a little sticky. Occasionally, there was a glitch if I allowed the SD card to near maximum storage, but I was really pushing it to the limit. I thought the frame features were cute, but ultimately rarely used them. The internal photo editor is not terribly advanced, but again may be manipulated to achieve some stunning results.Some other cons include: constant use of the zoom will lead to rapid wear -- I know, I am a nut with the zoom. The sound and video quality were not exceptional, however I have seen far worse. I had the opportunity to video a lightning storm with it and the still images from the video were not incredibly sharp, but were definitely decent.The macro is function is my biggest rave.

Beware it only works with Windows.  b)Social sharing, I have no problem uploading photos to the Facebook account, however for the video clips, only those with resolution lower than 320x240 and less that 30 seconds can be uploaded, which practically makes this feature useless.  c)I can only upload photos/videos to Facebook/YouTube/SkyDrive. For some reason I couldn't make Picasa and Photobucket work. The same story happened to Email.5. Remote Viewfinder allows me to use my smart phone as a remote controller, as well as view finder. It's kinda fun, could be handy for self picture taking. However the feature set is very limited, and the picture resolution is rather low.6. Text inputting is miserable! After scrolling through all those alphabetic/symbols/numbers, my fingers are crying. I also notice it doesn't remember inputting history, which is quite a bummer.Overall a fun toy, it leaves a lot of room for improvement for sure.", "Date": "May 1, 2013"}, {"Title": "Perfect!", "Author": "Dancecrazd88", "ReviewID": "R3L64JU1K0KISB", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "Pros:Wireless settings.

It has functioned almost flawlessly and people consistently comment on how good my photos look (it's not my photo skills, it's the camera).Plusses:>Great \"smart\" mode (i.e., 'auto').  Goes from far-away to macro to flash to no-flash all without any assistance from me - and does it while taking great photos.>Fast start-up.  I'm used to turning on my previous cameras and having to wait.  This camera starts up almost instantly and is ready to shoot.>Fast cycle time.  Some previous cameras have had nearly ridiculous photo-to-photo wait times.  I can snap pretty rapid-fire with this one.>Has a feature for \"text\".  I use this to take photos of documents.  Often I scribble notes to myself on documents with pencil.  I have tried scanning such documents to pdf, but the pencil marks rarely come through.  Using the camera to shoot the document preserves all my scribbles, and I can throw the paper away.>Handles abuse well.  I've treated this and all my other cameras pretty roughly and taken them in really bad environments.  This camera is holding up very well.>Good button placement.  Having used several different cameras, I've found that not all cameras are created equal on this issue.  This camera is comfortable to hold and shoot, and the buttons are placed so you don't tend to push them accidentally.Minuses:>There is one small area within the zoom range where the camera seems to have trouble focusing.  That is kind of annoying.>Turning the date stamp on and off is somewhat more involved than on some of my past cameras.>Self-timer.  In \"smart\" mode, you only have two choices - \"off\" or \"10 seconds\".  You have to go into \"program\" mode in order to get a third option (2 seconds).  Not a huge deal, but other cameras have had a little more flexibility here.Something that I thought would be a minus, but is not:The battery.  Most of my old cameras used AA batteries.  I hated to turn to a camera that has a special battery.  Three things have 'solved' this initial reluctance 1) I bought an extra battery at Batteries Plus, and I keep it in the camera pouch, charged and ready to go.  This added about $25, but is worth it because now I don't fear dead battery.  2) The battery lasts for hundreds of shots - far longer than I expected it to last.  I have rarely needed to switch batteries.  3) I can recharge in the car with my 100-watt cigarette-lighter-AC-power-inverter device [if you don't already have one, get one!].I think I have used only about 10% of the camera's functions so far.  I probably will never use the WiFi or many of the 'program' options, but it's nice to know they're there just in case.My tips:Tip #1: Windows Live Photo GalleryThis is a great free program that can 'rescue' even a lousy raw digital photo.  If you haven't tried it, download it and play with it.  Try the \"Edit>Fine Tune\" feature.Tip #2: IrfanviewI usually take photos at the 10MP setting.  This gives me a jpg file size of about 4 to 5 MB each.  I can knock that down to about 200 to 300 KB using \"quality level 20\" on Irfanview and the pictures still look really good.  Plenty good enough to paste into a Word document or an email.  You can download Irfanview for free.  I have used it for several years.  Great program.I have found that it is far better to take the photos on a high MP setting and reduce them down later if I don't need the high level of detail in the final jpg file, than to take photos on a lower setting and then wish that they had more detail.  The camera came with an 8GB SD card, and I have never even come close to filling it up.", "Date": "February 13, 2013"}, {"Title": "Nice Camera - no problems (yet)", "Author": "Alec Carlson \"Mohawk\"", "ReviewID": "RW0NGCC4JDF8N", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I just bought this camera two days ago. I was replacing a Canon Elph which had never worked right since the day I bought it. 90% of the Elph pictures were always out of focus. I looked around at the reviews for a number of non-Canon cameras and the Samsung WB150F was the camera I ended up with. I bought it for 4 reasons: (1) because if had a larger body and controls then most other point and shoot cameras. (2) It had built-in WiFi and I could beam pictures directly to my Samsung 55\" LED TV. (3) It got decent reviews from other owners (4) it was not a Canon.I decided to test it out by taking an inventory of all of my stuff in my house. This was something I had wanted to do for some time. I took 160 pictures in different lighting conditions. I did not use \"Smart Mode\"; Instead I put it into \"Programmed Mode\". All of the pictures except 1 looked great and most importantly, they were all in focus. One of the pictures was on the under-exposed side. I then tried the WiFi link to my TV. It took me a couple of attempts to enter my router WEP password correctly but I eventually got the case and spelling correct... :-) The TV discovered my camera and I was able to select the camera as the TV input device. Once that was done,I could browse the pictures on the camera using the TV remote control and display them on the big screen. That was pretty cool. I then decided to download the pictures from the camera to my MacBook Air. This was pretty simple - just plug the USB cable into the camera and the Mac, power the camera on, wait for the camera's flash disk drive to get mounted and then just drag the folder off of the camera's drive and onto the Mac's HD. I copied 400MB of pictures in a couple of minutes. Some reviewers complained that you couldn't use WiFi to copy the pics to your Mac but \"why would you want to ?\". The USB connection is faster and a lot less hassle then beaming the pictures over.So far, I have no complaints with this camera. It has worked perfectly and the pictures are great - at least for me.

And it reaches to 18x zoom quickly with little noise.  Though like most compact digital cameras, the 18x zoom is exaggerated.  It's more like 6x to me.  It has a wide angle lens so it's great for taking group photos.  I didn't have to read the manual to figure out how to use this camera.  It's quite intuitive, the way technology should be.The picture/video quality is not as good compared to my other cameras, which is fine in this low price range.  The colors seem washed out a bit compared to my iPhone 5's and Sony Cybershot's.  Its anti-shake feature seems to work well.Samsung puts the flash at a location where my finger can block it partially, so need to be careful when taking flash photos.  It does not come with a separate battery charger.  We can spend all day taking over 200 photos and a few videos, yet it still have a bit of battery life left.Overall this camera is easy to use, easy to hold and priced right.  If you want a long zoom compact camera at a low price, this is a great buy.  Those who want high quality photos should look elsewhere.Update 4/23/2013 - The SkyDrive upload works now, which allows backing up photos while traveling (without lugging along a laptop.)  Apparently SkyDrive has decided to increase the file size limit.  It does not allow bulk upload.

The camera doesn't feel as rigid as my Canon's so I hope it doesn't break when I drop it.  Also, they put a sticker on the LCD that wouldn't peel right off and I had to use a bunch of cleaner to get all the gum off.  Not as fast as the Canon's when scrolling through the pictures.

If you try to transfer 500 images it's going to take awhile, probably better to just remove the SD card and use your SD card reader (or plug the camera up via USB).  But for casual transfers of images it works fine.  So the Wifi was easy to setup and use in my opinion and works well.  USB->PC transfers were also easy and fast.  And, of course, you can pop out the SD card and use your PC card reader or external USB reader as well.Update: Also tested PC Autobackup via wifi which transfers all pictures from your camera to your PC.  This is the most efficient wifi mode and also preserves the image size and quality.  Many of the other modes (like SkyDrive, social media choices, compress the file size).  You have to install the software on your PC from the CD (which also contains the manual and Intelli-Studio software) and pair once via USB.  After that you can use the PC Autobackup option from the WiFi menu on the camera and everything works automatically and efficiently. You can also transfer pictures selectively while browsing via the playback menu.  In general, all of the wifi options I have tried have worked well.  There was one instance where a transfer \"stalled\" but when restarted it completed fine and there were no further issues.Update: In further use AutoBackup has worked fast and without any problems.  It is definitely the best mode for saving your images off the camera via Wifi.  You always have the option of using the USB connection or removing the card, but AutoBackup works well enough that I don't see any need for that unless some circumstances preclude it. This mode tracks what you have transferred and will only transfer new images/videos - nice!  Transfers are placed in a dated folder, also nice.The camera handles well.  The Menus and controls are OK and easy to use.  Full manual settings are available which is nice at this price point. SMART mode seems to work OK. Everything works pretty much like you'd expect.  Zoom toggle is a bit small, but it worked OK.PQ Update: Images look soft and a bit low contrast.  Picture quality seems about average for a P&S; travel zoom camera.  Colors are good, saturation on the lower end compared to many.  The biggest issue seems to be the aggressive noise reduction (due to the small sensor size) which smears details and causes a loss of sharpness. Contrast also seems low.  The end result is the pictures do not have the \"zing\" that most out of camera jpegs have these days, so many will be disappointed in the image quality, I think.  It is possible to add some color saturation, sharpness and contrast, but the loss of detail due to the small, budget sensor cannot be \"fixed.\" That said, apparent image quality when viewing at normal screen and print sizes is OK and this may not be a big issue for some people.  This is not a DSLR.  At this price, the quality is acceptable, and images can be tweaked in any decent editor (though the lost detail cannot be recovered). For casual use, I think it is OK.  I've seen other cameras in this price range with very similar issues.  The noise reduction smearing of small detail is the biggest negative, so if you like crisp details, this will not be a good choice for you.So, picture quality is acceptable, but not stellar.  With a bit of care, good images are possible and the wifi and other features are unique at this price level. Decide if you can live with that in exchange for the other fun features offered.  In casual use, most people are not going to notice a lot of this.  Enthusiasts will.The many various modes, scenes, and effects are all a fun plus.  The \"live panorama\" mode worked very well in my few tests so far.  I was quite impressed, actually.  I found the camera fun to use.  There is built in help that explains most of the choices on screen and the controls are well thought out (for the most part) and easy to figure out and use.So far, it looks like a decent deal at the current price.  Comes with battery, charger, USB cable, CD, and wrist strap, but no SD card.2013-02-16 Update: Video -  Surprise!  The relative quality of the videos are pretty good.  The 30fps 720p HD (1260x720) video tests I took looked pretty good.  Good color, saturation, contrast, and detail (for video) and all in all very acceptable.  The videos also transferred fine via AutoBackup over wifi, thought they take longer due to much larger file sizes.  Having an 18x optical zoom that works in video mode is a nice plus, too, and it works pretty well.  The video is as good or better than a lot of the small portable video cams I have used and they're in the mp4 format so almost all devices should be able to handle them well.  Sound is mono (as usual for low price cam video) but decent. So we have a bit of a \"sleeper\" here if you like to shoot video as well as stills.", "Date": "February 23, 2013"}, {"Title": "images qualitiy is very poor", "Author": "Temur", "ReviewID": "RT81MHRJHBILH", "Overall": "2.0", "Content": "I bought it two month ago, i thought it's, and wi-fi.allshare, and I love samsung products, But picture quality was as in 5mp camera!

I have a DSLR. I shoot mainly with my samsung smartphone. I've photographed a wedding and (officially) at pro sports events for a client. I've been taking pictures all of my life.  This is just meant to say- I have somewhat of a clue what I'm doing.Why I bought this: I didn't want to take my expensive and bulky DSLR setup out of the country of vacation. It's not the best of locations and the activities I was participating in couldn't accommodate the equipment. I needed a small point and shoot with decent zoom. I also considered it a huge bonus that it had wifi so I could share photos while on vacation from my hotel. It was a bonus that this, and my phone, are the same manufacturer and I could use Samsungs various apps to interface back and forth- either as a remote viewfinder and to transfer pictures back and forth.The Verdict: The wifi features are great. I connected, more often, between my phone and camera than directly from the camera to wifi. Many hotels require you to do a web-based logon when accessing their wifi. This is impossible for the camera to do.There's some scene modes that most cameras have. I mainly used the panoramic function which worked amazingly.Picture quality was variable. I believe the autofocus was lacking, especially in low light and in motion.  There is a surprisingly short depth of field if the camera is in anything but landscape mode, it seemed. And with the sketchy autofocus, I lost a more than a few shots where the wrong item was focused on.Let's talk about the zoom. This has a pretty extensive one for a camera of its size, afterall.  Well, that's why this product gets 2 stars instead of 4. After only a few days of shooting, the zoom broke. I was about to take a photo, so I extended the zoom, and then... the camera wouldn't take a picture. It wouldn't focus at all (something that happened a few times before). Like the other times, I pressed the power button to reset the camera. But this time, the lens didn't retract. On powering it up, a message said the zoom function had an error and to remove the battery and try again. I did that multiple times with no better result. The same message and only that message. Bricked.Luckily my photos were safe on the card. I used my phone's camera the rest of the trip. And Amazon refunded my purchase without issue. I wouldn't recommend this camera to anyone unless you specifically needed the specific wifi features that it has.", "Date": "June 3, 2014"}, {"Title": "Great", "Author": "Andrew", "ReviewID": "R2UC1SA6UPAHGF", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "Samsung WB150F Long Zoom Smart Camera - Black (ECWB150FBPBUS)< this camera is not what I really intended to order. but so far it is working great.", "Date": "June 2, 2014"}, {"Title": "Not happy", "Author": "Lor \"lo-lo\"", "ReviewID": "R20K4F5CS3ZSDA", "Overall": "2.0", "Content": "Doesn't take great pictures inside at all.

Wifi will not work for you...", "Author": "H. Kirk", "ReviewID": "R1SFXOKD9GVFTP", "Overall": "2.0", "Content": "MAC USERS BEWARE!!!  Although Samsung's website description for this camera gives you system requirements for a Mac, their software does not work on Macs (which they don't tell you anywhere).  So you cannot use the wifi uploading feature to wirelessly upload your photos to your computer.  Trying to even get the camera connected to any wifi is a task in itself.  I did finally get a photo to email off of the camera, but it emails the photos through a Samsung email network, so it went into my Spam folder when I received it on my computer.  This makes sending photos to others difficult since it goes into their Spam folders.Also, Samsung's Remote Viewfinder App that they have for the iPhone does not work at all.  Even after it updated the App 4 or 5 times in only 4 weeks time, it never worked. I called and spent more than an hour on the phone with their techie who swore up and down that Samsung does not mention system requirements for Mac on their website and that they absolutely do not make an app for the iPhone and never would.  When I proved her wrong by having her go to their own website and by having her open iTunes and see the App that says it is made by Samsung and says that it is supposed to work for this camera model, she said that she couldn't help me because although they have apps for other phones, they only guarantee their Samsung-based phone app to work.I admit that I got pretty decent quality pictures from the camera (although not in low light).  The 18x zoom is also great on such a compact camera.  So I gave it a 2 star rating instead of 1.  But if you are a Mac / iPhone user and are purchasing the phone for the wifi capabilities, forget it.I will say that no matter why you are purchasing it, EVEN IF YOU ARE A PC USER, expect that if you have a problem with or question about the camera, you will likely know more than their techies do (no offense, but they were clueless about what Samsung even offered or stated... let alone about being able to give any actual help or answers).

I put in my SkyDrive account details and connected to my home Wi-Fi, but when I hit submit on the SkyDrive account details i got the message \"error: document to large\". I tried a few times, no change. So went to Samsung's site and found there was a firmware update for it. I followed the instructions and 10mins later I had a bricked, unusable camera.To Samsung's credit they sent through a return box pretty quickly and got the camera back to me in about 7 working days (sadly I think it was a refurb, so probably older than the new one i had bought). I tried all of the above again, still couldn't log in to SkyDrive, so crossed my fingers and did the firmware update. This time it worked and so tried SkyDrive yet again! Still the same error message.So to conclude, although the camera takes good photos and the zoom, although slow, is very good. The extra features that persuaded me to buy this over other cameras of a similar price just do not work as advertised.

That camera took very consistently high-quality pictures and was otherwise very consistent. Unfortunately, it was stolen... The camera after that for me was extremely cheap (I think I paid about $80 for it), and was lost. That one had OK performance at low light, but was completely worthless in nighttime conditions.After that one disappeared, I was in a situation where I was in a developing country that didn't have many options, and the options were all significantly overpriced and not well-reviewed. I'd seen some reviews on this camera that were a little bit troubling, but the vast majority were so incredibly positive that, given a lack of other decent options, I'd give this one a shot.It worked OK at first, but the pictures NEVER were really that clear. Seriously, if I go through a series of these pictures in full screen mode on a laptop screen, not even zoomed in, it will give me a headache if I do so for longer than five minutes. I'm not even talking about full resolution here, just fitting it in the screen. The panorama mode (one thing that was consistently awesome on my previous Samsung) is just flat-out awful - take the fuzziness and multiply it by about 50.I've seen other reviews on here suggesting to use some software to touch up the blurriness of the photos - if you have to do that, it's a terrible camera.Now, I'm a very patient person and don't want to throw away a ton of money (I can't take it back to the store because too much time passed before I realized that it was the camera, and not me, that's the problem), so I have tolerated it for a while. But now is where it crosses the line.... it CONSTANTLY freezes. I looked up on the support website, figuring there'd be some kind of firmware update or something addressing this problem. Nope. Samsung says it's a memory card problem, or that it's defective. The same memory card I've used on this works flawlessly in every single other device I own that has a card slot. And there seem to be a ton of other people out there with the freezing problem, so if mine's defective, it looks like a rather huge proportion of the rest of these are defective. I've found a way to MacGyver its controls to make it work (which takes about two minutes every time I start it up, and therefore is unsustainable for long-term use), but this thing is so awful that the only reason I didn't just smash it on the sidewalk in Quito is because littering is bad.In sum: This thing is garbage; do yourself a favor and get something else.", "Date": "July 3, 2013"}, {"Title": "Good Camera", "Author": "SnC", "ReviewID": "R2V0PQRIKSAVYP", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "Nice camera.

Set to 'Mixed' and auto for bottom three. I had mine set for 20mhz narrow band, Auto sets it what thedevice need, like 40mhz broadband.  It gives you a more stablewifi path for things to talk to each other on. If you send a picture to your Samsung tv, it will get there if you goto Allshare Play photos and look for camera, but the cameracontinues to send, it won't stop sending! On the earlier version Sh100, it works flawlessly.  You take a picture,select it, go to Allshare, select tv UN55ES8000 and the picture comesup on the screen, the whole screen.  You don't even have to screwaround, going to Allshae!  It's there, front and center.

One, the Samsung Viewfinder app does not work from the WB150F to my iPhone, at all, period. The Samsung MobileLink app worked a whopping total of one time. So disappointed. Also, you cannot upload to your Mac without a wire. In essence, unless I want to slowly upload a picture to facebook, the wi-fi feature is absolutely useless. Thanks Samsung!

I don't want people to listen to those reviews about this camera being good and I don't want people to fall for them and waste their money. Ignore them reviews because they're false and incorrect. It is not a good camera and takes the worst pictures ever. I unfortunately fell for buying this camera looking to upgrade from my 6 megapixel, thinking I could take SLR type pictures, well I was wrong. The image quality is so mediocre and not very good at all. Don't think the WIFI is any good either. Just a rubbish camera. DO NOT FALL FOR THE FAKE REVIEWS.

(Source: [...]). So, as usual I decided to get a feel of it at nearby stores. I went to about three stores that had the camera on sale for 159 dollars. I asked the sales rep to turn the camera on for me so I could try it out. All three stores had the camera on display and were broken to the point that it just wouldn't start up at all. Is that a coincidence or is that a pattern that shows how unreliable these cameras are. I would not buy it! I would not recommend it to others! If you like the camera Don't let my review stop you from buying it.  didn't like it and couldn't trust it enough to buy it.
