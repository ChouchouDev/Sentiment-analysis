This is common with all point and shoots... If you shot pictures like machine gun, a few of the pictures will come out blurry)- As someone who has had point and shoot from Sony,Fuji Olympus and Samsung. I can say with confidence that this camera  produces the best amount of detail that I have seen from a recent  small sensor point and shoot. The only two cameras that produce cleaner detail in portrait pictures are probably the Nokia Pureview and my very old Samsung i85 (in Macro mode) neither  of which are Tough or waterproof. For those of you who shot with DSLRs and use RAW format. JPEG images coming out of this camera can be quiet nicely enhanced and sharpened with Photoshop using inverse Gausian blur and a High pass filter as Nikon has been very smart not to over process their images. The same could not be said about the Olympus TG820 and Fuji xp50 that I tried and returned.- Tons of generic battery available for real cheap.- Easy to navigate and intuitive commands and buttons.Cons-The video quality is about equal to the rest of the competition but not as good as the latest Sony point and shoots.- Having a RAW format option would have been nice- Like all newer point and shoots this camera has too many Mega pixels for its sensor size. If Nikon would have keep it at around 8 or 9 MP, picture quality would have been even better.In conclusionIf you are in the market for a rugged design, this camera is a solid contender.Update 03-26-2013I am really pleased with this camera's overall performance. Its a keeper and I am upgrading my rating to a 5 star", "Date": "February 28, 2013"}, {"Title": "Overall a GREAT camera with just a couple minor misses.", "Author": "B. Boyd \"Idaho Photographer\"", "ReviewID": "R2Z3U0BUFJXBWW", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "A little background, I am a professional photographer and have been taking photos for the past 30+ years. I typically shoot only with Nikon camera's and lenses, but for this purchase I did look at other brands.Let's start with what makes this a GREAT camera:* Excellent build quality - the look, feel, weight and attention to build details (seams, fit/finish, quality of components) is Excellent* The wide availability of shooting modes (underwater, close-up, portrait, night +16 other modes) will satisfy even the picky pro user, but the \"Easy Auto Mode\" is awesome for the average user that just wants to pick up the camera and take a picture.*  The built in Wi-Fi and GPS features were easy to use and setup.* IMHO, one of the first truly rugged point & shoots on the market. Freezeproof, Waterproof & Shockproof. Of course with limitations, but still a VERY rugged camera that can take some abuse.* I've taken about 100 pictures so far and am seriously impressed with the quality of the pix and how well the camera does in low-light situations.* Nikon has a Wireless Mobile Adapter Utility app that is pretty cool. I've used it to automatically upload pix right to my iPad. Clean, easy and flawless.With the GREAT also comes some shortfalls. Not a whole lot IMHO, but enough to ding it ONE star* You have to print out your own manual. Sure, a quick start guide is included, but this is a serious feature rich camera and as such, there should be a printed manual to help you gain familiarity and skills. My concern is that the average user is not going to print out the huge PDF manual to learn about the awesome feature set. Which means the camera doesn't get used to nearly it's broad capabilities.* While the 3\" OLED display is beautiful, it is a scratch magnet. Nikon should include a screen protector at this $350 price point.* No included memory card, another shortfall at this price point IMHO. The camera does have 21MB of internal memory so you can shoot right out of the box, but even an 8GB card would have been a big plus.Overall, I really love this camera. A great set of features and usability. The price point is a bit steep, but if you are the type of user that is very hard on your camera or you like to dig into the different features and modes and actually use them, then this is a perfect camera for you. I have a dedicated video camera, so I have not used that feature more than twice. But the times I did, it was easy to use and the HD quality was impressive.A close to 5 STAR camera, but for the price point I felt that Nikon could have included a few extras. But you cannot go wrong with the build quality or the picture quality - those features are truly 5 STAR.", "Date": "March 15, 2013"}, {"Title": "Great Product, just don't push it to the limits...", "Author": "Patrick T", "ReviewID": "RE6NKKAQ1ZE5B", "Overall": "3.0", "Content": "I bought the AW110 as i needed a cam that can take a beating and it particularly waterproof for shallow diving.Since the AW110 in terms of specs can supposedly be submersed to the greatest depth without a underwater housing among all current and upcoming products that I know of, it seemed like a good starting point.I think the other reviews give already a good overview, so I try not to repeat those and only focus on my experience.Good:- Magnetic compass worked really well under water- I found the depth gauge also to be a quite useful feature even readings were always 1-1.5m higher than dive computer.- Underwater pictures look decent- I did not experience any fogging issues as described in the other reviews despite a lot of diving. Maybe because I was very careful with respect to opening it in a dry environment.Bad:- There is an airspace between the plastic screen cover and the actual screen. When you swim deeper than 10m the screen bends in and touches the LCD in the middle and it looks worse when getting anywhere close to 18m. I thought that didn't look healthy for the screen, which brings me to...Ugly:- Screen died on me after three days of diving (and I am 100% sure I stayed within the limits and did not let any water leak into the cam). The camera still took pictures after that but without seeing any controls/viewfinder the cam was a lot less useful.Summary:Looks like a great cam. just don't plan on taking it for diving (I'd say anything close to 10m). I returned it, and will be checking out some of the other upcoming offerings hopefully those keep up better.", "Date": "April 27, 2013"}, {"Title": "Not Waterproof and Nikon wont repair or replace", "Author": "Jo Webber \"Galileo\"", "ReviewID": "RFZUIGS3A7TYO", "Overall": "1.0", "Content": "Here is the straight scoop. I read a ton of reviews of this camera, the Canon, Pentax, Olympus waterproof cameras. The problem is the reviews dont really use the camera underwater. We went to Bora Bora (trip of a lifetime) with our 4 and 7 year old and the camera worked great on the beach - but as soon as we went in the water it leaked water. My kids are young - we were snorkeling - so about 6-12 inches from the surface. I also bought Nikons floaty leash (worked great) so the camera was never more that 12 - 18 inches deep and it leaked. When it dried out it came back to life and does work - but anytime it is- immersed it leaks. Ive had a few Nikon cameras over the years and not had any problems. So I returned it to Nikon when we got back. I have just logged on to the Nikon service center to see the status - and heres what I see :Problem: LIQUID DAMAGE CLEAN & CHECKTotal cost of repair: $137.50*So - as much as I like the form factor of the camera and the photos are decent (when not waterlogged), Im not going to be taking Nikon's repair center up on their offer. Im in the market for a really waterproof waterproof camera. With two kids under ten - I dont need much - just a few feet of water - swimming pools and ocean.So Im afraid the other reviews you see on Amazon about this camera not being waterproof are true and while DP camera and others do great reviews - the reviews here are from people who actually have used the camera underwater.I run a company. Im not sure how Nikon feels about selling a product that claims to be waterproof and then attempts to charge you for 'fixing it' when it leaked in 1 foot of water.", "Date": "October 5, 2013"}, {"Title": "Black Screen of Death is Imminent", "Author": "Matthew T DiMasi", "ReviewID": "R1A0PDHUK9O8K", "Overall": "1.0", "Content": "I am currently on my second AW110.  I purchased the AW110 2 days prior to going on vacation to Bermuda.  I was expecting to take great photos while snorkeling with this camera.  The camera is rated for underwater use at a depth of 59', and not to exceed 1 hour.  I snorkeled for 30 minutes, and did not reach a depth greater than 10' (which is a generous over-estimate).  Upon coming out of the water, the camera would turn on, but the screen would not illuminate.  The screen remained black and is no longer functional.  While the camera has many nice features like integrated Wi-Fi, GPS, and the ability to take 3D pictures, the camera just didn't hold up to even 1/6th of the promised depth.  I contacted Nikon Customer Support/Service which was a complete and utter joke.  The representative that I spoke with claimed to be both customer service and technical support; she was neither technically proficient nor friendly.  I was told to send my camera into Nikon at my own expense for it to be evaluated and Nikon would repair it if possible.  If the camera was not repairable, they would \"possibly\" replace it.  I am extremely thankful that I purchased the AW110 from Amazon.com as they just replaced the entire Camera with minimal questions asked, prepaid return shipping, and the postal carrier picked up the package at my front door.  Lastly, I read many reviews before purchasing this camera and this has happened to MANY MANY individuals.  A basic search on the Internet as well as Amazon.com will show an overwhelming community of consumers that have been viciously bitten by this product.  When I mentioned this to the Technical Support Representative, she exclaimed that she had never heard of this issue before... I'll leave the readers of this review to generate their own opinion on that note.  If I didn't already have a Nikon DSLR prior to purchasing this AW110, I'd be sure to shop with the 5 - Letter competitor that starts with C and ends with anon.  Furthermore, I urge any representative of Nikon with any level of pride in their organization that may be reading this review to contact me.Update #1: Nikon rejected this very same review on their website for \"One or more reasons\" which are unnamed.

My oldest nikon still works perfectly. I have a nikon dslr and nikkor lens and again no problems.  Then I bought the \"waterproof\" nikon.  It did well until we went to the Bahamas. Second day of an eight day vacation we went snorkling. Max depth was maybe 10 feet.  Came out of the water and it would not turn on.  Opened battery compartment , wheel was in lock position, inside was water, ruined.  Previous year was used in pool, beach, etc with no problems.  I think that it was just not made well enough for serious water use.  Will not buy again.

Lorenz", "ReviewID": "R10BW6FSCWTSJR", "Overall": "1.0", "Content": "Short of it: Failed in shallow water like so many other peoples AW110.We purchased this camera a few weeks before a trip to St John Virgin Islands that involved a lot of snorkeling. The camera controls and features are great. The pictures were good quality for a little point and shoot. The pictures before the trip in a pool came out wonderful. The only issue that we had with it was that 3 days into our trip it died. The screen went black which made the camera little more than useless. Many other people complain of the same issue with it so it seems to be a fairly common fault with this model. The deepest we went with it was probably 5 or 6 feet, most of the time was surface snorkeling. If you want a camera that can get splashed while you are boating this is probably a good idea. If you want something that can go into a couple feet of water stay away from this camera. It seems unimaginable that it could actually go to the 18 meters and still function when so many of them break a couple feet from the surface. In short we want to love this camera, we tried to love this camera, the features are great, except the one feature that we bought it for, to use in water. Nikon if you actually had this camera waterproofed it would be a killer, instead it scares me away from your brand. Feel free to keep my camera that I used for 3 days and just sent in for warranty until you solve this problem since it's pretty useless to me as it is now.Update: We received an estimate from Nikon of $148.84 to repair this camera. The paperwork said that it was not covered by warranty. When I call to get more information as to why they denied the warranty I just get a message that says all their staff is assisting other calls then their phone system hangs up.

I have multiple Nikon dSLRs and lenses and have been very happy with them.  I now wish that I had paid closer attention to the other negative reviews.In good sunlight, this camera takes decent pictures.  I have only used dSLRs for a few years, and the pictures are not as good, but I didn't expect them to be.  I was primarily interested in the rugged and waterproof features.I ordered the camera over a month in advance of a vacation that was to include snorkeling.  With some light use, the back screen of the camera was scratched and scuffed, but I didn't worry about that because it did not affect the use or picture quality.The major problem was that within 10 minutes of taking the camera into the ocean, and with the camera not getting more than a foot or two under water (this was before we even started snorkeling), the screen died and went completely black.  Even after letting the camera dry out, the screen will not turn on.For the money, this camera is at best a mediocre point-and-shoot.  The only real advantage (in theory) would be the ruggedness and waterproofing features, but they do not hold up in real world use.

Having used several underwater cameras for years (but never a Nikon) with excellent luck, I figured the technology was pretty well refined at this point. I could not have been more wrong. This camera failed after only a few hours of snorkeling on our recent trip to Hawaii, forcing us to purchase a new camera (a FinePix XP65 which was much cheaper, not rated anywhere near this camera's depth, and which after many more days of snorkeling still works!) The failure also prevented us from taking photos during the most beautiful of our snorkeling events (Kapoho Tide Pools). Like many, my screen failed first, and the entire camera failed shortly thereafter. So believe the reviews, there is something wrong with this model; either a design flaw in the model line or severe quality control issues are causing the waterproofing to fail even when the camera is taken no where near the rated depth.

Tucker \"Looking for the Best\"", "ReviewID": "RBZNGSZ1U0WV6", "Overall": "3.0", "Content": "I bought this at Best Buy because I returned two Canon D20s to Amazon. Both specimens of the D20 had miserable audio on video playback. Yes, right out of the box. Because of this I decided to go to Best Buy where I could actually listen to some playback. Also so I could try the image stabilization effectiveness.Here is some background. I have been using a waterproof Pentax Optio W20 for the last several years. I visit Hawaii and snorkel extensively and make lots of family movies/dvds. (See link below for my 3 minute turtle video.) The Optio has a couple of issues: it makes a loud noise if you zoom while videoing, and the image stabilization is not highly effective. (I have an old man's Benign Familial Tremor.) On the plus side the Pentax has served for 5 or so years and...most importantly....it does NOT leak.In general I am not inclined to be needing special effects and am not fussy about image quality. I am willing to accept on faith that Nikon will meet muster on the image quality count. Besides, I have another almost-DSLR I use on land most of the time.I went with this Nikon after trying it at Best Buy. (Yes, I know I \"ate\" the sales tax.) I will probably keep it but there are some noticeable caveats I will mention. The camera meets my needs for IS; it zooms during video capture--which not all do--and the zoom is noiseless in my first trial.First, you need to understand the wifi is, in my terms, \"crippled\". I had hoped (presumed) the camera would be as smart as my Smartphone and be able to \"share\" pictures directly from the camera via my email or other account. Not so. Instead, all the camera does is set up an ad hoc (computer to computer) network. You connect your \"device\"  to the camera via the ad hoc network, upload the picture to the device, reconnect your device to your wifi network, and proceed to \"share\" as you choose...from your device. (The upload is accomlished via a free Nikon app you load on your device.)In my case, I do most of my emailing from my computer--a Mac Air. I may as well remove the sd card from the camera and put in into the card slot on my computer. (I hate cables, and Nikon is not my friend in this regard. Their camera cable appears to be proprietary; or at least it is NOT a micro or a mini USB.)You can also control the camera using the on-device app. Why would you want to do this? Sorry to display my lack of inventiveness.Note: In Nikon's wifi design a computer such as my Mac Air is not a device...it has to be an ipad, a smart phone, or an android tablet. The wifi would make sense if your home base is such a device. Many devices--esp. iPads-- do not accept SD cards so the wifi would be a way to get an image transferred from the camera to the device.Note also: Movie files cannot be transferred using the wifi app. The Nikon website advertises that they can be so transferred but the Nikon app says they cannot. You probably would not want to transfer movies via wifi anyway due to the file sizes involved.Another annoyance with this camera is the menu/submenu displays. Under some of the menus there are more sub-items than can fit on the screen, so scrolling is necessary. Fair enough. But there are no up/down indicator arrows to tell you if there are more submenu items, and whether they are available by scrolling up or scrolling down.In time I may come to find utility in the GPS capability but for now I am thinking I will leave it off. I always know where I am when I take a picture and I am not into geo-caching.Given that GPS will take more battery power, you may be interested in the batteries I just got from Amazon. link: Pack Of 2 EN-EL12 Batteries for Nikon Coolpix AW100 AW110 S31 S800C S6100 S6200 S6300 S8100 S8200 S9050 S9100 S9200 S9300 S9400 S9500 P300 P310 P330 S$12.99 for the two.They are rated at 1700 mah. The Nikon battery is rated at 1050 mah.Minor item: the charger comes with a 6' cord. Travelling pain. The Canon charger plugged directly into the wall with folding prongs. Much more compact. I am thinking about cutting some length out of my cord.I have not tried the Nikon underwater. I do like the door closure mechanism. It seems very positive and because to lock it you are turning a wheel--essentially a gear....I am believing there is more mechanical advantage to make the seal.Turtle video[...]", "Date": "April 25, 2013"}, {"Title": "Stopped working after one use", "Author": "A.

My third compact Canon (and second Elph) in the last decade finally bit the dust last month after I dumped it in a saltwater creek. Nikon's new, tough AW110 seemed like a good next choice for the clutzy, outdoorsy type.Canons are durable enough; that was by no means the first time I dropped that Elph--just the last time :-/  But the waterproofness, shockproofness and WiFi in the AW110 roped me in. Still, I'm a Canon fan, so that's where I'm coming from as I review this Nikon. I've also only had the Nikon for 2 weeks, so I might update this review later.In summary, the Nikon AW110 isn't as slick as comparable Canons; it's slower, with fewer options. But its ruggedness gives me confidence in packing it to head out on the water or into the wilderness. And despite its drawbacks, the photos that the AW110 are producing are what earn it 4 stars. More details:CONS- Too easy to pick up lens flare on sunny days.- Manual is EXTREMELY incomplete, and I'm having trouble finding camera forums or tutorials online to fill in the blanks.- Lens is at the top left on the camera, and for some reason, my finger wants to go there, so photos occasionally have fingertips in them.- Contrast is too strong in high-sun situations. Switching shooting mode can help, but it seems silly and time consuming to continually adjust shooting modes. I've defaulted at leaving it in \"easy auto mode,\" letting the camera choose, with mixed results.- Very few self-timer options (no custom option).- Slow turnover time after a photo is taken (a full few seconds more than Canon) and \"continuous\" photo option (find this in shooting mode --> scene mode --> sports) is slower and much more limited as well. I'll be experimenting with smaller photo-file sizes to see if that speeds it up.- Too many steps to shift over to macro mode.- The little lens gets dust and dirt on it that makes a big difference in photos if  not caught. I haven't found the best cleaning methods in the manual. The glass over the lens seems tough, which is good because, again, I'm hard on cameras and have already been resorting to using a dry edge of a towel to wipe water and dirt off the glass.- Charger is huge. Really, Nikon?EHHH - MIDDLEGROUND- Altimeter is a cool idea, but I can't figure out how to calibrate it using GPS, and you're supposed to set it \"every time\" you use it (that's about all the manual tells you regarding this feature), or its accuracy isn't to be trusted. That's clunky.- Photos almost always need lots of editing (the Canons could rock out photos that didn't need as much help), but edited versions turn out generally more amazing and dramatic than what the Canons produced. - WiFi only links to mobile devices with a (free) Nikon app downloaded. Even on my old Android, this worked well, but I'm still disappointed it doesn't connect to a laptop.PROS- Edited photos are stunning: sharp with good color.- Underwater seems to work nicely.- Macro takes too to switch to, but the camera takes great pictures in this mode.- Feels durable; I have confidence in its toughness.- Nice size and weight; good pocket fit.- I know it's cheesy, but I like how the strap works (Canon Elph just came with a wristlet that attaches to a hole in one side of the camera. The AW110 has a long neck strap that attaches to both sides and is easy to tether to things like bikini straps).- Compass works well.- Fast setup: controls look like Canon and are easy to learn.

I have just returned from my second trip, and I took very special care of the camera, as previously.  It died on my second day or snorkeling - actually the LCD screen stays black, making the camera unusable.  We were in  Maui, and it was very disappointing to not have pictures to bring back.I took this camera to Grand Cayman for a snorkeling trip.  It was in the ocean for 6 days, often twice per day.  As a newbie at underwater photography, I had a lot to learn (still do!).  I was pleased with this camera's performance.  With adequate lighting, and clear conditions, I got some nice images.  The underwater mode kept colors from becoming too blue, and images were generally pretty sharp.  If you set the camera to \"Easy Auto\", it switches to underwater mode as soon as it hits the water.  Many of my images needed some sort of color correction, depending on the conditions, which can change frequently  and dramatically underwater.  Videos were great, except for lens noise during zooming.  The screen is tough to see underwater, especially in bright mid-day sun.  (From what I've read, all similar cameras have this issue to some extent).  Sometimes I felt like I was almost guessing, which was made more difficult because the lens is on the upper left of the camera, rather than centered.I had no problems with leaking or fogging, but I was very careful to rinse and soak the camera in fresh water, and thoroughly air-dry for at least an hour before opening the camera.  I never opened up the camera outside either, to avoid fogging from humidity.  The camera is quite small, and comfortable in my hand.  It feels \"tough\", and well-made.

Four stars for the Cons.  I bought this camera for my daughter who is a college student that was going to do research in the Amazon jungle at the Tiputini remote research station in Equator.  She was there for two months, used the camera daily and the photos it produced were research quality.  It rained almost every day and the official high end SLR was quickly left behind because Coolpix's high quality of pictures and the fact the it needed no protection from the elements.  She took a little over 3500 photos, yes 3500 and most were great.Pros:  The macro worked very well, the video was good with good sound. Does very well in the limited light of floor of the Jungle once the flash was adjusted. It was easy to use, carry and had good battery life.  Waterproof! It worked great in the pouring rain of the Amazon day in and day out. Takes rough use such as bouncing in a pack, being dropped and bonked into trees. Small enough to use one handed with small hands.Cons: The battery door seal let just enough water vapor in to fog the lens sometimes (a little light oil rubbed on the O ring fixed it mostly.  The battery is proprietary so it is best to bring another so one can be charging will using the other.  It is hard to switch modes quickly and hard to manipulate the lighting.Cannot comment much on the GPS.  It did tell how high up in the tree canopy she was but down on the jungle floor it had a rougher time acquiring her location.  Maybe the dense foliage dampens the signal.Her co-researchers openly stated they were jealous of the fact the she could use hers anytime anyplace.

I specifically bought this camera over other ones due to the 59' depth rating, which is about 20' better than all of the competition.  Overall, I was impressed by the specs, and I bought it.Initially, I was also excited to use Wi-Fi, figuring that I could just make it an Access Point, connect to it via SMB/CIFs and then pull images off.  Alternatively, uploading from the camera to a SMB/CIFs/FTP/Dropbox anything would've been nice.  It turns out the Wi-Fi features of this camera are basically unusable.  I can control the shutter from an app and see pictures remotely, but there's no way to get images off the camera via Wi-Fi which seems like the low-hanging fruit feature that makes Wi-Fi in a camera worthwhile.  Anyways, not a deal breaker, but just a disappointment.The camera seemed to take good pictures.  Not great, but considering the size, lens, etc. the pictures aren't bad and met expectations.  However, I found that while on vacation, the camera would regularly freeze.  The LCD screen would show live video of what you were looking at, but none of the buttons would work including Power On/Off.  The only way to rectify the freeze was to remove the battery (NOTE: this is not something you can do underwater).  The freezing seemed to happen more often when taking multiple photos in short time.  The camera would start to get a bit warm and then freeze after nearly every photo.  If you let it cool down, it would work well for a bit then start freezing again.  Fortunately, when I went diving, it never froze despite heavy use.  I hypothesize that underwater keeps the camera cooler and prevents the overheating/freezing condition.  It's worth noting that while it was warm outside when I used it, it wasn't that hot.  Max temps of 85F/30C.While diving, the camera worked well until about 30' deep (less than 10M).  At that point, you could start to see the LCD screen convex and would see bubbles form in between the glass as the pressure was making contact from the outer glass to that actual LCD panel.  At around 35', I started to get random errors from the camera such as, \"Cannot support this SD Card\" and other unusual behavior that made taking pictures impossible.  Once coming back to 30' or less, it would immediately start working again.  I did dive to about 50' with the camera, and it didn't break, but I left it off at those points since it wouldn't work anyways.All that said, I believe the 59' water depth is basically probably how deep you could dive with it \"OFF\".  Perhaps going lower than 59' could cause actual permanent structural damage.  In my experience, this camera did go down to 50' and survive the dive, but it does not actually function properly much past 30' deep.  I took it on three dives and this condition was repeatable all the time.  The screen bending at 30-35' really makes you hesitant to dive any deeper.I bought this camera at a local warehouse store with a pretty liberal return policy.  I will likely return it this weekend as it clearly doesn't live up to the expectations and with the freezing feature, it is hands-down the least reliable camera I've ever owned.Other final gripe:  There is no way to charge the battery via a cable. You must remove the battery and use the external charger.  This is inconvenient when traveling as you have to bring the charger which is fairly sizable and has a long cord, etc.  I preferred my past cameras that used Micro-USB to charge; with those I can just charge it right off of my computer's USB port and not have to bring more chargers and international adapters.  I understand it's waterproof, but there are already two other ports (HDMI, etc) under the battery cover.  It would've been thoughtful to allow cable charging from under the waterproof port.I gave it 2 stars rather than 1 because it did take good pictures and video and the battery life exceeded my expectations.  However, Nikon's overzealous marketing departments should be ashamed.  Any device intended for diving should function to the designed depth and even more.

I'm in the outdoors a lot so those are incredibly useful. I got polarizing and skylight filters too. Plus a lens cap. One  drawback is that the camera lens is exposed and could potentially get dirty or scratched.

Snorkeling mostly, and for that I haven't had any problems with leakage.  However, I also take great care to clean the seals of the battery hatch before taking it underwater.

I own another pro DSLR and a number of lenses from Nikon, and I purchased this one for snorkeling shots after a quick web search, trusting the Nikon quality.The camera is a complete disappointment to say the least. After one week the whole OLED display was covered by condensation. Just one day later the lenses were also fully covered. All care was taken to access the card/battery compartment only once the camera was totally dry/clean, and the compartment was always carefully closed. I do not do any diving; only snorkeling. So the camera was never any deeper than 1 meter in the water.After noticing the malfunction I searched the web for similar problems, and the number of comments stating the exact same issue was simply awkward. I was hopping this to be a just a bad unit, but it seems to have happened to many other not so satisfied customers.Today I switched the camera on to see if the battery was still charged, and switched the camera off. Before leaving for snorkeling I switched the AW110 once again, and realized that the welcome screen did not show up. I tried to switch the camera on several times again, but nothing at all. All controls were simply DEAD.What I find quite disturbing is that besides all comments I found before on the condensation issue, I realize now that there are a number of comments and blogs stating that the camera `simply did not work anymore'.Are we really talking about Nikon here?? I mean the Nikon quality? I mean, look at all the comments on the web. This is a joke.

After owning it a year, I took it snorkeling in 2 feet of water, and noticed a stream of bubbles coming out of the battery hatch.  Camera destroyed.But there are other problems.  The overall images lack contrast, probably because of the folded optical path.  The auto white balance is confused by many situations.  It is not uncommon to see a great image in the liveview screen while composing a shot -- say kids against backlit foliage.

Even in our natal Cuba Nikon is a brand that most people recognize and think as a quality camera. We have had several Nikon cameras over the years. I do a lot of kayaking, snorkeling, hiking etc so my last Nikon camera a Nikon cool pix that I loved fell into the water and die. I decided to buy another Nikon cool-pix but this time the waterproof version. I got the camera from Best buy. At the beginning everything was fine. It took exelent pictures, the underwater pictures were ok but I expected a better quality from Nikon. The underwater video was crappy but I have a Kodak play-sport that I mainly use for my underwater video shoots so no problem on that. After 2 trips to the reef the camera started to freeze on me. I was able to take 10-15 pictures and then it freezes I was able to do nothing not even turning the camera off. So I find myself swimming in the middle of the reef trying to wade the waves and keep the camera over the water so I was able to take the battery out and then put it in again that way I was able to shoot another 10-15 pictures and bang it freezes again and again. The problem got so bad that at the end I was only able to take 1-3 pictures before it freezes. I went to best buy and bought the last model of the Olympus Tough series the TG2. Nikon is a good company no doubt on that but this is just their second waterproof camera so some glitches and problems are expected, Olympus has a long long history of building waterproof cameras I hope Nikon will fix this and improve on the next model they launch.Another problem I found is that in the Nikon camera the lenses are in one side of the camera and that makes very easy for your finger to appear in the picture. Some times you are diving and a shark appears in front of you and you got the perfect moment to take a picture. you are not going to have time to think where to put your hand correctly on the camera. That is another feature I like from the latest Olympus tough TG2 the objective is in the center of the camera just like in any regular camera. I don't know what is the point on having the objective to one side of the camera.One feature that Nikon should add is the possibility to add different lenses to the camera, fish eye lens etc. Being a rough camera you are going to use it in many different extreme environments an for taking many different extreme pictures so the ability to have difference lenses will be nice.

Image quality is very sharp and clear with lots of quick image effect options4. Very light weight compared my older Olympus5. Movie setting is one button push and you are recording.... this is a great feature eliminating all the dial setting first6. WiFi took all of 45 seconds to set up and works great7. Battery life is pretty much all day long of use at an amusement park with kids so you know lots of pictures8. Nice big screen on back9. Has a filter adapter which is good - haven't used it but it's made of plastic and seems kind of cheesy.10. Battery and Memory card compartment door is secured by a large locking/rotating knob.  CON1. Lens does not have an automatic shut off cover - this is a good feature on my older Olympus (you do get a little brush)2. Easy Auto Setting is terrible - no user controls and doesn't adapt well to changing environments3. Little bit expensive and does NOT include the SD card in the box4. Buttons are plastic and small.  My thumb easily covers the whole control area.5. Zoom toggle switch is in an awkward position but works ok6. Action button and use is annoying and not as good as Olympus tap function.

Having received it and started fooling around with it I will absolutely not keep it after the vacation.At first glance this is a well built camera and I'm excited to do underwater photography. It has a good depth rating for the money. I'll simply break down what I find to be the pluses and minuses.PROS:Well builtGood button layoutImage quality is good. Don't have much to compare it to but I like what I've shot so far.It is more than just waterproof. It is also drop proof to 6.6ft. This would be a good camera to take hiking too.CONS:You must remove the battery and charge it externally. Not that big of a deal but when you do this you lose all of your settings. You must set up the camera all over again every time you charge it. Ridiculous.Wireless access is off and greyed-out in the menu. I have no way to activate it apparently. The menu does not mention it whatsoever.This is my second Nikon camera, the other being a mid-range DSLR I bought 4 years ago. It will be my last. Both cameras had strong points but ultimately had such irritating drawbacks that they weren't worth owning. It certainly isn't a piece of garbage, but unless you need to shoot underwater I would avoid this camera.UPDATE: I ended up returning this camera immediately after returning from the honeymoon that I bought it for. The camera locked up CONSTANTLY which necessitated pulling the battery out. To do so you must break the seal so while it was somewhat possible when we were walking waist deep in the water off the beach (still not a good idea though), it was completely impossible while snorkeling obviously. It nearly ruined my ability to record my honeymoon, and I lost a lot of good images and videos because it would be locked up while snorkeling and I wouldn't know it (it is nearly impossible to make out the screen while underwater so you basically just point and click and pray it is recording).", "Date": "May 8, 2013"}, {"Title": "Nikon COOLPIX AW110 16 MP Waterproof Digital Camera with Built-In Wi-Fi", "Author": "dslee", "ReviewID": "R1W3WHVC27SYDF", "Overall": "1.0", "Content": "Camera fogs up pretty fast - then you have to dry it and then it fogs right back upHad the camera on the countertop inside, and when I looked at the camera, not only did the lens fogged up, the back display fogged up too.Also, I have lost the back display, blank/black.When I turn the camera on it will take pictures, but nothing to display.When I hit the record button, the camera shuts down most of the time.

Bressi", "ReviewID": "R2LU4LKIUMB8IK", "Overall": "3.0", "Content": "After using the camera a bit - I can now comment.  On the positive side the camera takes nice pictures and uses a standard USB charger, it is nice not to have to carry a separate charging device.  However, the camera and its features are not very user friendly.  The flash options are either Auto or Off.  There were a couple of situations where we had a bright background and needed to use a flash and could not - because there is no \"flash on\" option.  The WIFI is a big disappointment because it requires the use of a proprietary app to work.  I loaded the app on my phone and on my tablet and the ICON disappeared from the menu on both devices.  When I tried to re-install the app - it would not because it was already installed.  The ICON eventually reappeared on my phone - but not on my tablet.  Both are android.  Also, the PC app will not let you download pictures to the computer.  Bottom line - I am shifting the chip just like with my old camera.  With regard to the GPS - It works - but it  needs much improvement.  The GPS coordinates will transfer to windows, but the location data does not.  Also, the coordinates do not transfer to Google Maps.  The map coordinates were read by only one of my map apps.  I had to manually insert the places into the pictures.  Regarding the location data.  For one, it can not be updated - says that right in the manual.  This is crazy because locations change all the time.  Also, we just took a Caribbean cruise and had no location data outside of the United States.  Nikkon needs to work more interoperability into its features.

It's loaded with great features, most of which I don't need. The pdf manual is 252 pages, which tells you how complex this thing really is. When I see that a camera is rated at 16mp I would have thought that the file size at maximum resolution would be much larger than 3-4 mb. I don't understand that. Pictures are adequate, since I have several high-end cameras for when I really need high quality. I bought this just to have a small pocket camera that I can carry around all the time. I don't dive, so I'm not worried about the waterproof feature although it will be handy when I go fishing or kayaking. I like the GPS feature, although the elevation does not show up in the images' metadata - only the coordinates. The Wi-Fi is a different story. I was of the impression that I would be able to download pics directly to my PC via my home network. Not so! Big disappointment, but not a major problem.

While Amazon's prices are usually way better than what I can get in a local store, that was not the case here. $246 seems a bit high for what you get. I bought this at a major membership warehouse. Got it for $199 and that included a package of other goodies: a nice case that Amazon sells separately for around $33; an 8GB SD card, a filter adaptor that mounts on the front of the lens; AV cable for connecting the camera directly to a TV; plus a coupon for 100 free 4x6 prints.

I started with Nikon Coolpix in May 2002 and then had 4 Canons before I bought this Nikon in December 2013. I wanted a waterproof camera that had extra features, because, let's face it, Canons tend to lack on the cool features category. This camera let me down a LOT. In many of my comparisons, I am comparing to my Canon Powershot 310 HS ELPH. I took side-by-side comparison pictures in many of the scenarios that I compare to in my review.Camera body- It is a bit bulkier than my canons, which I expected because of the waterproof capabilities. It was comfortable in my hand.The blue color was gorgeous, and the buttons were squishy like everyone said, but I didn't mind it at all. The one thing that is annoying is the location of the lens. It makes it VERY easy to block with your finger, but I'd prefer the lens there as opposed to the flash because at least you can see when you've blocked the lens (My Canon has the flash in that spot and when it gets blocked you don't know until after you've snapped a bad picture). The locking system to keep it waterproof was mostly effective, but after 3 beach days, it somehow got sand in there, and this is THICK white sand from Grand Cayman... I have no idea how it got in there, and I'm lucky it didn't ruin the waterproof capabilities. Shutter button is easy to press (and press halfway to focus first)Menus- The menu screens were very basic, and they looked EXACTLY the same as my first Nikon 11 years ago... It's time for an update. Though the menu screens were easy to navigate, they were very slow. Also, it was confusing to get to the different GPS options, and some options I probably never used because I just couldn't find them.General camera use- This was pretty easy....  I found myself using the scene buttons frequently to get the best shot as compared to my Canon which I just use the P setting for, but Nikon lacks some of the options that canon has which made me upset. They have no color options like \"Vivid\" that I use with sunsets with my Canon. The underwater scene was perfect for underwater shots while snorkeling. I took shots without that scene and then with, and it was clear that the scene mode made a huge difference. One thing that was a HUGE let-down was how long it took for the flash to load between shots. I know that typically, Canon cameras have slower shot-to-shot times, and this Nikon was WORSE. I was very surprised because I didn't read any other reviews that mentioned this.Picture quality- nothing to brag about, nothing to complain about. The pictures were fine, but many were very grainy compared to my Canon. This was especially true when you zoomed in, though the Nikon is supposed to have higher pixel count than the Canon. It beat my Canon out in exposure compensation for close up portraits, (something canons tend to not do well with) but everything else, the Canon (that is 2 years old) was FAR superior with. Landscape shots, group pictures, etc... The canon was much better than this Nikon. Darn.Video Quality- HORRIBLE!!! I could not believe this, but it was horrendous. The video was choppy, got grainy at points, and then, to top it all off, the SOUND DID NOT MATCH UP!!! That reason alone was enough for me to return it. Really, really, bad.The one thing I liked about this Nikon over my Canon is the ability to do panorama by just sweeping the camera across.... I have NO idea why Canon has not adapted this technology yet. However, even on this Nikon, the technology was NOT perfect. You had to hold it PERFECTLY straight across or it would fail...Overall, I will be returning this camera. Definitely NOT worth the two-hundred I paid for it. I think it would be worth it to pay 300 and splurge on a DSLR. I'm disappointed, Nikon, and because of this camera, I will probably go back to Canon (or try out another new brand).", "Date": "January 5, 2014"}, {"Title": "When it works its great, but it might let you down", "Author": "Chucktastic", "ReviewID": "RTFGIGEOVO8E2", "Overall": "2.0", "Content": "Ordered this as a gift for my wife for our Christmas honeymoon cruise to the Caribbean so I wouldn't have to bring my DLSR.

It's rated for up 18m in depth, the maximum depth for PADI Open Water certification.This camera is loaded interesting features.  GPS, compass (which was useful while underwater), and wifi, which allowed me to transfer pictures to my android phone.  This with an adapter for 40.5mm filters that allowed me to use an underwater red filter with this camera.  The battery life is good, although the bulky charger could be smaller.  The manual white balance feature has been very useful.  This camera doesn't save images in RAW format, which would've been very useful for adjusting color balance after taking pictures.During the 1st dive on my trip, I noticed the outer window of the screen concaving inward as I went deeper.  Then at around 10m, the window was touching the OLED screen.  There's a sealed air gap between the window and the screen which cannot be pressure-equalized, causing the window to bend inward as you go deeper underwater... not a good design.  However, I went down to 15m with no functional.  I have read other reviews where this camera failed while snorkeling/diving during vacation.  Fortunately, this wasn't the case for me.A few weeks later, I took further PADI certification and had this camera with me.  While in the middle of an underwater photography session at no more than 8m depth, the screen suddenly failed with no warning signs.  The rest of the camera was still functional, but it was useless without a working screen.  After soaking the camera in cool fresh water and letting it dry, I opened the battery cover and did not notice any moisture, dirt, or anything unusual.  I called Nikon and sent my camera in for warranty repair.  Nikon repaired the camera under warranty and sent it back within a week, although they denied this being a common issue with this particular model, despite this issue not being an isolated one.  This fact leads me to believe that the underwater design flaw is still in existence of this model.This is a good camera if was more reliable at being waterproof up to 18m.  If you're a scuba diver and plan to buy this camera (or already have it), do yourself a favor and get an underwater housing for it.

It seems incredible to me that Nikon has created such a weak app for their wireless feature and incredible that no one has filled in the void.

Nikon should be ashamed of the quality that is missing in that area.Aside from terrible Wi-Fi features, I found the camera to be fairly easy to use, fairly rugged, happily waterproof (though you do need to dry off the lens as so water drops or spots don't interfere with your images - true on any camera), and generally a good point and shoot camera.

Not really a photography expert but I love the photo quality and also the video quality.  Came upon the Nikon AW110, so my nephew now have my Nikon AW100, which I'm sure he's excited to use.  Only used the Nikon AW110 twice while snorkeling in Guam and so far, so good.  I just wished I bought an extra battery.

I only plan on taking this down maybe 20 feet at most, so it should do just fine for that application.I've been playing around with normal pictures. This camera is totally awesome. It's one of those cameras that the display ON the camera, is just that.. a display. Meaning, when you put the picture on a HD tv, or computer monitor, the picture is a ton better! The camera has all kinds of preset modes. Pet, low light, party indoor, macro, fireworks, etc. You can easily / quickly navigate to the presets and manual settings. The zoom is all digital - so .. it's.. okay. But, at 16 megapixels, you can zoom all you want to, later at home.The battery life is average. If you are using the GPS, and tracking yourself, and doing all of this optional stuff, yeah - the battery dies out decently fast. Otherwise, it's average. So I purchased a 3rd party battery and charger kit for super cheap here on Amazon.com.The build quality on this camera is super solid. It is somewhat beefy and has a heft to it. Nothing that will tear your pants off of you or anything. But, it's not dinky feeling by far.The memory card and battery pack are inside of a closed water-tight hatch. Thats where the connectors are too. So, you don't have some junky little plastic flap covering a USB connetion - hoping its closed when you get under the water. heheheh.

She was fine, but the camera really took a beating.  It was fully submerged and hit the rock before she did.  Not a scratch on it, though!  Nothing slowed this camera down.

Oh and it takes pics in a flash, too.  There were many times we caught wildlife along the river that we had no warning of and only seconds to get a good shot.  I kept the camera hooked to my life jacket (when it was my turn to carry it) so it was always within reach.

I have taken tons of photos with it.  Although I do prefer DSLR over point and shoots, this cameria is holding its own, especially with the adaptable filters you can use with it.  I had a 7 mp Sony point and shoot but that camera finally kicked the bucket after many fishing and hiking trips.  For not being waterproof or dropproof it held its own.I have yet to use the GPS or wireless feature on the AW110.  The main reason I purchased this camera was for fishing and particularly for hiking trips since packing light is essential on hiking trips.  No need to add the weight of a DSLR if a point and shoot can do just as a good a job especially if you are an experienced photographer.  I am going on a 6 day hiking trip on the Foothills Trail in South Carolina in November and I plan to put this camera to the test on its first hiking trip.  I will utilize the GPS feature and see how accurate it will be in the mountains.  I will still do a test run before taking it on the trip.  This trail is 77 miles long and packed with waterfalls and mountain views.Menus and features on the camera are easy to use and self explanatory really.

Needless to say, this camera met and exceeded my expectations in performance. When I bought it, I expected some sort of picture-quality tradeoff for all the features this camera has. It didn't. The camera still delivers high-definition photos and videos. 1080p. Sound quality on the videos can suck if the source is farther away (such as at a live concert). If you're recording someone talking, you won't have a problem with it.I took this camera snorkeling, into the pool, and scuba diving down to 25 feet, and it's still kicking strong. I was worried at one point when there appeared to be a hazy film of moisture in the screen after leaving it in the pool for about an hour, but placing it in a sunny spot on some towels remedied that problem.Its auto mode is great for new camera users, but if you're a more advanced user, you can select different modes for different situations (there is a mode for every situation thinkable...from low-light outdoor landscape shots, to food shots, to pet shots).It also features a GPS system, which logs the exact coordinates (and compass direction you were facing!) of *almost* every photo you shoot (depends on GPS uplink connection). I thought that was pretty cool, because I travel a lot and think it's pretty interesting to be able to pull up a map of every location I've snapped a photo.I bought the 110 model, which features a wifi app that allows you to wirelessly link this thing to devices that do not have a SD card slot (e.g. Apple products). You'll have to install an app, but it's worth it. This app allows me to wirelessly transfer photos from my camera, take photos using my iPhone as a remote, and view albums from my phone.A feature I have yet to use is the I-have-fat-fingers/I-am-wearing-snowgloves button on the side of the camera. By depressing this button, you can flip through different commands such as \"take photos,\" \"view photos,\" \"change mode,\" etc. by simply shaking the camera. I expect to use this button a lot when I take my camera snowboarding this year. It has the qualities a Go-Pro, but with more options.Bottom line: If you're a world traveler, and are expecting to do a lot of diverse things on your trips, from the skies to the oceans, or from the slopes to the backpacking trails, this camera is for you.", "Date": "July 17, 2013"}, {"Title": "A great little camera, but the shake feature is useless", "Author": "Clara", "ReviewID": "R29UQ6MRORGVL9", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "We live near the ocean and have boats and kayaks which we use regularly.

I tried it again and again with the same result. I tried it with and without different memory cards. I tried it after pulling the battery out and back in, and making sure the battery orientation was correct. I studied the manual but found no special startup instructions or description of the exclamation point screen in the troubleshooting section.At the hotel I recharged the battery to make sure that wasn't the problem, but the next day the camera behaved similarly.To explain my prior camera history and experience, previously I've owned waterproof cameras by Olympus and Fuji but since gave them away to relatives. I also shoot with the Fuji X-100s, a Canon DSLR, and several Lumix micro four thirds cameras and lenses. For this waterproof camera, I should have chosen the Lumix or Olympus or even GoPro waterproof cameras, but I thought that this would be a good opportunity to try a Nikon interface.In this day and age a consumer electronic product from a major brand that flashes an error screen right out of the box?

I wanted to have something more compact for less technical photos and videos and purchased the AW110 with an eye towards using it at zoos, aquariums, parks and on outings where a dSLR is too bulky or intrusive.  While the AW110 is smaller than I'd expected, it's not at all user friendly.  Even attempting to simply use the pre-programmed settings for macro close-ups, \"sports\" action, pets and similar functions failed to achieve the desired results.  More distressing, I would play with settings to get the image to look right on the screen then take a photo and find that the photo looked nothing like what the screen showed.  I would try to compensate to get the look I had seen on the screen and spent 15-20 minutes on a photo that I took & got the right look with one exposure from my iPhone.  Now granted it's an iPhone 5, but I really had expected the AW110 to be more effective and useful than an iPhone.  Apparently, this is not the case.  I got so frustrated with this little camera, I was tempted to throw it in the trash.  I went back to the car and got my dSLR and took photos that looked right after a single shot when the AW110 took 5-6 shots to achieve correct exposure.  In addition, the lens constantly fails to focus, then the camera software resets itself wasting time that could be spent shooting.

I bought a case especially after purchasing and put it straight in there - How the **** did that happen?!! Right now the screen is scuffed pretty much all over and I don't know how it is happening so easily! I treat my iPhone (using now to write this) far worse and the screen still looks good as new - I've also just noticed the writing on the front is all rubbing off! Sure I don't really care about the looks but surely this should not be happening on a 'rugged' camera?2) I like to mess around with white balance - not impressed with the AWB and equally not impressed with the manual set white balance (which is kinda laborious to go and set each time too) much prefer my old canon IXUS3) I also like to mess about with long shutter times and kicked myself for forgetting to check if this camera can do it - it can't as far as I can work out... :( the longest is 4 seconds using the 'fireworks' scene mode... (Which means you also cannot use manual white balance in a scene mode...)4) Pictures - they're OK and I am most definitely no pro photographer but my old Canon IXUS that this has replaced seems to take far superior looking photo's5) The action button (the button you use to take the photo!) is hard to press and try to keep the camera still at the same time in my opinion6) The BIGGEST one and the reason that has prompted me to add this review is that the lens has just misted up!!! It's hardly been in the water! I tested it on day one in a sink full of water (break it in gently...) and no apparent problems - meticulously dried it and noticed there are holes around the lens area that were holding water in there so really let it dry out properly - since then it's been in the shallows in the sea twice (literally just took it in with me when paddling about in the surf at the shore) - taken back to hotel room and dried meticulously each time before opening battery cover... I am on the beach now and was just taking some shots then about to head in for a swim/snorkel and noticed the lens misted up...I am majorly ****** at myself and feel like kicking my own butt from here back to Bangkok to return it but I bought it knowing full well 'no returns' and that the warranty (Thailand only...) only covers 'faults' not water related damage...!How Nikon can sell this I don't know... Perhaps they will admit a design/build fault and some kind of recall?I will have a stab at trying to get my money back one way or another and attempt to contact Nikon directly (this is NOT a cheap camera!) but I think I have about as little chance of that happening as this camera surviving any more water related activities...Why people are giving it 5 stars and saying they have not even tried it in the water is beyond me - surely there are a billion and one cameras on the market that take just as good photos for a quarter of the price that work 'out of the water' - the uniqueness of the AW 110 is that it is supposed to be ruggedised no...?

This AW110 is awesome for the price though. The auto ISO is a tad slow which is expected. The auto focus isant as fast as a DSLR which I also expected and I dont know why Nikon says this camera is good in low light : / when the specs Nikon gives, clearly says to a person who knows better that (this camera is not good in low light)... but I already new that before I bought it! I still love the camera! All the features it has are great and I am going to keep it for fishing and camping and what ever else. Dont drop the camera or you will need to send it back to Nikon for them to check it out and make sure the water seal isant broken. If you dont ship it back to them after dropping it and you submerge the camera in water and it fails to work, it will be your fault and Nikon will not honor the warranty... TRICK OF THE CENTURY LOL F'N NIKON LOL!!! JUST DONT DROP IT... I dont care about what professionals say about this camera!

I can't give you any insight into it's features because the stupid thing wouldn't turn on. I kept getting a white screen with a little exclamation point in a red circle. Since there is no mention of this anywhere on the internet, I figured that maybe the battery was exhausted. So, I charged both of the batteries overnight. Apparently, sometime after I plugged in the Nikon battery, the charger stopped working. This happened when I took it out of the box as well. It blinks for about 5 minutes, and then stops blinking, which is supposed to signify that it's fully charged. Nope. So I let it sit overnight, and nothing happened.However, while I was looking up info on my red exclamation point issue, I found many many many complaints about the fact that this doesn't usually work underwater like it says it's supposed to. The reviews on Nikon's website were awful, and reviews on other camera-related sites were similar. I don't think this camera is worth the hassle, so I returned it for a Nikon Coolpix L820.
