It takes a beating and is still working great.  It takes awesome photos during the day and at night.  We haven't hat a chance to test it out to see how waterproof it is yet but just give my son time!  Our only complaint is that it is not the best for action photos.  All in all a good first camera.", "Date": "August 23, 2013"}], "ProductInfo": {"Price": "$64.95", "Features": "KIT INCLUDES 5 PRODUCTS -- All BRAND NEW Items with all Manufacturer-supplied Accessories + Full USA Warranties:\n<1> Bell & Howell Splash WP10 Shock & Waterproof Digital Camera (Green) +\n<2> Transcend 8GB microSDHC Card +\n<3> PD Memory Card Storage Wallet +\n<4> PD 5pc Complete Cleaning Kit + <5> PD Flexible Table Mini Tripod", "Name": "Bell & Howell Splash WP10 Shock & Waterproof Digital Camera (Green) with 8GB Card/Reader + Case + Tripod + Kit", "ImgURL": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/51ToCu94seL._SY300_.jpg", "ProductID": "B00AB077LE"}}
