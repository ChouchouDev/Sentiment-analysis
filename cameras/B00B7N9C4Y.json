{"Reviews": [{"Title": "Another great camera from Nikon", "Author": "Person", "ReviewID": "R3HCUERX3QDZY", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I have had a Nikon Coolpix S600 for 5-6 years now and it has been my go to camera to have around because of it's handy size and it has never let me down, except that recently the zoom function is intermittently working.  So, I decided to replace it with the S9500 and just got it this past week and really wanted to put it through the paces a bit to see how functional it would be around town and in the field.The wi-if transfer is really handy when your out and about and want to transfer photos to a cell phone or tablet that has data capability so they can be uploaded to a website or to just back them up on another device.  I used my iPad and the free app from Nikon called Wireless Mobile Utility (WMU) which can be found in the App Store, it's really quick and easy to use. It also allows you to setup your camera and remotely take pictures with the app, I found that I could only be about 30 feet away from the camera with my iPad before the wi-if signal was lost so it has range limitations.The 22x zoom is fantastic for this size of a camera, it takes really nice clear photos even zoomed all the way out.  The anti vibration works well also if you al moving about and taking action shots.One big complaint I have so far is the placement of the record button for starting video recording.  I have hit this button numerous times on accident and there is no way to disable the video record function, it's always at the ready when you are in photo mode.", "Date": "March 2, 2013"}, {"Title": "Firmware update could make this camera great", "Author": "Dave L", "ReviewID": "R3KWXFQIS2Q4FS", "Overall": "1.0", "Content": "In the couple of weeks I've had the camera, I've really enjoyed it. In good light, it takes great pictures with vibrant colors and the flash works very well. The menu system is well designed which provides easy access to all of the camera's functions. I especially like the GPS features and panorama and 3D modes. Of course, the 22x zoom is great.One big problem however is the cameras operation in even moderately low light situations. There are times when it refuses to focus even in normal indoor lighting especially when the zoom is being used. This prevents even taking a flash photo. It's especially frustrating since it seems to start out with a good focus and then veers away from it when it locks in. I'm hoping this is just a bug that could be fixed in firmware. My son's camera from a competitor works perfectly every time in identical situations.The omission of an AC adaptor that allows operation of the camera (in addition to charging) is baffling. The cumbersome battery substitute adaptor is a poor alternative to this obvious feature. Not a deal breaker though.Most importantly, certain basic functions are missing from the firmware. It's as if a marketing guy told the engineers to get rid of every extra item that could confuse a user rather than sensibly tucking them away into a separate area for when the user gains more experience. Here is a list of seemingly simple changes that I hope find their way into a firmware update before I have to decide whether to return the camera:1. Get rid of the GPS log warning when powering down or at least let the user dismiss it. Waiting 10 seconds before you can put it back in your pocket gets annoying very quickly.2. Provide basic shutter and aperture priority modes. The camera often makes wrong decisions, especially in dim light, and this would provide a fallback.3. Provide additional focus modes for infinity (without having to be limited to a landscape scene) and maybe a distance focus control for situations where the automatic modes don't work. This may not be necessary if the engineers can get the low light focusing to work properly.4. Allow control over how long the preview shows after taking a picture.5. Allow edited images (zoomed, softened, etc) to be transferred via wifi. The instructions don't say they can't be transferred but they are disabled with an X through them on my iPhone with the Nikon app.6. Allow full res images to be transferred to a smart phone via wifi.There are probably more missing basic features but these are the ones I noticed right away. The first three especially are reason enough to return the camera if they are not fixed. It would be a shame for such a great camera to be hobbled by substandard firmware. Since I generally enjoy using the camera, I really hope Nikon is listening and has the technical skills to fix the problems.", "Date": "May 18, 2013"}, {"Title": "Great Camera For My Use", "Author": "Elliott", "ReviewID": "R2SL7O128SRHYQ", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "I will probably update after more use (especially in low light situations), but so far this camera is great for what I will use it for.  I love concerts so that is my main point of having a camera and then for family/friend get togethers.  I love the zoom on this camera and the many functions it comes with.  I can easily and quickly touch up photos right on the camera, which is a great function.  The GPS is there too, if needed, but I haven't really had the need to test that out.  It powers on quick, there are several settings to choose from, the look and feel of the camera is great!  I'm not too fond of where the flash is because I always end up putting my finger there to take a picture and have to remove it for the flash to come up, but that's just a habit I'll have to start putting my finger elsewhere!I originally went in to buy the Nikon P510 because I heard that was great in low light and has amazing zoom, but it was just too big for me at this time.  Maybe down the road I'll go toward that size, but it's not for me right now and was informed the S9500 had really good zoom and low light qualities as well.Two reasons for the 4 stars are:You have to charge the battery IN the camera.  The camera doesn't come with an external battery charger.  I had to buy an external charger (another $20) that plugs directly into the wall without the cord to charge the battery outside of the camera.  Nikon does sell an external batter charger for this but it's a charger that has a 4 ft cord that plugs into the wall case that came with the camera, again, not very functional unless you don't mind a long cord to charge your battery.  The cord for me would have sufficed if I couldn't find a different charger, but I did.  This comes in a few days so if it works, great!  If not, then I will go back and get the corded charger.The second reason is the WiFi.  Not a deal breaker for me, but it seems to be a bit finicky and doesn't stay connected very long.  The app needed for the WiFi isn't the greatest and the functions are very limited and you will need to set the settings on your camera to where they need to be before connecting WiFi because once WiFi is on, you cannot change settings on your camera (unless I'm missing something), only through your phone and those functions are limited to zooming in and out and is not quick at all.  It also took me some time to get the WiFi to connect, but I think this was because the instructions on it weren't the clearest.Overall, great camera for what I will use it for and the WiFi and battery aren't deal breakers for me.  I will update later once I put it to test in a concert setting.Update 4/28/13:  I took this camera to a concert last night and was rather impressed.  It took great pictures in the low light and the zoom is awesome!  I didn't zoom to the fullest as it wasn't needed, but am impressed.  And my battery was hardly used at all and I took about 100 pictures within a matter of a few hours.", "Date": "March 24, 2013"}, {"Title": "Awesome camera", "Author": "Suzanne S", "ReviewID": "R1E4GNOXHK9IQH", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "Love this camera right out of the box. It is replacing a Coolpix S8000 (the lens got scratched) which takes amazing pictures. The S9500 does everything the 8000 did and has a few new features that just make it so much fun! If you are used to a Nikon you will find it very easy to navigate. As a point and shoot camera it is a wonderful compliment to a DSLR (I shoot with a D300s). Sometimes you just want to travel light with a small camera that still allows you some control and flexibility. This camera also has a terrific wide angle to zoom lens which allows you to get the shot where ever you go. I haven't used the wifi feature yet but did want to share my enthusiasm for this camera!", "Date": "July 14, 2013"}, {"Title": "Love the camera, but...", "Author": "Elliot", "ReviewID": "R3M03OIOS8ETA4", "Overall": "3.0", "Content": "I have had the camera for about 5 days, using it every day with great results.  I would second all the positive things the posters above have said.  But today, the WiFi stopped working.  If I take out the battery and put it back in, it works again, but only for a few seconds.  I took 2 stars away for the hassle of having to send it back and wait for a new one.  I hope this is not a recurring problem.", "Date": "March 3, 2013"}, {"Title": "Unreliable.", "Author": "Elizabeth/Michael", "ReviewID": "R2RBPEOF8QJXXT", "Overall": "1.0", "Content": "First S9500 went back before we could even use it.  The battery wouldn't hold a charge longer than a day.  We thought, and still think it was a problem with the charging cord.Got a second one and took that S9500 on a two week trip.  We used it constantly so had a good opportunity to see results under repeated use.  Although this second one did much better on the battery charge, occasionally, it would register low or no battery and then turn off when it should have been charged.  Maybe this was a charging cord issue again (?)Sometimes too, we would have the opposite problem where it wouldn't turn off and we would have to turn it over and remove the battery to get it to turn off.The round dial on the top next to the shutter button that allows you to change the settings ie.  portrait, landscape etc. was a constant source of problems as well.  Ultra sensitive, putting it in and pulling it out of the case or handing it to another person could easily change the setting and we have lots of blurry pictures from the settings dial moving without our notice.With the exception of dial setting errors, pictures from the trip are crystal clear, the slim, lightweight design of the camera made it easy to tote around and pull out when needed.  The display monitor was great and the camera had more functions than I could ever begin to use but in the end, we weren't willing to put up with the little annoyances so it went back.", "Date": "June 25, 2013"}, {"Title": "Even better than the S9100!!!", "Author": "TAF", "ReviewID": "R85GZXXQCMT7T", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I had the S9100 camera, and this one is even better.  Easy enough to use for a complete noob, but with enough features that a somewhat advanced hobbiest can play with a lot of functionality.My level is wanting a great shot (often from a great distance) without having to carry around a giant bag of lenses and such.We took our S9100 on vacation to Alaska, and all the people with their $1000+ cameras were getting no better shots than we were, and we didn't have to change lenses, so didn't miss shots up-close or far-distant. In addition, we got HD video of the trip as good as fancy video cams!  (Just remember to change the video focus mode to continuous so that you can zoom in and out while taking video and the focus will adjust as you zoom.)  The dedicated video record button is a huge bonus, because it means you don't have to switch modes or dials or menu options to go straight from snapping a photo to recording a video.  We caught wildlife views that no one else could by one quick button press to record video.The S9500 is all this and more, with GPS tagging and increased Zoom to 22x.Bonus for me is that it takes the same EN-EL12 batteries as my S9100 took, so the extra batteries that I have fit it perfectly.My recommendation... get this camera...  Get the Square Trade Accident Protection Plan  purchase about 6 extra EN-EL12 batteries  get a Universal Digital Camera Charger for Li-Ion Batteries (charges many types of camera batteries with a wall plug and car plug included)  get 5 to 10 SDHC 8gb (or 16gb) \"Class 10\" (this allows high speed video to record longer) cards  a good quick access camera case  and \"GGS Optical Glass LCD Screen Protector 3 inches for Digital Cameras\" to protect the LCDSo what happened to my S9100?  It slipped out of my hand and hit the pavement on the only unprotected corner that my camera case didn't cover.  After getting a refund because they couldn't fix it from a big-box electronics store (after almost a year of them having my camera), I chose Amazon to buy the S9500 because the Square Trade Accident plan would have had my camera back or money to me in a very short time, and the Accident plan is much better than I could find anywhere else.", "Date": "July 29, 2013"}, {"Title": "Camera Freezes After a Few Shots", "Author": "Michael L.

It takes a good photo and is easy to use.  But after using it for about 2 weeks, it started freezing after taking a few shots.  I'd have to take the battery out to reboot and after that it would work for a few shots.  The problem is getting progressively worse and I'm sending it back today for repair.  For it's class this is a relatively expensive camera and it's disappointing to find this problem with the Nikon.

In a museum (with low but sufficient light), the camera just wouldn't focus within 5 feet (for example to take shots of placards instead of taking notes, or of various carvings).  I tried with no zoom, tried all the autofocus modes, then ultimately reset to factory defaults.  This helped a little bit, but still ended up with a lot of out of focus pictures.  There seemed to be a manual focus mode, but I couldn't figure it out.So the camera went back...It's great for outdoors.", "Date": "April 24, 2013"}, {"Title": "Great Camera", "Author": "Sammy", "ReviewID": "R26NJUQAIHWK0G", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "Even better camera than expected.

Nikon apparently thinks you'll shell out another $25 for this type of charger, which should come with the camera in the first place!In addition, others have complained about poor focusing in low light, and that the wi-fi will only transfer low-res versions of your photos, not your full-res originals.", "Date": "August 5, 2013"}, {"Title": "Not Good!", "Author": "K.

The 18.1 mp's are quite impressive and the shooting results are nothing less than extraordinary.  The CMOS allows shooting in very dim light without any loss in end product results.  And, of course, the camera still maintains the hallmark excellence of the Nikkor lens - probably one of the finest lens that is on the market today.But Nikon has not rested on just those remarkable laurels - they've moved with the times (as always) so the S9500 has a relatively easy WiFi function.  Coupled with a free app (I am using an iPad where the app is called NIKON WMU (wireless mobile utility)), you can immediately transfer your photos from the S9500 to a tablet, your phone or computer.  No wires or patching required before you are posting your beautiful photos onto Facebook or any other social network!There is also a built-in GSP that I am still toying with - living in New York City it is active but has not found (or can't find because of the buildings) a satellite signal.

I am yet to test it indoor low light/party mode.I liked smart mode feature the most. Alaid I tested Wi-Fi in this s9500 and it works superb. U can view and take pictures wireless. Some people had problems with Wi-Fi bit I m able to do it.Cons: sometimes camera throws weird sound in few modes which one may not b able to hear since it it's v low. Also pop-up flash is at incorrect position, u always keep ur finger on it while clicking the snap.Update 09/06/2013I took Coolpix S9500 camera to my summer holidays and very happy with that. I was able to take more than 300 shots in 1 day with the battery still showing more than 50%. (GPS and WIFI off, No videos). Never ran out of battery issue.It takes 2-3 seconds to focus when u r using full zoom but that was fine with me. But the quality of zoom photos was fantastic, no complaints.Also low light shots are clear especially images captured in museums r good.Initially I have to try different modes/flash on-off to get correct image quality. But imagas r good at the end.

Having said that, the Nikon s9500 has exceeded my expectations. I've owned it for several months, more than enough time to expose any manufacturing defects. I've had no problems. The zoom, one of the main reasons I bought it, allows me get the shots I need. I take mainly outdoor photos, and in my opinion it works great in low light. I never use the flash, have it disabled.As for the setup, I had it up and running in a matter of minutes. Not much information in the quick start guide, but even for a beginner its easy. My only complaint is about the wifi. You would think they would include a few setup instructions for it and the mobile app you need. Nothing that I could find. I had to go to YouTube to figure it out, but once I saw the video it was easy. As for how the wifi works I've had zero problems transferring pictures to my phone. A minor complaint, and one I don't understand, is why edited images will not transfer over wifi.As for video it looks beautiful on the camera and my computer, however it doesn't look as good when uploading it to Facebook, again I don't know why. Maybe someone else can answer that.My final conclusion is this is a great little camera. A few minor complaints aside, I'm very happy with it.Update: I mentioned in my review that videos uploaded directly to Facebook did not look as good as they did on the camera or my computer.

At first we thought that we were doing something wrong, but after several hours of searching, I finally found an honest review on a photography website that described the camera as \"a great smartphone accessory\". We did not pay several hundred dollars for a Smartphone accessory. Not as convenient as we thought, and we are very disappointed in the blatant false advertising by Nikon.Besides this function (which was the sole reason we bought this camera), the camera works fine and is very light weight and well designed.

We wanted a new camera that was just as good, but with WiFi and GPS.  We were happy to see Nikon had added these features.  To start with, the camera takes great pix as did its predecessor. Good in low light and great for zoom.  Small enough to fit in a suit or jacket pocket so we could take it to dinners and theater when we didn't want our big camera around.  The GPS works quite nicely although they indicate you have to turn it off manually as it continues to run even when the camera is off, using up battery.  You would think they could do this automatically.  With the WiFi service it does shut off when the camera is turned off.  You download free software for your phone/iPad and it connects to the camera.  This works just fine, but it's not what I thought we were getting.  We were hoping it connected via WiFi directly to the internet and could upload our pix either to the cloud or select photos directly to Facebook, etc.  The new Samsung Galaxy cameras do this.  This really is just a transfer utility moving pix from the camera to your phone or iPad via WiFi.  From there you can upload them the usual way. And it uses WiFi for this near-field type communication instead of Bluetooth. I'm not sure why as an application of this type could easily be done by Bluetooth.  When the iPad/Phone connects to the camera via WiFi your internet connection via WiFi is terminated. Once you disconnect the camera you then need to reconnect your Internet WiFi. While this is a step in the right direction for Nikon, it's not far enough to compete with Samsung in this regard.

Or, it just won't take a picture anyway. I missed a lot of candid shots because of these issues. When you're taking videos and zoom, the motor is slightly audible. If you have the full-time motion control on during a video, it's constantly clicking which you can hear in the videos.I went through three of these in a row. The first, after a day or two, already had dust in the lens enclosure (why I sold my previous camera, a Panasonic ZS7). The second had hardware problems; the flash didn't feel solid as it sort of 'squished' back into the case and didn't always lock. The third I had for a while on a vacation, and the aforementioned problems happened (freezing, crashing, etc). I'm taking this back and maybe trying out the SX280. GPS is a feature I really like and that narrows my options down severely.It seems like all of these problems could be resolved with a firmware flash, but it doesn't seem that Nikon wants to address it so I'll be returning camera number three (the first already had a speck of dust in the enclosure, and with the second, the flash mechanism didn't lock back in place).", "Date": "July 16, 2013"}, {"Title": "Image quality great, audio needs a redesign", "Author": "Mandy", "ReviewID": "R182YNLGY06XKQ", "Overall": "3.0", "Content": "I recently got this camera for a concert I was attending (Mumford and Sons).

It did take me a while to figure out what setting worked best, and I do think I could he gotten a lot more shots if it fired faster.  Also, when the band ws moving, forget it - all shots were blurry.  When the flash pops up, it is awkward, and kind of cheap feeling.

I've dropped Canons and Panasonics a hundred times, observing big dents in the lens barrels and bodies, yet they still worked OK. The Nikon S9500 didn't have a scratch on it, yet malfunctioned anyway. I've heard about this problem with other users, but was surprise at how fragile this camera is. I sent it back to Nikon and they want $150 USD to fix it, so I will have to absorb the $350 loss and let them keep it (no point in paying to fix something that fragile that will just break again).Startup time for the S9500 is about one second, and going from minimum zoom to maximum zoom takes about two seconds. Image quality is OK for a camera with a 1/2.33-type sensor, but certain details like hair, or a bird's feathers in a low-contrast part of the bird's body may be smeared somewhat. This is apparently caused by the noise reduction software in the camera, which can't be turned down or off. Pocket cameras that have much larger sensors (and consequently much less zoom) can often produce a better image with less noise, but you have to give up the long zoom, or put up with a much larger camera.Using the S9500 is easy enough, since the menus and controls are pretty well common to most pocket cameras these days. I especially like the separate video button, which has saved me from a lot of missed opportunities. There are a few nitpicks I have with the S9500: I would like to have Spot Focus as an option on the menu, and I would like to have the option to adjust the amount of noise reduction, in case I wanted to do noise reduction on the computer with extra software.Shooting still photos are not much of a problem in good light, because the shutter speed will be high enough and the image stabilizer will help out. If you use a tripod, or place the camera on a solid object so that there is no camera movement at all, you have to remember to turn the image stabilizer off or the images taken will not be sharp and clear. Many of the comments I've seen about blurry images on this type of camera could be due to using the camera on a tripod or placing it on a firm surface, and forgetting to turn the image stabilizer off. Then of course, you have to remember to turn it back on.The S9500's long 550mm effective zoom (focal length) is the key feature here, and even very expensive cameras cannot match the S9500's image quality with subjects such as small birds at a distance, unless those expensive cameras also have a long focal length lens - nearly as long as the S9500 in any case. Where the S9500 differs most from expensive cameras with large sensors (DSLRs mostly) is in wide angle photos, where the lens is zoomed all the way out (i.e. 25mm effective focal length, with the zoom lever pushed toward the 'W' position). Wide angle photos of landscapes, especially with foliage, will show a great deal of smearing. Wide angle photos of large groups of people will show smearing and digital 'Artifacts' on people's faces when the image is viewed at full size on a computer or printed. A camera such as the Nikon Coolpix 'A' will do a much better job with wide angle photos because its sensor is about 15 times larger.Battery life with the S9500 is rated about average for a pocket camera, which I find is good enough for about three hours of use in the local parks, shooting 100 to 300 photos. How many photos you get on a battery charge depends on how many you shoot close together. If you have the camera on most of the time and keep it activated, and take very few shots, the battery will still run down in a few hours due to the LCD screen, to the image stabilizer, and other electronic features that are active when the camera is active. If you don't want to run out of power when you're out shooting photos, you should get a second battery (never, ever get anything except a genuine Nikon battery) and make sure both are charged up before heading out.", "Date": "March 18, 2013"}, {"Title": "LOVE this camera!!", "Author": "Hilary", "ReviewID": "RTF07AO4SAVWI", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I was looking for a nice point and shoot camera that has the high quality of a larger camera, but is small enough to fit in my clutch or pocket.

That sounded crazy to me. I tried to find some info via various google searches, but all I found were complaints about this same issue. Don't buy this if you are planning to use the video option.", "Date": "August 19, 2013"}, {"Title": "Don't order the package deal", "Author": "Dave", "ReviewID": "RDS7ZBS6LYO6K", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I bought two of these cameras after being a long-time user of the S600.  I love it, hence the 5 stars.  However, I also bought the recommended Case Logic TBC-302 FFP Compact Camera Case (Black) that was part of a deal.  Beware, the camera doesn't fit this case.

But I've found a few things that concern me as well. (1) The auto-focus doesn't work very well when taking close-ups. Even when my subject is well-lit and has good detail in the auto-focus area, I watch as the camera runs right through the proper focus and gives up. It's frustrating, and there's no option to focus manually. (2) When the sepia effect is selected, the camera will not focus on anything, at any range. It seems to pause at the proper focus point when pressing the shutter button half-way, but then jumps out of focus. I suspect that the 'soft' effect is being applied, but when it shouldn't be. But there is a work-around: just shoot in color or black and white, and then apply the sepia effect. (3) The battery icon only has two levels: full and nearly depleted. I was initially impressed by how long the battery seemed to be lasting until I saw the icon change after less than 100 shots. It takes several hours to recharge in the camera. The S9500 has some great features, but they could have picked some more useful ones than 'shrink face' and 'enlarge eyes' (why would anyone want to use those?!), like blur background and manual focus. All-in-all, I'm impressed with the camera so far. It's a giant leap from my CoolPix 3700, if that's saying anything.Update:After using the camera for several weeks, I'm still happy with the picture quality, but auto-focus requires a LOT of light. It's really frustrating trying to use the camera indoors, even with good room lighting, and constantly getting the red brackets, meaning that it's not able to focus. If you plan on taking many indoor pictures, I'd strongly recommend against this camera.Another gripe is that the self-timer has only two settings: 2 and 10 seconds. What good is the shorter interval? Who can sprint fast enough to make that useful? It should be at least 5 seconds.", "Date": "May 27, 2013"}, {"Title": "OK camera but with problems", "Author": "Robert Chance", "ReviewID": "R4499KLBW3H94", "Overall": "3.0", "Content": "This camera has a few problems.

The Sony was spot on amazing for such, especialy on just the default AUTO settings.  This camera, not at all.  90% of the pics are blurry.  especially if using ANY zoom.  I can stand perfectly still, allow it to focus, get the green box showing focused, and it will take a blurry picture almost gauranteed.  Never have i had that on a camera.  shooting video in soft or lower light (say the living room with one lamp on) turns out pretty dim also.  Other than those, the camera would be great... unfortunately for me and how i use the camera, its a deal breaker and i'm getting rid of it and going to go back to my Sony.
