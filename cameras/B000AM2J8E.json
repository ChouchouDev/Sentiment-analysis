{"Reviews": [{"Title": "Not worth spending your money on this unit", "Author": "Michel Chriqui", "ReviewID": "R1PR2BO2CK78R8", "Overall": "2.0", "Content": "I purchased this DVR at Frys Electronic in August 2005. It worked just a little over a year, then just died.The PC application design is not user friendly. The user manual is poorly written. For some reason it is not possible to go to a specific date and time to review a recording... the feature while present in the software, didn't work. This defeats the purpose of 24x7 recording of motion triggered events.Overall the DVR 4-Net seemed to be an un-finished product, Swann needs to work out the kinks.Also I wished the product allowed the user to upgrade it's software. You are basically stuck with the software that was flashed during manufacture (not an issue if it worked properly).I would not recommend purchasing this device.", "Date": "December 10, 2006"}], "ProductInfo": {"Price": "$699.95", "Features": "Monitor up to 4 cameras simutaneously\nAccess your PC at work, home or on vacation, to monitor your office, warehouse, house, car park & more\nGlobal web access - you see what your cameras see\nMotion detection with instant email notification - sends you a picture of the movement seen by each camera\nPlug & play software with easy to follow user manual", "Name": "Swann DVR 4-Net Digital Video Recorder", "ImgURL": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/31YGXH3M78L._SX300_.jpg", "ProductID": "B000AM2J8E"}}
