Took it in the pool once, then on a short snorkel trip during which it took beautiful pictures.  I never opened the ports or battery case during this time.  On a second foray into the ocean the buttons onthe camera stopped working. I could not adjust the settings or zoom.  Forced to return and I hope I get my money back!", "Date": "December 11, 2013"}, {"Title": "waterproof?", "Author": "Doug", "ReviewID": "R1L180TVMD8IZA", "Overall": "1.0", "Content": "I took it in 5 ft of water and it would not come on.  I got out, double checked the locks, everything was locked.  When I opened the camera to get the SD card out,  I got a lot of water also.  Very disappointed.  Lets see if Olympus replaces it.", "Date": "July 22, 2013"}], "ProductInfo": {"Price": null, "Features": null, "Name": null, "ImgURL": null, "ProductID": "B00BJO4ZL6"}}
