It is not a polyvalent camera for every situation - it is poor at fast action shots and moving targets - but if you are doing anything else the colours and the sharpness are simply stunning. It takes a while to get used to and you need to invest some time in understanding how it works but the dividends are well worth it. I would thoroughly recommed this camera to anyone who is interested in photography.", "Date": "December 14, 2013"}], "ProductInfo": {"Price": "$1,589.00", "Features": null, "Name": "Fujifilm X-Pro 1 16MP Digital Camera with 35mm F1.4 Lens", "ImgURL": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/51NVChACVLL._SY300_.jpg", "ProductID": "B00AC7GMOO"}}
