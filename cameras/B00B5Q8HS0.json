It keeps showing a \"card Error\" whenever it gets near nature. Repeatedly works around the house, saves the video, plays back no problems.  Get it up on the mountain and BOOM!  Death to recording. \"Card Error\" is it's favorite game.  Nothing wrong with the card.  Works fine everywhere else.  Its a Gen10 16GB memory card.
