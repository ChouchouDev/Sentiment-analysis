For us,  this has all what we need in a camera as well as the price.", "Date": "October 2, 2013"}, {"Title": "Great Camera", "Author": "Hall \"2528\"", "ReviewID": "R1W3YU729LMUUV", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I bought this as a gift for my daughter and she loves it.

Here are three reasons why:1) Within the first year the zoom lever broke.2) The lens sometimes sticks in the \"macro\" position.3) Worst of all, when I turn the camera off and then go to use it the next day, the battery is completely drained.This piece of excrement is flawed beyond redemption. When I get a new camera I'm going to chuck the Fuji as far as I can throw it, and watch with glee when it smashes to the ground. Hate, hate, hate this camera.Signed,Hater", "Date": "October 2, 2013"}], "ProductInfo": {"Price": "$99.95", "Features": "3.0-inch TFT color LCD monitor\n16 million effective pixels 1/2.3-inch CCD image sensor with primary color filter\nFujinon 5x optical zoom lens with approx. 7.2x digital zoom\nFocal Length: f/4.6mm-23mm; Full Aperture: f/3.5 (Wide), f/6.3 / f/15 (Telephoto)\nHD movie (1280 x 720p/30fps)", "Name": "Fujifilm FinePix JX680 16 MP Digital Camera with 3-Inch LCD (Red)", "ImgURL": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/51BxbKZjp3L._SY300_.jpg", "ProductID": "B00B5MUJKI"}}
