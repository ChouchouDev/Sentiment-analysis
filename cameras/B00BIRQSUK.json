BEWARE OF FOCUS CAMERA.this camera worked for about 30 days then would not come on no matter what. Called Sony and their tech support and after 30 mins they said its defective and is a 1 year parts and labor and to send it back. Amazon sent me a rma in about 10 minuets and at my cost I sent it back to FOCUS CAMERA. who then promptly sent the defective camera back and said they don't take reterns or warranty items. Amazon also couldn't get them to do anything. So I am stuck over 200 in the hole. Will try now Sony direct again.  And to make matters worse FOCUS (CRAPPY) CAMERA now spams me abot 3 times a day to buy more of there sub par service crap.BE AWARE OF FOCUS CAMERA  no custermer support.........
