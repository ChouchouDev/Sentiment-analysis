{"Reviews": [{"Title": "great pocket-sized point and shoot", "Author": "Jim", "ReviewID": "R24WWRLCPWEAJ8", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "Love this camera!  Takes great low-light photos (with or without flash) and has some great features.  Took it out golfing the other day and using continuous shutter mode it actually caught full swings frame-by-frame.  Very high quality pics too, when I uploaded them to the computer you could make out tiny details in a big picture - like the logo on my golf ball!  In addition, they dual purposed the gyro sensor in the camera that helps stop blur t so you that while reviewing series of shots you can tilt the camera to cycle through them making almost a miniature movie of your pics.Panorama works well and is super easy - no pausing in between frames, just keep moving the camera.  Love the full 16:9 aspect ratio of photos as well.  Wifi works great too - very cool and easy to send the pics right to your smartphone (which lets face it, is where most of us keep our photos now) for storage and uploading to sites like facebook.It is really small though which makes it great for putting in your pocket or taking it out with you, but also makes the buttons a little close together.  Takes a little getting used to.When purchasing this camera it came down to this and the Elph 130.  I liked the buttons and simpler of the layout of the Elph better, but I think I made the right choice with the wx80 - full hd videos, excellent low-light capabilities, panorama and a faster frame rate.  Plus it charges by micro-USB without having to take the battery out of the camera - you can just use your phone charger.I've read some issues about battery life, but I haven't had any yet.  We took over 50 photos golfing in like 30 minutes and lost about a quarter power - and that's with a lot of screen time reviewing shots.  I purchased a bundle with an extra battery pack just in case though.I highly recommend this camera.  Sorry for the long review, but when I was debating between cameras there weren't a lot of good detailed reviews, so I thought I'd try and help out.", "Date": "May 3, 2013"}, {"Title": "Super tiny - almost too small - but big on features", "Author": "Yarii", "ReviewID": "R59E9PQQUSYP4", "Overall": "3.0", "Content": "NOTE: I ended up returning this camera. It was a little too tiny for my liking, and I also had an issue of it losing my password on occasion.A couple years ago I tried a Canon Elph -- this camera is similar in size, so if you have large fingers, you may have trouble using the controls. It's so small, Sony went back to a smaller 2.7\" LCD screen when they've been using 3\" screens on most of their latest cameras.There is no control mode knob on top. Everything is set via menus, however there is a dedicated Movie Button.No touchscreen. I knew it didn't have one, but some web sites like Snapsort, where you compare various camera models, are saying this DOES have a touchscreen. That is incorrect.The Menu Button is no longer a round easy-to-push button, it almost looks like a rocker switch with the Help/Delete button right below, as best I can tell they are separate, but touching, buttons. The Menu Button is hard to push without touching the Control Wheel, and vice-versa.  Especially so if you have short fingernails. You almost need a stylus, not kidding!This camera is made in China. I have other Sony cameras also made in China and I've had no problems with them; I think part of my problem with this camera is it's so tiny and feels more fragile than the others - such as this one, one of my favorites but much larger/heavier and harder to carry in a small bag: Sony Cyber-shot DSC-HX10V 18.2 MP Exmor R CMOS Digital Camera with 16x Optical Zoom and 3.0-inch LCD (Red) (2012 Model).I started to return this when I thought Sony had included the wrong size micro USB. Well, stupid me! I was trying to insert it into the bottom of the camera where the HDMI cable goes because I hadn't noticed the small door on the side. The charging hook-up is behind one of those rubber flap doors on the left side of the camera (as you are facing the lens). I hate those rubbery doors as they easily break off after using them for awhile, so I will buy a separate battery charger.The battery charges inside the camera via the micro USB cable and the AC adapter which are both included. Not a big deal as most all new cameras come this way now,  the manufacturer saves money since they don't have to provide a separate charger. You can also charge it without the AC adapter, by plugging it into your PC, but that will take longer.I've finished with the \"Cons\"! Let's move on to the good things.Super-fast at start-up, focusing, and processing to take the next photo, due to the Bionz processor.Decent pictures, especially outdoors, but most cameras are this way - I am not a pixel peeper but you shouldn't be with a camera like this. To a normal person, the photos this produces are fine. Although these photos aren't as good as what I get from my Sony HX10V, but it costs a lot more and it's a larger camera (see link to that camera above).Superb movies! Sony amazes me with their ability to make cameras where the videos are so much better than others.Battery Life: Some complain, I think it's pretty good. I have taken over 150 photos and 10 movies since I got it and the battery symbol is at 1/2 remaining.8X optical zoom, not as much as other cameras, but even if you use the Clear Image Zoom (digital but better than most) you can go out to 16X zoom.16 MP - this is still a little high, but I'll take it over a 20 MP camera with a small sensor.Wi-Fi - If your router has a WPS Push Button it's easy-peasy to set up (my Cisco Valet has the WPS button, but I'm not sure if other routers have this button as my only router experience is with Valets). After you have the PlayMemories software installed, you have to \"one-time\" connect the camera to your PC and set up the SSID/password. If you have the WPS Push Button, you press your router button first, then get into the menu on the camera and press Wi-Fi Push. It takes a few minutes to completely connect, but once you've done that, you're good to go. It also takes a long time to transfer photos. If you don't have the WPS Push button on your router, you have to enter everything manually like a keyboard on your LCD screen. You can also use your SmartPhone as a remote control to take photos but I haven't tried that yet.Special effects:  Love the watercolor and illustration effects, which you apply in the playback menu, and it also saves your original photo.EASY setting - perfect for older people who want limited choices and feel overwhelmed with a digital camera.Conclusion: If you are looking for a tiny camera that you won't even notice if it's in your pocket, this is a good choice...but don't expect the Wi-fi to work perfectly and grow your nails longer for the tiny buttons.", "Date": "May 14, 2013"}, {"Title": "Easy but Powerful", "Author": "Sergio Zavarce", "ReviewID": "R2ODRSBL4GBMYP", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "Its a great package since it has so many features in a very light and small camera. Zoom and focus work great, panoramic pictures are very easy to take.I bought it because I always wanted a good point and shoot for low light situations, and since it was one of the features advertised I wanted to give it a try, and I am very satisfied with them. Low light pictures are very good, even when you do not use the flash, can still get a good picture at night, with not so much light around.My only complains would be that it does not come with a separated battery charger (but it is optional), and the HDMI cable is not provided.

Here's a rundown after my first week...", "Author": "E. Tucker", "ReviewID": "R237SUYEBDLDOT", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "This is Sony's new Cybershot for 2013.  It is a very powerful and compact device and after using it for a week it performs much better than my older Sony model in overall speed and low light conditions.  This is due to the upgraded processor and the upgraded Exmor R sensor.  This new model has an 8x zoom which is an upgrade from the 5x of the previous model which is a welcome addition.  One of the newer more cutting edge features is the built in wifi.  This lets you transfer pictures to your computer, your iOS or android device, or use your iOS or android device to remotely take pictures and it works flawlessly.  Another fun feature are the \"Beauty Effects\" which are built into the camera. They include skin tone changing, eye widening, and teeth whitening.  These aren't only easy to use, but they actually work surprisingly well.If you are looking to upgrade your camera and $200 is your pricepoint; the WX80 is a great choice for a full featured point and shoot for 2013.If you wanted a bit more zoom (20x), a slightly bigger screen, and a bit more megapixels (18MP) your next option is the April release Sony seen here.http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00BEHQKPW/ref=as_li_ss_tl?ie=UTF8&camp;=1789&creative;=390957&creativeASIN;=B00BEHQKPW&linkCode;=as2&tag;=stupisms-20Of course, when you're ready for the big leagues it's time for the RX1 which was voted the best camera of 2012 by many enthusiasts.http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0097CXFCC/ref=as_li_ss_tl?ie=UTF8&camp;=1789&creative;=390957&creativeASIN;=B0097CXFCC&linkCode;=as2&tag;=stupisms-20", "Date": "March 26, 2013"}, {"Title": "Ahhh yes!", "Author": "Kat", "ReviewID": "R2XQY2J1DY8ESE", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I chose 5 stars because it really takes such lovely pictures, even just on the automatic setting.

The flash is powerful, but doesn't wash anything out. The backlighting feature that it is so well known for is also incredibly good, I can take pictures in such a dark room without flash but still don't need to brighten the picture later. I haven't had a camera before that didn't need that.

But I am going to here since there are a number of lengthy reviews and if you want my bottom-line here it is. Sony created a remarkable high performing point and shoot in a very small and relatively light weight body with fantastic battery life. The most outstanding features to me are the very fast shutter and autofocus (rivaling DSLRs), vibrant and accurate color reproduction, good Wifi and smart phone control, and astounding low-light performance. Where the camera falls a little short is with background defocus  and very good but not great video performance.

Easy to use with amazing quality in both high and low light situations.  I often turned off the flash indoors and got beautiful pictures with a lot more character than if I'd used the flash.  The cameras small size is both a blessing and a curse.  Very easy to slip into any pocket.  However, if you have very large hands as I do, you'll find yourself accidentally changing settings on the very sensitive control wheel. Getting better with practice, but I never had to worry about that with the slightly larger Canon this one replaced.  The viewing screen on the back of the camera is amazingly clear and accurate.

When battery died after 30 minutes of use, I thought I had a dud, but apparently this is how long the battery is supposed to last for ordinary shooting (according to the manual).  I can't believe Sony engineers ignored this.  It makes the camera a novelty item, rather than a viable camera (maybe the idea is you bring this AND a camera with a normally functioning battery?).  I don't get it.  There's no workaround either.  You can't plug it into an external power supply.  When a USB cable is attached, all functions are disabled except browsing, and unlike the Handycam-line, there aren't other battery sizes to attach.

I purchased a spare OEM Sony battery and charger also including the silicone rubber case. Please spend the extra couple of dollars for the sony battery, yes you can buy aftermarket cheaper, but read the reviews do you really want your battery to not hold a charge, melt, ruin your camera or catch fire?  The other reason I would recommend a spare battery is the usb charging is fine, but the little door cover for the usb plug does not seem well engineered and the silicone cover has to be removed if you want to charge it that way. This is something they should have realized, extra steps, it's a pain actually. With the spare battery you only have to pull down one side of the silicone case to pop in a new battery much quicker and easier. The camera is apower house with all its features, truly amazing, wifi, wifi to tablet, phone, or tv to view pictures is pretty cool. The HD video is awsome for this little thing but, yes there is a but! If you are running updated software and the latest hardware you will be fine to view video in 1080p on your pc with play memories software. (You have to download seperately, no disc) if you do not have the latest and greatest and want to play video on an old system 5 years or more with lower than recommended hardware, play back will not be smooth and will skip and jump. The solution is to record in standard SD to eliminate the stutter and skipping. We took hundreds of pictures during our Floriday trip and really gave it a workout at Bushgardens. The zoom was very good and the pictures did not come out blurry like my last camera during motion events, which was my primary complaint with my last camera and one of the reasons I bought this.

It is the perfect bridge camera for me.  But I have been searching ---- forever --- for that tiny camera that does well (not perfect --- come on, let's get real) in low light.  This is it!I do not own a DSLR so when reviewers talk about how they wish there was RAW capabilities, I kind of tune out.  I am that amateur who just loves to take a good picture, using macro, or one in low light, or zooming in on my neighbor's flowers and having it look like a magazine photo (though not enlarged to show any potential flaws).I struggled to get the wi-fi going; had to call Sony customer chat room; 1 hour --- I couldn't find enough info in the manual nor the play memories download to explain how to get wifi going to send pics from the Sony WX80 to my Iphone 4S.  (Maybe the readers are smarter than me.)Some tips (I hope I remember the all the steps):  Download play memories to both Smart phone as an ap and PC computer (for wi-fi capability to both), Go to Camera and go to the icon that looks like a suitcase which is shooting settings.  Move down to WPS push and sync with your wi fi.  You will have to enter your I Phone Password.  Then make sure under Iphone Settings - you show wireless as on and a new WiFi choice.  When you want to send a pic to your Iphone; you hit playback, Wifi, select Image (or images), then go to your iphone and make sure right wireless address is chosen (under Iphone settings wifi) and also make sure you open play memory ap and choose connect. THEN it works.After walking me through this; then the SONY Customer Service sent me this link which I had not found on my own:http://support.d-imaging.sony.co.jp/www/disoft/int/playmemories-home/operation/import/wi-fi-cyber-shot.htmlAs long as I use it occasionally, I should remember that there's three parts to downloading - send from camera, click the right wi-fi choice on your phone and then open playmemory ap on phone to connect.

I chose to stay with Sony because I never had any issues with my older camera and I like how the controls are set up so I didn't have to relearn how to take pictures before going on vacation. The camera is great - very quick start up to capture time, great detailing in pictures, and little to no blur on most shots. I decided to finally get a new camera because of the slightly greater zoom and the CMOS processor that's supposed to be better in low light and a little steadier than older processors. I can't say I've had any trouble learning features or taking great pictures (even through screen windows, at night!), however I still don't have consistently great pictures in low light and some of my low light pics are tinted either yellow or purple - a draw back that I experienced with my other cybershot as well.

It's even smaller than my phone!!  My phone isn't huge by any means, but the camera is a bit smaller than that.  The camera itself has MANY 'Scene Modes' to choose from.  From Anti-Blur to Night-Scene to High-Sensitivity... It has practically every basic mode there is to use with a small point-and-shoot camera.  I personally love the Anti-Blur Mode on the camera, since my hand is normally VERY jerky, resulting in blurry photos.  And the Anti-Blur is just what I needed.  My boyfriend has VERY sensitive eyes.  Whenever I use the Flash on the camera, he's always squinting or has his eyes closed.  So the Anti-Blur Mode will help take No-Flash photos with Anti-Blur, of my boyfriend and myself, so the photos will come out beautiful every time!  But it also does great capturing sunsets, nature, items you're trying to sell online... It's a great camera for everything.  Sure, the camera isn't going to replace your DSLR cameras out there, since those are professional quality cameras, and this is just a small camera for basic stuff.  But the photos still come out beautiful.  I've always been a fan of Sony products.  I've never had a problem with ANY of their products before.  And this is no different.  As for those of you that love to take videos of your children, pets, or whatever, this camera even has an Anti-Blur Mode for videos!  Which is great for those videos where there's a lot of movement in!My old camera was a Canon PowerShot A2300 camera.  It was a 16MP camera with a 5X Optical Zoom, but it didn't have a Mode for Anti-Blur, nor did it have any sort of Image Stabilization.  So whenever I took photos without the Flash on, the photos would ALWAYS be blurry.  Even though my Canon camera was a 16MP, and the Sony camera is a 16.2MP, the Sony camera takes MUCH better photos with and without the Flash.  I'm sure that .2MP doesn't make much of a difference, but I think the Carl Zeiss lens on the Sony camera definitely helps boost the image quality.  Which is WONDERFUL.It is a bit weird how you go about charging the camera battery, though.  Most companies include a charger that has a slot to stick your battery in, then you plug it into a wall socket.  Even older Sony cameras used this method.  For this camera, you plug the charger into a wall outlet and connect the USB cable from the charger to the camera.  And it basically charges the battery INSIDE of the camera.  Kind of reminds me of the mp3 and mp4 players that they make nowadays, where you have to plug them in to charge them.All in all, this camera is GREAT!!I'm not sure why so many people are rating this camera 1 star, due to the packaging and the delivery.

This camera is easy to take with me than any smart phone and takes photos that are in a completely different league.", "Date": "September 11, 2013"}, {"Title": "Decent point and shoot", "Author": "deirdrebardowl", "ReviewID": "R262P1RTVFX2TG", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "I lost the charger for my little w560 and after looking around a bit I was surprised to find out that Sony makes point and shoots with CMOS sensors for around 150 bucks.  That intrigued me and even though my trusty w560 is still in perfect working order besides for the charger, I decided to upgrade.  What I have discovered is that I need a point and shoot with the low light capabilities of this camera.It's really amazing to be able to take decent pics indoors without the windows open or using the flash.  This camera can do it.  This camera also has a host of neat little shooting modes and color options as well as being capable of HD video with stereo sound.  I have played with this camera for a week now and I'm still discovering new things buried in the menus.  I'm very happy with my 150 dollar purchase and it's worth every penny.Now for the cons.  The build of this camera is smaller than my w560 and feels more flimsy.  The smallness isn't a problem but coupled with the plastic feel it's a little bothersome as far as worrying about damaging the camera.  The shutter button is also another issue, at least on my camera.  The zoom function is tied into the shutter button and it will actually rattle if I shake the camera gently.  I thought I had broken my camera when I used the zoom function the first time, it moves around and isn't seated firmly at all.  It doesn't seem very stout and able to put up with much use.  The screen is smaller than I imagined which is just a nit-pick.The anti-shake technology also isn't everything the company preaches it is.  In low light it does much better than a normal camera however hand shake is an issue.  I mean if you can hold as still as is humanly possible you can get some great shots but if your subject is moving or you are moving for any reason, the image isn't usable which I expected.  Even my Sony CMOS DSLR has issues with low light without using flash but the company shouldn't use the anti-shake in low light as a selling point making people believe something that isn't even possible with more professional products from this brand.Having said all that, this camera is still deserving of 4 stars.  Only the build and the bit of flamboyant marketing is questionable about this camera.  I am a firm believer in Sony as being more bang for the buck and this camera is not an exception.", "Date": "September 4, 2013"}, {"Title": "Great point and shoot camera!", "Author": "Bigdoggolfer8", "ReviewID": "R1IFZDRRVJGMK6", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "I recently bought this camera for a vacation as my old point and shoot camera's zoom control broke.

This is my third digital camera and I am very pleased.  My $400 Olympus Stylus 1200 went dead after a couple years, needed $200 to repair.  My Nikon Coolpix cost $90 but took blurry pictures.  This little Sony is the size of a deck of cards and takes super clear and sharp photos with its Carl Zeiss lens.  The battery life seems longer, too, than my other cameras.  Easy to switch to video. The surprise was the simple ease of this cameras WiFi and the quick usefulness of having my photos immediately on my tablet, a Sony Tablet S.  I own many Sony products and am very pleased with the quality of each.  This camera was a bargain.  I also bought the Wasabi 2 battery pack and charger, although this camera comes with a Sony battery for in-camera charging.  Also bought separately a high quality memory chip, a PNY 16GB, 90 MB/second transfer rate for fast repeat photos. This camera has a burst photos feature which I haven't tried.  There is a one to two second delay between photos when shooting stills normally or in telephoto.  The zoom is impressive for such a small camera.

The photos it took were pretty good.  Focus and low light capability were excellent.  Where this camera falls down is on smoothness of operation.  The menus are overly complicated and frustrating to change any of the settings.  It has a number of different 'mode' settings that you are supposed to translate into low-light settings etc.  Wouldn't it have been easier to just give me simple ability to manually set shutter speed as on high-end cameras.  Ironically, on 'complicated' high end cameras, shutter speed can be simply set from the knob at the top of the camera.  I gave up on trying to navigate the menu system and stuck with just turning the flash on and off and leaving everything else in auto.The buttons are tiny and a little clumsy when trying to quickly navigate the menus.  I read this from another reviewer before purchasing and thought that tiny buttons wouldn't bother me because my fingers are small.  It's the combination of Sony's goofy selector wheel, small on/off button and convoluted menu system make the camera a little frustrating to use for anything except the most basic pointing ans shooting.The lens does make a 'strained' sound when it's going in and out when you turn it on and off.  This doesn't fill me with confidence that the camera will be a long term performer.I did compare this to the similarly priced Canon Elph 330.  While the Elph does require you to remove the battery to recharge, the image quality is a little better on the Canon.  The Canon menu system is simple to navigate as a point of comparison and the operation of the lens is smooth as silk.  The Canon is also slightly larger.  I wound up returning the Sony in favor of the Canon.On the plus side, the camera is tiny.  One of the smallest I've found.  The USB charging is another big plus.

One can shoot lower resolution video at 1080p or 720p in mpeg4 files but i prefer to use the highest resolution. I am very happy with the video at all resolution settings. The optical image stabilization does a good job. Considering the size of the battery its life is great. No big surprise but the buttons are wee for one with big hands.Now for the minusesThe manual that comes with the camera is printed on news print and awful. Go on line and google DX80 users guild to get something truly useful.There is no included battery charger only a usb cable one can use to directly transfer data to a mac or pc and charge the battery. For some reason I have an old sony charger which works with this battery.The thing I like the least is you need a PC or Mac with the sony software to get the video data from your SD card into a computer. It seems to work fine once it is set up. When I put the SD card into my card reader or hook up the camera via usb it automatically uploads my data and put it into my pictures folder.
