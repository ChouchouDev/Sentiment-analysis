{"Reviews": [{"Title": "Sony camera", "Author": "someonetofind", "ReviewID": "R2LSS9M7SH8UYF", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "I wish that people had written a full review before I bought this camera, so I could have been a bit more prepared.  Let me just say first that I love this camera, but there are some good and bad sides to everything, I suppose, so I am going to list them since the only other five reviews have not touched on anything but how great the camera is for them.Pros:  Comes with everything you need, there is no guess work!!!!Has a wonderful zoom on it.  I got this camera just in time to capture my son in football practice, and it felt like I was really standing next to him.  I could even use the LCD to zoom in and watch, even if I wasn't taking pictures of him.The instructions for the camera are actually in the box, you don't have to read them online.Very easy installation of the software, that is all online, and even compatible with Windows 8.Tons of wonderful features for an amateur photographer to feel like they know what they are doing (namely ME!!!)  It is easy to find all of these features and start playing around with them so that you are familiar with them fairly quickly.Cons:  The weight of the camera is all lens, so it is very front heavy.  The rest of the camera is plastic.The flash has to manually be popped up with a small button before even the auto flash will work.  If you are anything like me, you might forget that when you really need it.The lens cap does not fit very securely.  It fell off while I was carrying the camera in it's case and I didn't know it.The screen protectors don't stick very well.  I put mine on there, fairly easy after you cut it, fit it to the screen, especially if you have other devices that you protect.  Mine fell off once I set the camera back down on the counter.  I didn't even get a chance to carry it around with the protector on (this is not a no sell for me, I have never protected the screens on any of my cameras, and have never scratched any of them).I hope this review really helps someone that was doing research like I was.", "Date": "September 19, 2013"}, {"Title": "Amazing", "Author": "N.

The zoom really sucks and is very rough and not a smooth auto focus. I just spent a few minutes trying to shoot some photos for ebay and this camera would just not focus properly. May I say again, I hate this camera, for a beginner it might be ok but for me it is a hunk of lens heavy plastic junk not worth $20. Because it is not balanced properly taking a great shot consistently just wont happen unless you tripod it.I went back to using my old 10 year old sony because this camera is so bad.If you have an older sony cyber shot and are looking to replace it with another sony then forget about it, sony does not care judging by this model. Go with a camera made from an actual camera maker and not jack of all junk Sony.", "Date": "September 23, 2013"}, {"Title": "good deal", "Author": "Larry sterzing", "ReviewID": "R37SRAKRDOB2NT", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "This camera takes amazing pictures and is super easy to use!
