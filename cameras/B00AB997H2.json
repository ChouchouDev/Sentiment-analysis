The DL is heavy (20.x mb) but it is a 'real world' picture, not a professionally produced image.[...]Of note:  This camera goes through batteries like there is no tomorrow compared to the D300.  There are generic batteries that do the job a well as the Nikon's so spare some $$$ and get two of these and still have $ to have a cafe while waiting for CS6 to work it's magic on a large panorama using RAW images (126 shots).I am just wondering why I waited so long to switch...  Not that I will wait just as long for the next camera as I am always leery of glowing review w/o history (same for software)(of note I give it 5 stars but I do like the 'I love it' thingy I do not love objects, just peoples.", "Date": "March 29, 2013"}], "ProductInfo": {"Price": "$3,896.93", "Features": "The D800E is a specialized product designed with one thing in mind, pure definition: The D800E incorporates an optical low pass filter (OLPF) without anti-aliasing properties to facilitate the sharpest images possible and is a great option for RAW shooters\nExtreme resolution 36.3-megapixel FX-format (35.9 x 24.0mm) CMOS sensor: Large 4.88 pixels capture astonishing detail and subtleties with outstanding dynamic range for demanding wedding, landscape, fashion/commercial and video applications.\nFull 1080p HD broadcast quality video and minimized rolling shutter: Create true cinematic experiences using Full 1080p video at 30 or 24fps in H.264/MPEG-4 AVC format.
