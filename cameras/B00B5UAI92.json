{"Reviews": [{"Title": "Outstanding features for price", "Author": "W Stegner \"great writing fan\"", "ReviewID": "R1QD5RAILPSZL0", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I read many reviews of lower priced SLRs before settling on the Nikon d5200.  The 24 Megapixels, the 39 focus points, an excellent metering system and rear flip screen monitor were all features that sold me.  My photography is primarily aimed at family travel and events, with good to excellent quality output.  There are a lot of features that were only available on the high end models a few years ago. -  The lens has outstanding optics for a zoom.  And great versatility.", "Date": "July 14, 2013"}], "ProductInfo": {"Price": "$1,649.95", "Features": "KIT INCLUDES 10 PRODUCTS -- All BRAND NEW Items with all Manufacturer-supplied Accessories + Full USA Warranties:\n<1> Nikon D5200 Digital SLR Camera Body (Black) + <2> Nikon 18-300mm VR DX AF-S Lens +\n<3> Transcend 32GB Class10 SD Card + <4> Spare EN-EL14 Battery +\n<5> Vivitar 77mm UV Glass Filter + <6> ML-L3 Shutter Remote Control + <7> PD Laptop/Tablet DSLR Backpack +\n<8> PD 6pc Complete Cleaning Kit + <9> PD Memory Card Storage Wallet + <10> LCD Monitor Screen Protectors", "Name": "Nikon D5200 Digital SLR Camera Body (Black) with 18-300mm VR Zoom Lens + 32GB Card + Battery + Backpack Case + Filter + Accessory Kit", "ImgURL": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/51IE9dxegFL._SY300_.jpg", "ProductID": "B00B5UAI92"}}
