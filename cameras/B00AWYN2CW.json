It is a nifty piece of technology but a great photographic tool. Its small size and ease of use makes it a perfect pocket camera that you will actually carry in your pocket and take out and use!!. I am a professional photographer in New York and have bought several pocket cameras over the years in the hopes that I will carry and use the thing..Finally  I have found that camera. I have not been happier with a pocket camera and use it more often than I thought I would. I have to say the semi articulating screen is a definite plus allowing you to shoot from the hip or even lower. And the any way up allows you to shoot above your head and still view the screen. I would recommend this to any other photographer and even plan to buy a couple more as christmas gifts to family and friends.Canon PowerShot N 12.1 MP CMOS Digital Camera with 8x Optical Zoom and 28mm Wide-Angle Lens (Black)", "Date": "May 5, 2013"}, {"Title": "A Brilliant Concept Flawed by Networking", "Author": "Rick Grant", "ReviewID": "R3LSGDL4J0JUFM", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "I have been a Pro and Semi-Pro photographer for many years. Partly because of that experience, and partly because of the staggering advances we have seen in digital DSLR cameras, I was feeling that I had fossilized in my picture taking creativity.Although I have repented since, I was an early and loud fulminator against the whole idea of camera phones.  I also wrote off Instragram and others like it as abominations.Every day for about the last five years I have carried a pocketable camera of some sort, (mostly the Canon S95/100), when I wasn't carrying my large Nikons. I got good snapshots and sometimes photographic art but little of the excitement I used to feel doing what I can only call \"found photography\", or spur of the moment and random inspirations.Then I came across the PowerShot N. It is so quirky in its controls and features that I instantly found myself way beyond my photographic comfort zone. I started taking pictures at odd angles, (the tilt LCD is a big help here), I took them for no particular reason, I took a lot. The camera just begged to be used in weird and chaotic ways.I initially thought that the camera's quirkiest feature, which allows the camera to take not only the picture you wanted but then goes on to take 5 shots of its own using random color temperatures, filters, and zoom positions, was a useless marketers gadget. But that was conservative mindset so I forced myself to turn it on and experiment. Most of the time the random shots are pretty poor or uninteresting, but about ten percent of the time I find that the camera has found a perspective and image setting so far beyond what I would ever have thought of that it verged on brilliant.So, as a creative tool I cannot speak highly enough of the camera, but there are some things that bother me.I find myself accidentally triggering the touch screen and messing up either a menu setting or even preventing the camera from taking a shot.The shutter trigger areas on the front lens ring are a little too small for me and not prominent enough for reliable blind shooting.But the biggest problem is how Canon has implemented the camera's ability to network. Technically I suppose it is great but for the life of me I have never read such a confusing user manual. It suffers from the greatest sin in technical writing; referring the user to different pages during a procedure. So, you start to read about how to connect to lets say your home network; Step 2 might want you to jump 14 pages ahead to read about something. Then while there you might be sent back 5 pages before where you started and so on.The manual also commits the technical writing sin of never explaining why you have to do such and such, or what the effect of any options might be, or any explanation for why something may or may not work.I am pretty comfortable around networks but Canon's user manual is just a dog's breakfast.That said, I now have a superior camera linked to my smartphone (Nexus 4) so I do not have to use the very poor camera in the phone for Twitter, G+ etc.And I really do think this quirky little piece of experimental camera technology has really helped me to break out of my self imposed creative straitjacket.I like it a great deal for that.Rick GrantCalgary", "Date": "August 12, 2013"}, {"Title": "The camera is a hit!", "Author": "MeridianX", "ReviewID": "R3QJ18I7WEP2HE", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "Just received the camera....so far all I can say is that I purchased the white version and it is a gorgeous little camera! BUT please be aware to purchase a microSD card!  It doesn't mention this anywhere in the description so I need to get one before I can test out the camera...stay tuned...Update: May 5, 2013Camera takes pictures just as good as my Canon S90.  Totally different experience though...it is more like my iPhone.  Intuitive but requires being open to a camera that handles differently than any before it.  The camera is small and subsequently the buttons are small also.  Even though the buttons are small they are easy to hit and because of their location, do not get pressed accidentally. The touch screen works very well, only requiring a very light touch.  Being able to touch the screen to focus on the area you want to be in focus allows for very quick focus targeting.  Also, using the screen to sweep through the pictures is very convenient.  The zoom is very quick and the swing out screen is very handy.  The creative burst feature has been a favorite of my high school age daughter.  She has borrowed the camera quite a few times to take pictures and post them to her social accounts.  I found the slow motion video to be a addicting...there are two speeds to choose from...taking slow motion video of my son's golf swing allows us to see everything very clear and in very cool slow motion.  I have used it to capture my other children practicing gymnastics, bike riding and trampoline jumping...it gives us all a good laugh.  Most importantly, and the reason I bought the camera, is the wireless capability.  So far for me it has worked great.  If I want to post something or want to send a friend a picture I start up the CameraWindow app on my iPhone and I can view all the pics on the camera.  I then select what I want transferred to my iPhone.  The transfer has been quick and effortless.So far I have not explored all the capabilities of the camera but I can say I am very happy with the camera.  I have also had positive reaction and have shown the camera to a number of interested people who have seen me while using it public.  For the price it has exceeded my expectations.Update: May 10, 2013Still enjoying the camera!  I want to add some additional thoughts on this camera.  I have not altogether replaced my compact point & shoot with this camera.  This camera is for someone willing to try something unconventional and is not looking for a replacement for their S95 or G10.  It does not have the traditional manual functions of an enthusiasts camera but it has more capabilities than a camera phone (does use a similar sized flash however).  The camera is more of a curiosity that lends itself to the fun picture taking.  There is a dedicated button that allows you to shoot a quick succession of shots (some randomly of the background and not the subject!) and adds creative filters to them.  This is the type of customer that I believe Canon is focused on.  My teens love it and get a kick out of it when sometimes a stranger in the background shows up as the main subject of one of the random creative shots.  Also, if you do not want to upload your pics via WiFi to your phone then this probably isn't the camera for you. ... Just some thoughts if you are looking for a serious point & shoot camera to replace an old favorite...", "Date": "May 3, 2013"}, {"Title": "Love This Camera, Finally...", "Author": "michael d collier", "ReviewID": "R2PTDXOTSRVSGB", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "I've had this camera for about a month. I couldn't wait to get it, then I couldn't figure out what to do with it. It is such a departure from any camera I've ever used, it took a while to find a way to enjoy using it.First, the biggest thing is the form factor. How to hold it? I found that for your typical snapshot, opening the screen 45 degrees made for the best combination of holding the camera and seeing the shot. I also found that the ring shutter release is really awkward, especially if you wanted to use the touchscreen to select your focus point. It's much easier, especially with the screen at a slight angle, to touch where you want the focus and snap the shot at the same time. There is a setting to enable the touch to shoot option.Secondly, the next big thing is the WiFi feature. I've used Eye-Fi cards for years, and expected the same experience. Not so. Not nearly as automatic, but still pretty simple once you figure it out. First, press the WiFi button on the camera. It will start looking for an access point on your network, or, what I recommend, a smartphone. Next, on your phone, change the WiFi network to the name display on the LCD of the camera. Now you can select photographs on the camera and transfer them to an impressive number of websites.With these two revelations (for me), I've gone from \"why bother\" to \"hey, this is kinda cool\".Finally, the image quality is extremely good, much better than most P&S; cameras. The Depth of Field is even decent using the method I mentioned. I posted an image here so you can see what I'm talking about.So, if you're feeling a little adventuresome, this is a really well built camera that takes great pictures. The only drawback I see is if you are out with friends and want a stranger to take a picture for you.", "Date": "June 18, 2013"}, {"Title": "Mother's Day Gift", "Author": "lgb", "ReviewID": "R3AXRGA9C8XWQ2", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I purchased this camera with my gift card.

Perfect size for grab-and-go photos. The tilt display is a must for capturing photos from great creative angles. My #1 tip for interesting photos\u2014change the perspective\u2014don't just hold camera up to your face and shoot. For example, try holding the camera at or below your waiste and angle up. I think you'll find it more interesting than normal snapshots. This is why I am so excited about this little gem\u2014the tilt display alone makes it far superior to any camera phone on the market.The zoom ring, which is very old-school, is easy to control and has a very smooth action while shooting video. I've quickly adapted to the shutter ring\u2014but, if you aren't wild about it, just switch to touch screen shutter. For touch screen, hold your finger on screen, wait for in-focus beeps, lift finger and shutter releases.I have found myself cradling the camera in my left hand with my thumb resting on top of the zoom ring and my index finger wrapped around the bottom of the zoom ring\u2014easily controlling zoom with my thumb. I use my right hand for on-screen selections, shutter release, and added stability. This is very reminiscent of my days of using a SLR film camera.I have found the touch screen controls to be very intuitive, but, highly recommend taking the time to load the users guide and reading it to get the most out of this wonderfully designed little camera. I would love to see this ingenious design widely adopted for point and shoot cameras.The metal housing is beautiful and sturdy. I was happy to find that this model sold by Amazon included the neck strap and blue \"sleeve\" that is standard for the N FaceBook model. The little sleeve seems pointless, but I love the neck strap. Also happy with Amazon's service. My first PowerShot N had a serious scratch on the display screen. I braced myself for the hassle and expense of exchanging it. To my delight it was quick, easy, painless, and free. I just followed the exchange procedure and the damaged camera was picked up by UPS the next day (free to me) and the replacement was shipped immediately and arrived in about 4 days.", "Date": "February 16, 2014"}, {"Title": "Adorable", "Author": "mary  sanchez", "ReviewID": "R1PMCUP3TGKLGP", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "The title says it all.

Love it to pieces. It's a little strange coming off of a dslr to something like this but I adore it. I bought it because I needed an interesting light and compact point and shoot and really liked the originality of this camera. As far as the heavy weight people discuss on their reviews they are expecting because it is so small that it won't weigh anything, but Canon gave this little guy a full metal body. I am accepting of the weight, just because I know how sturdy this camera is. I have no issues with the screen only flipping 90 degrees, but then again I wasn't expecting it either. I also tried taking selfies and shot self video with no issues. So I don't really see why the screen flipping up is so important. I did use the screen for what Canon intended it for which was high, low and food photography and it was so much better than a standard non flip non swivel screen. The flash seems like a cell phone flash, but it's much more powerful and honestly much less fake looking than cell phone and camera flashes tend to be, which as I have noticed with all of my Canon cameras, seems to be a trend with their flashes. Battery life is a little short here though, but I'm just going to buy some backup batteries. I don't expect such a small camera to power an entire city over night like some people seem to.

The flip display and touch screen are good features. Zoom and shutter rings around the lens are cool.  Good zoom range (8x optical) with indication of optical and digital. Flip display and touch screen are useful features.Cons: Flip display moves only 90 degrees and not suitable for selfees.  My main complain is its user interface.  Despite the touch screen the navigation is very badly designed and has very poor usability. Many issues are annoying and some are painful. Even the printed \u2018Getting Started Guide\u2019 is poorly done.Multi-photo \u2018creative shots\u2019 feature is useless in my opinion. Very few people will use it and even then only a few times just to tryout. You have 5 pictures to delete every time you take a picture. A true multipicture feature would have been useful instead of camera deciding on parts of the scene to capture.  Strangely this apparently useless feature is selected with a dedicated hardware mode switch.  However, a useful feature such as slow-motion video is the last selection on the menu. Slow motion performance is nowhere near iPhone 5s. Very poor stabilization of videos and cannot recommend it for taking any videos.  Shutter ring and the zoom ring are very close and one may shutter inadvertently while trying to zoom.Nice leather looking long carry strap, only if you like to carry this tiny camera like a ladies handbag.Note that the camera does not come with any memory at all and you need to buy a micro SD separately before you can even try the camera.", "Date": "January 6, 2014"}, {"Title": "4 stars will most likely become 5!", "Author": "Alexandra Nash", "ReviewID": "RZJEZOXDDRIJ2", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "I just received this camera yesterday and took it for a test drive today.

Let me use my usual disclaimer, in the interest of fairness, and admit that many cameras by reputable makers (and there are many) deliver what they promise. It is more about what camera traits you are looking for. So, I would suggest to anyone looking to buy one to google 'camera trait search' and get the whole picture.The Canon N is a fixed lens camera (point and shoot, some would say), with 12.1 resolution (megapixels), and a x8 zoom. The sensor size is 1/2.3 inch CCD-type, which is standard for cameras of its class.It does not have a viewfinder, which, again, many in its class don't. The ISO rating, which is the gauge for how well it does in low light, is 6400. That rating is sufficient for most purposes. The video is a Full HD- that is 1980x1080 resolution. It does not have a hot shoe for an external flash option. That is not unexpected for its size and category. The LCD screen is a 461,000 resolution. The camera does not do RAW processing but you would need only if you did not want to be limited by JPEG type storage. The burst rate is a reasonable 2.3 frames persecond- great for quick shots. The weight of the camera is a convenient 195 grams.Canon N comes with WiFi, and the LCD is both tiltable and touch-screen.Overall, a fun, convenient camera.

While its small its quite heavy, like having a rock around your neck. Controls are very small, too small, and menus are not simple to use. Be wary.UPDATE: I have, in fact, made arrangement with Amazon to return the camera, the memory card and the charger with two spare batteries. It just is a difficult little bugger. As I stated, it has a beautiful design and is well built and quality like most Canon cameras, but it is far too small to safely handle in the field or indoors, it is too heavy -- that may be hard to believe but it is like a little brick if you have it on a strap around your neck, and the photos are NOT spectacular. I assume it might be \"cool\" for the Facebook, Instagram shoot-and-upload generation. If you are interested in the camera TRY to find it somewhere where you can handle and play with it before you buy. I see that now that the summer camera buying season is over Amazon is dropping the price. The last Canon I bought was in 2007, the Canon TX1, also an untraditional camera BUT great. I still have it and love it. But Canon never made a TX2 because users thought it was an odd shape etc., just like I feel about the N. I'd be surprised if there is an N2. Canon just brought out a Facebook Edition of the N with a button to upload to Facebook.

However, if you think you're going to connect to your computer and phone wirelessly as touted, get ready to get out the manuals and settle into hours of frustration with maze-like directions and no help. First, you must sign up for Canon Image Gateway, an experience that first requires registration of your N camera, which then fails to show up under your registered products once you enlist in the Gateway program, and you have to re-register the product all over again.Once I successfully joined Canon Image Gateway, I presumed an icon would appear on the camera (like the Twitter icon that did appear) so I could at least upload pictures to their website for later download, as promised. Uh-uh. You will also find - at least I did - that the Canon N only sometimes will join your network, telling you that your password is wrong, only to tell you next time that your password is fine, even though you haven't changed it. If you think you're going to send photos to your phone, in my case an iPhone, good luck. And I don't mean that sarcastically, because luckily, I did manage to connect to my phone once or twice for a nano-second before being disconnected with no explanation, except for the message \"disconnected.\" So far, I've never substantially connected to my phone (yes, I've downloaded their app), though I might one day.

Camera. Ever.

It also doesn't have a button on the top to take the picture like every other camera under the sun. You have to press down on the lens in a specific spot - the zoom is right on top so you have to be careful. It's something you can adapt to if you will never pass your camera off to another person - which isn't even close to realistic. Somehow this camera was listed on best travel cameras. It is small, so that is nice but there are other small cameras out there. The lack of standard photo settings and the need to give anyone who touches it a full tutorial makes it completely useless - especially for travel. Incredibly annoying.

The picture quality is pretty good and the camera itself feels very well made and is fun to use.  I seem to prefer the touch screen shutter function as opposed to using the shutter ring around the lens.  The only thing that could use some improvement is the WiFi connectivity to a your smart phone.  The initial setup can be a bit confusing and takes a little time to do.

I use a G 12 for my pocket camera, which is pocketable, but this thing grabbed my attention for its size. I ordered this camera hoping to be able to take better pictures in low light than my IPhone, which suffers when the subject is even moving slowly.  This camera falls way short for the price.  Indoors, it adjusts the ISO way too high for a decent looking picture while in auto.  While in P it adjusts the shutter way too slow with a lower ISO.  Is it better than my phone? nope.  There is a total lack of control to try to accomplish a decent shot in a tough situation.  Sorry, but this is where film still is a much more economically viable solution if you know what you are doing and actually care about your shots.  To each their own, but to me, film grain looks better than digital noise.  I was not looking for the moon, but I was hoping for better pictures out of this camera for the price.  Save your money and time by just using your phone for shots that you want to post up quickly and look at other options for cameras you want to use when you care about taking a bad shot.  I can tell you though, this camera does not function in lower light levels that most cameras I have used would.  The flash is very weak as well.  This camera would be saved in my opinion by the ability to select scene modes instead of only having the camera do it for you. It does not though...  Hate to say it, but this camera is a gimick and I fell for it.  There are better point and shoots that give you more features for actually taking the shot and at a third of the price.", "Date": "May 7, 2013"}, {"Title": "It caused a stir! :)", "Author": "Hellen White \"Folly\"", "ReviewID": "RB6UVH6F4RKYO", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "Got my camera just before a fantastic weekend away in the tropics, so it got quite a workout.

The one thing that irritates me is that if you touch it near the program icon it sometimes changes to the screen where you select what program you want.

I'm a fan of Ken Rockwell's blog and bought a Canon S100 based on his recommendation. While it's a great camera it is no where near as pocketable as my SD780 was. I've since been patiently waiting for a suitably small replacement. I saw an ad for the PowerShot N, read the reviews on Amazon and bought one same day. Upon opening the box, I was surprised and disappointed to see that the PowerShot N is about the same size as the S100 I was hoping it would replace. I'm sure it takes great pictures but I'm sending it back instead of bothering to find out. The Canon S100 already takes great pictures and I see no point in replacing it with another camera of the same size. The PowerShot N also feels slightly heavier than the S100. My ideal camera is one that I'll forget is even in my pocket.Just because it's not for me, that doesn't mean it isn't a wonderful camera. It's much smaller than any DSLR, \"pro-am\" or \"serious\" camera which means you're more likely to have it with you and use it. The body feels like tough metal construction.  I like everything about it except it's \"averge\" compact camera size.
