Bruce", "ReviewID": "R2HXUSMX3BRTHH", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I must say instead of purchasing from Amazon I couldn't wait and tested out cameras in Best Buy and was completely sold on this camera and paid $20 more +tax.  It feels a little on the cheap side?  Maybe just because it's light weight which I do like.  It was very easy to connect to security enabled wi-fi and send pictures to facebook and email.  Some things I believe require you to connect to a computer.  The camera is very intuitive and hints automatically pop up on the screen to further explain what a feature can help you with.  I have not picked up the manual yet.  As another reviewer said the flash is odd but works very well.  I think the way the flash is lends me to lean toward that cheap feeling because it seems as though it could be broken easily the way it is attached.  However, the camera detects if you open it and then will allow for auto flash when open or flash off if it's closed.I wondered how point and shoot cameras were going to keep up and this camera is an excellent example.  This camera is by far better than any cell phone just with the wide angle and zoom capabilities.  With the added sharing, touch screen, and intuitiveness that is integrated it makes it an very neat relatively compact device.  It's not as compact as some but way smaller than the larger zoom cameras and is a great compromise.I have seen a couple cameras with gps and I know one was powered by android.  Nice features but I did not see the benefit of having a lot of those features on my camera when I have them on my phone? Also, the price of that camera was significantly more.Also something to note.  This camera actually has a low light sensor that compensates for the light level versus detecting the light level and adjusting the shutter speed.  When your shutter speed is slower to allow more light in this gives you more time to move the camera and means image stabilization has more to process.  In other words it doesn't work very well.  The samsung has a quick shutter speed in low light situations and does a nice job of compensating for the light therefore also making your pictures clearer and brighter.  This is from my experience and the BB rep gave me a demonstration of it when I had narrowed my choices between a canon elph with wifi and the samsung.", "Date": "April 3, 2013"}, {"Title": "So far so good", "Author": "John kaufman", "ReviewID": "R2TGG42Y94CO17", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "I was planning on purchasing this camera from amazon, but ended up with a good deal on an open box at Best Buy.  I've tested the camera out and have to say for what I bought it for it looks excellent.Photo qualityThis was my main consideration when buying a new camera. I have to say that the camera does not disappoint me at all.  I've taken indoor low light pics, as well as outdoor pictures of my dogs running around at full speed with only the automatic settings, and the pictures have all come out better than expected.  Action shots are frozen and crisp, and close up portraits are significantly better than I expected, not $1200 DLSR quality, but for a sub $200 point and shoot, WAY better than expected - I doubt the average person could tell the difference.  The portraits show clear subject, no distortion, excellent color and shallow depth of field just like a DLSR and all on auto settings.Video QualityVideo quality is good, the 1080p video looks decent - the image stabilization is good but not great.  The main drawback is that there is a very noticeable noise picked up by the microphone when zooming.  - again for a cheap point and click to use for occasional video the quality is good.  To use as a primary video camera and create your next masterpiece, not so good.One nice thing about video is that you can just press the red video button on the back of the camera to begin recording.  You don't have to find a special setting etc... so it's very quick and easy to go into video mode.  The other nice thing is that while videoing you can still take pictures with no effect on the video.FeaturesThe photo features are what you would expect for a camera in this range. It does also have on camera editing, for cropping, \"Instagram Like\" effects can be carried out in the camera etc...One very nice feature is the touch screen.  I have a Galaxy Note 2 and really like the feature of touching the spot on the screen that I want focused on in camera mode.  This camera has the same feature.  So if the camera is focusing on something in the foreground or background, you just touch on the subject on your screen and the camera changes focus to the right spot.Wireless / Remote connection to phoneThis is truly the best part of the camera.  It has built in wireless connectivity, so you can e-mail photos, upload to facebook, picasa, upload videos to youtube, etc... directly from the camera. No more waiting until you get home and connecting to your computer to do something with the pictures.The coolest part of this functionality is the connection to your smartphone.  Download the samsung app, and you can use your smartphone as the viewfinder and take pictures without using a timer, or touching the camera. This is great for taking pictures of yourself with your kids.. seriously, I have hundreds of pictures of my kids and I am not in any of them because I'm always taking the pictures, I think this will change that.It also can be used to download pictures from your camera right to your phone so any pics taken on the camera appear in your phone's gallery in seconds.  That means you can e-mail, text message, facebook etc... from your phone just like you are used to. I LOVE this!!!Build QualityBuild quality could be better, but what do you expect at the price point? The only thing I really wish it had that it doesn't and I'm a little disappointed in is the tripod threading is all plastic, instead of metal.  I'm worried that using on a tripod will damage the threads and not be able to use a tripod again.  I'm also leery of tightening the tripod too firmly because of this.ConclusionI was considering buying the Galaxy Camera - but at double the price, I get the similar image quality, it appears to be running android internally although I can't play angry birds on my camera - which for me was not a huge selling point anyways... So considering the price difference, this seemed to be a much better deal for the same basic photo, video, wireless features. It is a very pocketable size, the photo quality is excellent - way better than I expected, and automatically downloading pictures to my phone - and computer wirelessly are exactly what I wanted.I am happy with the camera so far, but gave it 4 stars because of the following:- Tripod threads plastic not metal- Zoom noise during video recording.- Remote viewfinder app is amazing, but I wish it gave full control over the camera - changing scene modes, burst shots, etc... The feature is great, but could use a little polish.", "Date": "July 1, 2013"}, {"Title": "I'd rate at 3.5 stars. With some improvements, Samsung could have gotten a 4 or 4.5", "Author": "M. Sarkar", "ReviewID": "R2J5QKO34IUD07", "Overall": "3.0", "Content": "I carry a compact camera in my pocket quite often and generally prefer the older models with CCD sensors over the glitzy newer models with their 1/2.5 inch CMOS sensors. For the past 2-3 years, I've looked to upgrade for the wider 24-25 mm lenses and the 12-20x zooms on newer cameras, and had hoped that at least one manufacturer would put in a rotating LCD screen (or even a viewfinder, for those glaring sunny days) in a compact pocketable camera. I am not a pixel-peeper and I try to avoid post-processing on the computer. I do not expect to print any larger than 8x10 inch, so I have reasonable expectations from a compact travel camera. Hopefully, that gives you an idea about my perspective on photography with a point-and-shoot compact.I'll touch on some points below, having already posted some thoughts in replies to other reviews here and on the older WB150F model's pages. Your opinions might obviously vary from mine, but please TEST the camera before you question/comment :-)With the WB250F, image quality is quite good. I've used the P (program) mode, the Auto and the Scene modes. I'm planning to post pics on Google+ using the hashtag #POAB and maybe even a comparison with the Sony HX10V and my older workhorse compact, the Samsung v70 (1/1.8 inch CCD sensor).For indoor use, I set ISO to 200. The flash power was adequate and image quality was good, too.The ability to change settings using the physical buttons, the touchscreen or a combination of both definitely makes this WB250F camera fun to use - and it's often faster than scrolling though menus.The placement of the pop-up flash, closer to the middle of the body is much more ergonomic than many other cameras. Unlike the Sony and Canon travel zoom models in/above this price range, you can grip the camera quite nicely with BOTH hands and not have to worry about having a finger over the flash. You have to press a button to pop the flash up. I'm sure users' feelings are mixed about having to manually pop the flash.I'll agree with C. Bruce that the WB250F does pretty well in low light mode: it takes a short burst of pics in low light, then flattens them into a single image with fairly good detail. In my experiments, the ISO climbed to 1280 but the image remained usable. Some cameras like the Sony HX10V might easily climb to ISO 3200 in low light mode, but the pics become noisy.This WB250F camera has a \"Rich Tones\" mode that uses HDR. In my tests, mostly on dawn and sunset skies, the HDR result seemed a lot more \"real\" as compared to the red-shifted \"watercolor painting\" that I got from a Sony in HDR mode. I like a vivid pic as much as anyone else, but the Sony's HDR went overboard and seemed too fake to me (I prefer \"real\" over overprocessed photos designed to elicit \"oohs\" and \"aahs\").Macros come out fine. Colors are pleasing, and without over-saturation.You can adjust sharpness and contrast via the menu.Video quality at 720p, MP4 settings seemed good to my eyes, but I haven't tested extensively. The dedicated video button is located close to the raised thumbgrip. Zooming during video is possible, but you risk \"focus hunting\" even if you zoom as slowly as possible.In playback mode, the touchscreen allows swiping to move back or forth. Not a huge thing, but an obvious touch (pun intended) coming from Samsung's giant footprint in smartphones. Toggling the \"display\" button (the top of the four-way controller) quickly shows a histogram and the exposure, etc data. One major frustration in playback mode is that the lower ~1/8th of the screen in playback mode gets partly obscured by a panel containing two \"soft\" buttons. So, unless you patiently wait a few seconds, you cannot see the entire photo in playback. Utterly irresponsible of the Samsung designers. Rather, incomprehensible, given how many other things have been nicely thought through and implemented in the touchscreen user interface.The WB250F's 18x optical zoom is snappy but poorly implemented: it doesn't zoom in reasonably smooth increments. I wonder if the zoom is too fast by intention, or is the zoom lever too sensitive? The initial optical zoom between 1x - approx 5x is fine. However, after 7.8x, it jumps to about 12x, then about 15x, finally 18x. With the jerky zoom, I find it hard to frame a pic at just the right zoom for the scene. Also, the camera often hunts for focus, even when set to center focus. I've played with Program, Manual, Auto and the zoom issue persists. The zoom only gets smoother once in *digital* zoom at 19x and above (but pic quality will suffer if using digital zoom).Focus hunting is fairly common with this camera. This happens sometimes even with good light when focusing on objects without sharp lines, e.g. clouds. Knowing that multi-point focus is more work for the camera, I keep it set to center-weighted focus. So, I'll lock in focus on a distant tree, then point the camera at the cloud. In some (but not all) cases, the camera focuses faster when set to \"action shot\" using the S mode on the selector dial. Focusing needs improvement - hope Samsung is listening.If anyone else here can comment on their camera's optical zoom and its smoothness on the WB250F, I'd appreciate it. Not sure if Samsung can make the zoom smoother with a firmware update, but I'd love the camera if it had a decent usable range in optical zoom and faster focusing.", "Date": "April 5, 2013"}, {"Title": "Awesome Camera - Must have for fast travel", "Author": "Outdoor Chef", "ReviewID": "R1JIDSNEWI5ZYR", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I have been doing amateur photography for over 20 years.

Baer \"Steve\"", "ReviewID": "R1AXM25H6FWZ1G", "Overall": "3.0", "Content": "The camera is OK and has lots of features. Its also fairly easy to use in a getting started mode, without reading too much of the manual. But be sure to download the full manual. It is really annoying that manufacturers don't want to spend the few bucks to include a decent printed manual for basic use.There is a serious flaw however if you are buying this camera for its WIFI features. The Samsung remote shutter AP does not work with the Samsung Note 3. When the Camera tries to mate with the Note 3 and this Samsung AP, the Note 3 tries to find an internet connection. The Note 3 then says: \"Checking quality of internet connection\" waits a bit, and then says: \" Network disabled because internet is slow.\"I have searched the web and find that others have mentioned the same thing. Apparently there does not seem to be a way to tell the Note 3 that on a WIFI connection to this camera that it should only run peer to peer with the camera, and forget the internet.I have been able to get the camera to mate with my home WIFI network and email a picture. This seems to work, although the picture file size was compressed in the process.I have not been able to use the WIFI auto-backup function, since this has a bug as well that causes timeout. It shows up as a connection quality issue on the camera and PC, even when they are close to each other. I suspect its similar to the one above. i will have to research more.I have spent a couple of hours already on the chatline with Samsung, and find that they do not understand these issues well. I finally gave up with them, and learned more on the web.My virus detector also noted a virus threat in the Samsung PC launcher software, although it seems to work OK. The Samsung launcher did successfully update the firmware in the new camera.Overall, the WB250F appears to be a decent replacement for my dead Cannon Elph. BUT DONT BUY IT FOR ITS WIFI. Researching WIFI fixes and patches is not what I had in mind when I made this camera purchase decision.My background: Electrical EngineerUpdate 11/20/13The problem with the SAMSUNG remote viewfinder using the SAMSUNG NOTE 3 and the SAMSUNG WB250f seems to be widespread. I went to the XDA developers forum and found a good discussion of it using the Search: \"WiFi problems: \"Network disabled because Internet connection is slow\". Some people say to uncheck the \"always allow scanning\" box on the Note 3 WIFI advanced page. In my case,that was already unchecked. BUT when I unchecked the \"Auto network switch\" box on that same page, the WB250f started to mate properly with the Note 3, and the remote viewfinder worked. Be sure to recheck it when through, if you want to have a data connection away from a WIFI network. P.S. My note 3 is Verizon.Many Thanks to XDA Developers Forum!!!SAMSUNG tech support and chat could save many frustrating hours of their and customer time if they learned about this.Steve", "Date": "November 19, 2013"}, {"Title": "Great Camera!", "Author": "Melissa Faires", "ReviewID": "R3HLKS45M98BYJ", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I bought this camera for my trip to Hawaii, what a deal! the camera is light and small enough to fit into my purse.

It's a nice looking camera with a lot of features, but I mainly bought it for its ability to email pictures directly from the camera.  In addition to their regular camera, my parents had been using their iPad on vacation to take pictures so that they could email them to show me.  I always felt that it must be awkward holding a huge tablet like a camera while standing at the top of a scenic lookout point.  I had visions of a strong gust of wind blowing their tablet over the edge of a cliff.  So I started looking for something with the form factor of a regular camera that they could use instead.  As long as it took decent pictures (not blurry, good colors) and functioned in a way they could understand, they could use it as their main camera.Pros:- Assuming you're connected to a wifi network, emailing photos is pretty easy because it doesn't require setting up an email account beforehand, and there's no login required.  You only need to enter your return email and the email to send to, and the photos are sent (up to 20 at a time) using Samsung's email servers.  You can set up a default return email, and it remembers a number of recent \"send to\" emails that you can optionally choose from a list.  If the photos are large, they're shrunken down to a manageable size for sending but are still a good quality for viewing.- The hybrid touch screen makes it a little easier to choose options, since my parents always found it hard to use the more cryptic buttons on other cameras.- It's easier for my parents to equate \"flash on\" with \"popped up flash\" and \"flash off\" with \"no popped up flash\".  There are ways for customizing this setting, but I set it up this way for them.  Now they don't need to call me to ask how to turn the flash on/off as they used to with their previous camera.- The 18x optical zoom is powerful and will let you take pictures much closer than the naked eye can see.- Pictures outdoors in bright light are nice and crisp.Cons:- The camera is somewhat buggy.  On two occasions, the camera would not turn on even though the battery was charged.  Fix: Pop the battery in and out, and the camera turns on again.- Sometimes the camera will not connect to a remembered wifi connection for some unknown reason.  Fix: Forget the wifi connection, and set it up again by re-entering the password.- Sometimes the camera will not connect to a remembered backup PC for wifi photo transfer.  I hope this doesn't happen often because I don't know of a reliable, easy fix, and it will be painful talking my parents through it over the phone.- It's harder to connect to a wifi network at a public location where you need to accept a login agreement.  The camera shows you a small browser window, but the check boxes are often too small for fingers to press, and you need to use the physical buttons to navigate and press check boxes.  This is harder because it once again requires the use of the more cryptic buttons.- The 18x zoom only functions in certain large increments, so you don't get the full incremental range of zoom up to 18x.  Also, at high levels of zoom, it takes a while for the camera to auto focus.  The scene will be blurry for a couple seconds before it comes into focus.- Pictures indoors with no flash or in low light are more blurry than other cameras.  You need to hold the camera extremely still for a good chance at a non-blurry picture.- The DIRECT LINK button is located in an area where the camera is commonly held (upper left corner), and thus can be easily pressed by mistake.- The USB cable that comes with the camera is very short.  I replaced it with a longer one to avoid the possibility of the camera being knocked off a table while charging.This camera has some good features, but it has bugs that make it not as ready for primetime as it could be.  Hopefully, future software updates will solve some problems.  Note: My review only covers the more basic features that my parents use.", "Date": "January 10, 2014"}, {"Title": "Great camera for its price but know its limitations", "Author": "JayeP", "ReviewID": "RNQ9J0H4NCMSN", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I've had this camera for about 3 months now and have used it on a regular basis.  First off, this is not my one and only camera but an EDC- everyday carry.  I purchased this camera as a compact camera that I can fit in my bag and take everywhere, everyday.  I previously owned the WB150f, and I was very pleased with its performance.  As I stated in that review, if you are looking to purchase a camera with spectacular IQ akin to DSLRs or even IQ on par with high end compact cameras, this camera is not for you.  However, if you're looking for a camera that takes pretty good pictures, has the convenience of WiFi to upload quickly to FB to share your photos with your friends/family, has the capacity to quickly transfer photos between your camera and your smartphone and has a great optical zoom range, you might want to consider this camera.When I was trying to decide what compact camera to buy this year, I brought my choices down to: 1) WB250f 2) Canon Powershot SX280 hs and 3) Samsung Galaxy Camera.  The Canon was tempting because admittedly, it probably has better IQ than either of the Samsung cameras.  However, it lacked the touchscreen that WB250f has, and I know that inputing passwords and email info on a non-touchscreen was too much of a hassle for me.  Truthfully, the Samsung Galaxy Camera was my number one choice.  It has full Android on board with 3G/4G service.  It has everything that the WB250f has plus more.  BUT, it came with a bigger price tag on what is essentially last year's technology.  The Galaxy Camera is basically a WB850f merged with a Galaxy S3 smartphone minus the call feature.  After much thought, I decided to get the WB250f since the price was cheaper, and I couldn't justify paying the early adopter tax for last year's technology.  The CPU and RAM is better on my Galaxy Note 2.  The screen is bigger on my Note 2 than the Galaxy Camera.  Considering how easy it is to connect my Note 2 to my WB250f, I am pleased that I made the right choice for me.Since there are quite a few detailed reviews of the WB250f on tech/photo sites, I'll just touch on things that I noticed while using this camera for the last 3 months.IQGreat IQ comes with a price tag.  The IQ, for the price of this camera is absolutely fine with me.  Sure, if this was a high end compact camera or a DLSR lens, I would've been disappointed.  But for a sub-$200 compact, I have no complaints.  The photos are sharp enough, and if you want it sharper, there is an option to increase the sharpness under image adjust.  There are many options to increase the vividness of the color- you could select the Vivid option in smart mode or even set the contrast and saturation higher in image adjust.  Low light performance is great for its size.  High ISO tends to be grainy but I think it is usable up to ISO800.  Also, the low light option under smart mode does a pretty good job although some images might appear soft depending on how dark the environment is.ZOOMI love the optical zoom!  To have this much optical zoom in a camera this tiny is very useful for me especially when I am hiking and run into wildlife.  As someone else mentioned, the zoom is not smooth so micro adjustments are hard to make.  It's not a deal breaker for me- I can live with it.FOCUSThe WB250f hunts for focus at full zoom in darker environment or at very close macro.  Since I usually use ASM mode most of the time, I just set the focus manually.FEATURESI don't use automatic mode so I can't comment on the effectiveness of that.  I really enjoy using the ASM mode or the Smart mode depending on the situation, and I have been pleased with the results.  I also use the tilt-shift filter here and there for fun.  Also, this camera takes gif so I've had lots of fun making them straight from the camera.CONNECTIVITYI have had no issues connecting my phone to the camera using the Samsung Smart Camera App.  File transfers are quick, and the remote viewfinder works great.  I have also connected the camera with my iPad without any problems.  The camera connects seamlessly to my Netgear router, and I have had no issues uploading my photos directly to FB.CONCLUSIONThe WB250f is a great, fun camera if you purchase it knowing its limitations.  It will never give you DSLR-like nor high end compact camera IQ.  If IQ is the single most important factor for you, then it's probably better to spend a little more money and buy a different camera.  If you're just looking for a compact camera that is fun to use, has connectivity features and produces good photos then you might want to give this camera a go.  Since pictures speak a thousand words, you might want to do a search on Flickr for the camera and see what everyday users have uploaded.", "Date": "July 7, 2013"}, {"Title": "Nice camera for the price", "Author": "Fishnphil", "ReviewID": "R39K7ORJV23A10", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "The family loves it since the interface is similar to a modern smartphone with the connection to wifi.

Camera is amazing on the auto-focus. The WiFi capabilities are without equal on other similar cameras. One concern for the future is the design of the flash portion, as the plastic release may wear down leaving no way for the flash to be stowed.

That alone sells the Samsung over any other compact camera.1. The Samsung is a little larger, and heavier, but it still fits easily in my pocket. One advantage of the slight increase in thickness is the handy hand-grip on the right side of the Samsung. The Canon was so slight and smooth that it could easily slide out of your hand. Of course for any of these small cameras, never use them without the wristband.3. The Samsung has a larger zoom, but seems to go in steps rather than smoothly, as does the Canon.I can live with this feature of the Samsung, because the 18 zoom is impressive. It is hard to hold the camera steady at this zoom, so I will be getting a tripod.4. Now that I have tried both cameras I find the Samsung more user-friendly, although using advanced features on either camera requires careful use of the user's manual. It is important to me that the Samsung has aperture and shutter priority, which the Canon, for some reason, lacked.  Each camera has some features that the other one lacks, but the aperture and shutter priority are the most important for me.5. I had not originally chosen the Samsung WB 250 because several professional reviews had said that it's photographs were not too good, especially compared to the Canon 330. But I am happy enough with what I see, even on a computer screen, with my Samsung. I think the professional reviewers, to their credit, use all kinds of sophisticated software to find technical imperfections in the camera's pictures that I can't see. I do not expect that I will want large professional posters, so I am satisfied with what I have seen.Whatever camera you buy, you have to do a number of things before starting.1. Order an SDHC memory card in the same order as your camera.  I bought a Sony SDHC 15 GB class 10 card for about $15 from Amazon.2. Download the manual from the camera website, and start getting acquainted with the camera.3. Make sure the battery is charged before starting with the camera.4. Format the memory card. It is a little hard to find out to do this in the user's manual.5. Make sure you save all the original wrappings in case you have to return the camera.Good luck with whatever camera you buy.

I read tons of reviews and watched youtube video product reviews and compared specs, etc etc etc. I finally narrowed it down between this guy, and a Sony (can't remember the exact model number at the moment). They both had awesome reviews, and both seemed like really good cameras, but the Sony (another superzoom at 20x optical) was a hundred dollars more. If they had been the same price, I would have probably picked the Sony, but only because of the flash on this camera. The sony had the normal flash that's built into the camera (as opposed to the pop-up flash of this Samsung). That was the only real problem I had in making my decision, but I eventually opted for the samsung, and I LOVE it. I'm really happy with my decision. The flash doesn't bother me at all. I originally thought it would be a hassle, and easy to break off, but it actually seems pretty durable. And truthfully, I have yet to actually need the flash at all. Unless you're taking a picture in a dark room, there's no need for it, because this camera takes excellent low light photos. It's full of awesome features, but the \"auto\" takes great pictures on its own.The battery life also has exceeded my expectations. I've had this camera for over a month now, and I've only had to charge it once so far. I've taken 374 pictures, plus a few short videos, and one 20 minute long 1080HD video at a show we went to. The 20 minute video took the battery down from 3 bars to 2 bars, but that's it! I bought a replacement battery and a separate charger just in case, because I was used to AA batteries that I could easily swap. This is my first rechargeable battery camera, so I didn't know what to expect. I will never EVER go back to double A's. I could only get my old camera (kodak easyshare) to take about a minute and a half long video before it would automatically shut off and tell me the battery was dead, so this was a very welcome change.I'm also happy with the speed of this camera. My old camera would take about 10 seconds to turn on and load before it was ready to take a picture. This thing is ready in about 2.The menu's are easy to follow, and the hybrid touch screen is pretty cool. The video has it's own separate record button, which is nice, and you can take pictures at the same time as video, which is WAY better than having to decide whether you want a video of your kid blowing out their candles OR a picture. You can do both with this camera.I love that it uses a standard USB charging cable, because I already have car and wall chargers for USB cables (for my ipod), which is convenient. I also love that it uses a full size SD card instead of micro. Micro's get lost too easily, in my opinion.I haven't used the wi-fi feature yet, so I won't comment on that.The ONLY thing that sucks about this camera (for me) is that it's slightly longer than my last camera, so it doesn't fit into my designated camera pocket in my purse.

It produces really crystal clear pictures, using a variety of mechanisms for identifying on whom to focus.  The HD video (in both 1080p and 720p modes) is sharp and color-rich in all but the most low light conditions.  However, it has one unforgivable flaw (which is shared with many other DSLRs): it is limited to 20 minutes of video as a session, not because of memory space, but apparently to meet some European Union tariff requirement.  Yes, you can wait for it to finish processing the first 20 minutes, and start recording again -- but that is many seconds later.  If you need anything but very short video segments, you probably need to buy something that is primarily a video camera.Unfortunately, I bought this not on Amazon (where it would have been cheap), but at a local brick-and-mortar retailer, because I needed their expert advice on what to buy.  They apparently did not know about the 20 minute limit, and I discovered it after the 14 day exchange period had elapsed.  Yet another reason to buy from Amazon.

While the camera has lots of cool wifi features, they are clunky to use.2. Overall the intuitive feel for just taking pictures is non-existent. It feels like some engineer in a cubicle who never gets out designed the menu and control systems. This is my most hated aspect of the unit.3. Picture quality for a camera of this resolution is overall lackluster. Colors are bland, even when you tinker in menu.4. The resolution and end product seems that of a far cheaper camera.5. Long zoom is nice, but crappy optics with lots of distortion, coupled with a presumably horrible image sensor turn out picturs of things nice and close up, but horrible color, focus, and quality.6. Did I mention the menu ergonomics? UGH!7. Connectivity: I use EyeFi cards in all of my digital cameras... love the ease and speed and being able to copy videos and stills to my PC for archiving. The WB250F has BUILT IN connectivity, for backing up to your network (KLUDGEY) and to online services, such as Evernote, FB Youtube and SkyDrive (Microsoft) I have tried Samsung's \"AutoBackup\" that's built in, and it works, but it's MANUAL! I have to go into a menu on the camera and 'do it'. This is insane.Lastly, and this is VERY IMPORTANT: One of the connectivity features available to the user in the WiFi menu is Skydrive, as I mentioned.I have a Microsoft account, so I thought 'hey! I can use this, at least! It will backup my pictures to a folder in my Skydrive! Cool!Well, I set it all up, and once again (you have to) went in Manually and selected the pictures and Videos to upload... WHAT???? IT DOES NOT LET YOU UPLOAD VIDEOS!!!! This is RETARDED. Ok, so let's at least backup my stills.So, I manually selected a bunch of pictures and uploaded them. It worked, pretty fast too.. when it was done, I almost deleted those images (irreplaceable ones) from my SD card, but hesitated for some reason. From my PC, I checked in my SkyDrive folder,verified that the images had properly copied, and then chose to view some of them. um... wait, something isn't right here OMG>>  ... YOU HAVE GOT TO BE KIDDING ME.... SAMSUNG DOES NOT BACKUP THE ORIGINAL SIZE AND RESOLUTION OF YOUR PICTURES.

Your SD card is full so you upload everything to your SkyDrive. Great! DONE!!!! yay! You erase the card and take more pictures. Get home, look at them, zoom in ONCE and suddenly you see HEAVY pixelation... gasp... so then you double-check all of them, they are all the same... and then SCREAM OUT LOUD multiple bad words directed at the moronic GEEK engineers at Samsung.Holy crap, this is a HUGE deal.

Samsung is one of my favorite electronics manufacturers, and it was at a great price point considering all the features.But I have to say, I am a bit underwhelmed.  Based strictly on the number of megapixels and power of optical zoom, this should be a great camera, but it consistently underperformed a beat up old high zoom Panasonic that I have had for years, that was roughly half the megapixels and half the zoom.In good light without much zoom, it took okay photos, but if you have to push the zoom much, or shoot in low light, it just didn't take good pictures.  I did some side by side shots at night with all the lights on in my living room, with my other camera, and the photos were noticeably worse on the Samsung.  In bright daylight its not as obvious, but I am only a snapshot shooter, not shooting anything I was planing on blowing up anyway, so it might show up if you blew any of these photos up.The manual flash deployment is kind of cumbersome, and something you would expect to be automatic these days, but at this price point, I don't think you can complain too much about it, but it isn't exactly seamless to use the flash that is for sure.Shooting time.  This has to be the worst camera I have had in over 10 years on trying to get it to take a quick photo.  I am not sure if its an autofocus issue or something else.  But whip out the camera, power it up, get an image in the viewfinder, and push the button.  It may eventually take a picture, or you may just be sitting there holding the button down, with no error beep, but no picture either.  I missed a ton of those cute shots where you see something you want to take a picture of and you have to take it in the next few seconds or its gone... well with this camera it will be gone.  Since the camera doesn't turn on with the flash deployed automatically, its not a flash delay (but there is definitely some charging time when you do deploy the flash).  It also doesn't appear to be related to initial power on either, as I have had the camera out and waiting and the shot comes up and you mash the button, and nothing happens on a regular basis.  When it does autofocus, its not particularly quick, and I find that the focus point is wrong more than in past cameras.Buttons, this camera kept getting turned on while inside my jacket pocket, luckily most of the time, I could hear it turn on, before it ran my battery down.  When shooting photos it was easy to  bump any number of button on the back that were not helpful when shooting picturesCase:  The case feels very light weight and doesn't inspire confidence.Internet features.  I really wanted to try a camera that had this feature, in particular, I wanted to be able to back up my photos online when on an out of town or overseas trip, when I can find some free wifi.  Unfortunately it doesn't work really well.  First off several of the online uploads, will trigger fraud prevention even when connecting from home.  If you are at some random coffee shop or a hotel like I was its even worse as just about all of them will trip fraud prevention from a random place like that.  Also I wasn't able to clear the fraud prevention from my phone (using the hotel wifi).  Even after clicking \"Yup thats me\" on the alert emails, I was still locked out of my Google and MSN accounts afterwards, which was a pain to re-enable, and also burned that password which you can't switch back to.So if by some miracle you get the wifi to work, lets use the auto upload feature mentioned in the description.  Well auto upload means going through and selecting individually every photo you would like to upload, which is a painstakingly slow process.  how about just keeping track of what I have already uploaded and ask to upload the rest?  I thought I read somewhere, that the photos that are uploaded to skydrive and google images will not be full resolution photos either, so not really a true back up either.So I got home after having the internet stuff fall on its face whlie traveling.  So I thought I would use the wireless upload to my local computer (very slow even though its local) and that eventually error-ed out with no way to figuire out what was uploaded and what wasn't without doing it the old fashion way.Was any of the wireless stuff useful, yes, I uploaded some photos to facebook successfully.  But if you want to multi select, you can't see the images clearly to determine if these are the ones you want.  You can look at the images one by one and tell them to individually upload, but that eats up a bunch more time and battery as each photo now goes through the connect to the internet, authorize on facebook process in addition to upload.  All photos upload into a directory labeled WB250F, and if you want to go in and do anything to the images like rearrange them, oriented them, add tags, descriptions etc, you better have brought you ipad for that.  But if you brought you ipad in the first place, you probably would be better off downloading them there first, where you can get a good look at them, and change orientation and then upload to facebook through the ipad.So in the end, I think it takes okay pictures in bright light as long as you haven't used all the zoom that they provide.  The wireless isn't useful for what I wanted, but was nice to do a couple of quick uploads to facebook.

I familiarized myself with the basic settings and video mode, as well as some of the scene modes.  Forgive me if this review is not as detailed, but I will update as I use it more.I already own a Pentax K-5 and usually at home with Manual photography, so this was a simple point and click solution for me.I was surprised the case was plastic.  It does feel cheap on the outside, but it is sturdy.Auto mode works relatively well.  Camera seems to choke upon startup and taking it's first photo sometimes.  I alreadyhad updated the firmware prior.  Picture quality is good.  Lens is nice and captures good wide angle for most scenes.Zoom is sluggish and takes too long to engage quickly.  Also small micro adjustments seem harder to do with zoom....there is a noticable delay in the motor.  Also, in video mode, you can sometimes hear the motor when zooming.I took full HD 1080 video and was very happy with the results.  Quality and color saturation was good.Regarding the WiFi Mode, I think it would have been a far better solution if the camera could be it's own Transmitter to standard wireless rather than just to a smart phone app.  I didn't understand this initially and assumed it could be configured that way.  Transferring just to a phone is not advantageous so wondering if Samsung can re-program this so that it can become a standard SSID for wireless and have a secure ID manually configured.Overall Picture quality is good.  I haven't used manual mode and to be honest, it is much more cumbersome on a point and click camera.....than an SLR which is relatively easy.The scene filters are okBattery seems to be just fine for a full day of use, but beware video.  Video really drains the battery, and quickly.  My tests of shooting mostly bursts of 2-3 minute videos more then halved the runtime.  When you turn it off, it seems to recover about a bar each time, but invest in another battery.  I would dedicate one for video and another just for photos.Also, why did Samsung provide such a short short USB charging cable?  Because of this, you will wind up charging your device from a wall jack on the floor.  Not a good thing.  USB charging through a PC is extreemly slow.  Invest in a seperate charger when you purchase spare batteries.  I just found a good deal for two batteries plus external charger for 20.00.More tests ongoing.11/25/2013Ok I thought I would update this review and bring a few other key points up.Note that this camera will not take raw images.  Both Still Images and Video are only in compressed formatsThat being said, the JPEG compression quality is fine for a point and shoot.  I am still pretty impressed by the quality of the HD video.- Also, about the motor sound that you can sometime hear in the videos, it appears Samsung has an Electronic Audio damper that engages during video to minimize this.It appears to lessen the particular audio frequency that the motor has when in use.  It sometimes does not engage all the time when used and some bleed throughhappens with the motor sound.  If you are taking straight video with the intention of editing it later, it should be of no issue, but if you are filming a musical performance and using the onboard mic then it will be an issue.- Also, no external mic can be attached..........", "Date": "October 4, 2013"}, {"Title": "Great price for the cobalt blue!", "Author": "N.

Buying the WB250F on Amazon.com afterwards made this a far less riskier and less costly effort in case I wanted to return the device. Without any doubts or regrets, I know this is totally the best all-around camcorder I've bought in the last 7 years as an avid photographer and videographer for my fine art and journalism projects -- and it's pocket sized too.For me, (compared to similar Nikon, Canon, Sony and Kodak options -- I own a larger Canon camcorder)  this particular Samsung digital camcorder has both the simplicity and wide sophistication I genuinely need for no-hassle high-quality photos and high-definition videos. However, when I need or want to get deep into the weeds of features for complicated projects, the WB250F offers so many other capabilities that help me step-up my game on the final results -- even if I don't use any of my usual special effects PC software and camera apps, much of which is on this camcorder already. I may not end-up using some of this camera's many tools, yet it's still good to have them if I ever needed to use them directly on the device -- especially since I have some documentary projects that I've been wanting to do without carrying any bulky devices. Even using my current external USB connected microphone is a snap when not using the very clear top-side camera mic. I'm also happy to have both the uncomplicated manual buttons and touchscreen viewfinder controls. Simply perfect for setups and live recordings. Yes -- the WB250F has a threaded hole for secure tripod mounting too, which is especially needed for my documentaries and webcasts.The quiet motorized telephoto lens is just perfection for every up-close and distant indoor/outdoor purposes. The WB250F, unlike 99 percent of all other digital cameras, has a very useful tilt-adjustable pop-up flash for my bounce and direct lighting effect needs. BE SURE to buy a small hard case, a Guarmor screen protector, suitable lens cap (fitting the outermost body turret when the camera is not in use), the $20 Square Trade 3-Year Camera Protection Plan (truly TOTALLY worth it), and especially a 32GB or 64GB (80MB/s or 90MB/s) SD memory card for reliably fast content storing and transferring. These five must-haves are for my TOTAL peace-of-mind during extensive project productions, and years of ordinary casual use!My written recommendation could be much longer. So, I'll just finally add that if you're in the market for a truly affordable all-purpose easy to hold and use (plus QUICK TO LEARN) camcorder that's no bigger (but far-far better) than your smartphone (and thick as 3 pencils) and with more tools than most portable camcorders or still photo cameras -- this is really your overall best buy. If you already own a Samsung Galaxy smartphone and tablet like me, then this is Android productivity heaven (though the WB250F is both a Windows and Mac compatible device) when Wi-Fi syncing-viewing-transmitting videos and photos to your e-mail, cloud storage, external hard drive storage, social media sites, websites, or any Windows and Mac PC with or without the WB250F USB power cord. Let me not forget to say that the battery life during extended video and photo taking, as well as Wi-Fi uploading, is beyond acceptable.Truly, this is not just some personal hype of mine, but this quality of handheld camcorder again makes me wonder why my TV or print news friends and associates still need those heavy-bulky-expensive ENG devices anymore -- especially since their news networks or stations are always requesting and USING so much video and photo content from non-professional everyday viewers or sources these days. For my money, just a group of five to fifteen responsible and informed people each with one of these durable WB250F camcorders -- and there's your online global news network. Even an online neighborhood and small town news service, or a one-person streaming and live video website (vlog or blog) with or without YouTube is doable. Think about it. Nearly everyone, from kids to seniors, has a pocket TV-radio-magazine-newspaper (AKA: smartphone, or phablet)! All you need is a WB250F camcorder.Oh yes, in case you had this thought like I did, the HD 1080p videos and photos look and sound spectacular even on my 21-inch PC monitor and 42-inch HD TV screen via Wi-Fi or a USB/AV cord, Since Samsung and others are producing newer and pricier camcorder models for 2014 -- just on principle for my sweet-spot of high quality, long term features, durability, and the reasonable price that I wanted -- the WB250F is still the right one to buy and use without any reservation or regret. BE SURE to download the very detailed (but easy to understand) PDF user manual (English or French) at Samsung's support website (just search: Samsung WB250F user manual PDF), as well as the Samsung i-Launcher Guide PDF for all the obvious, unknown and flexible features built into this digital gem not revealed in most reviews or descriptions. After scanning the 164-page user manual, I know for sure my money was much more than well spent.Of course, thank you very much Amazon for the best low price, easy comparisons, and very quick shipping too!", "Date": "April 20, 2014"}, {"Title": "Does not upload to Facebook.", "Author": "Paul Wheatley", "ReviewID": "R3DZ5QYN91YCOM", "Overall": "3.0", "Content": "The camera is a great little camera at a reasonable price.

The cost of the item is more relevant than the location of purchase. It's a nice camera at a nominal price. Please note I am not camera savvy. I have not purchased or owned a camera since the camera market was 35mm film dominated, with the exception of cellular phone cameras. My lack of knowledge of camera technology works in favor of Samsung considering I have little to compare. The camera is somewhat idiot proof, provided you read the instructions. I say somewhat because there will ALWAYS be someone to make a liar of that testament. It doesn't require an advanced degree to turn it on and take a picture. The camera is aesthetically pleasing (I have the white with chrome trim). I love the WiFi capabilities. WiFi capabilities played a tremendous part of my decision making. I enjoy the hybrid touch screen. The size is perfect for a pocket or purse person. The body of the camera feels quite sturdy unlike some of it's plastic competitors.I dread the flash! The flash looks cheap and fragile. Do I regret my purchase? Somewhat. Not because I am not enjoying the camera, because I desire more zoom. This camera is limited to 18X optical zoom. I'd prefer an optical zoom 30+, but it's difficult to find optimal zoom of that degree with WiFi and simplicity of use. Honestly, the average consumer does not need most of the perks many digital cameras offer.I'm still learning the device. I'd recommend this camera for users on a budget, especially those with minimal knowledge of photography, who desire an easily accessible, user friend device.

I'll be honest; I read many professional reviews online for the WB250F and most said this produced photos no better than a cell phone.....and I blew those reviews off as more than likely being too picky and/or not knowing what they were talking about.Those professional reviewers were right. The photos produced by this camera are NOT that great. They aren't sharp enough and the colors are dull even on the auto setting. This camera produces better videos than photos. I'd rather spend more money and get better photo quality since that's what I've been used to getting.Besides the crummy photo quality, I also thought the power on/off button was a little too sensitive or maybe in the wrong location as I turned it on twice by accident while trying to put it in my camera case.It's an easy camera to figure out - the touch screen is responsive and the wi-fi is easy to set up.

Paulon", "ReviewID": "R2M41PV3L6HBHK", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I would have given the WB250F 3.5 or 4 stars based on its original retail price of $249 which would have been in line with the expert reviews.  However, at its current price around $129, the camera rightly deserves a 5 stars.  There is not a point and shoot camera on the market that can match the WB250F with all of its features for the price.Is price important?  Well, I would say absolutely if the quality is there.  For example, you can spend $698 on a Sony M100 II with a better sensor and lense, but that is a whopping $569 more than the WB250F.  Would most amateur photography tell the difference?  I doubt it, since for the most part, the Samsung WB250F takes excellent pictures.  This was the main criticism stated by the experts; the picture quality was a bit soft.  I have found no such problem.  The pictures are accurate and in focus.  There is a tendency for indoor shots to be a bit dull (faded) in color but  outdoor shots are fully saturated and crisp.What makes this camera a stand out are the features found in no other camera at this price point and they work.  I don't have a smart phone, but I did send pictures via WiFi to various email accounts with 100% success  Also, you can back up your photos on a laptop or other WiFi devices.The touch screen is outstanding with easy to understand instructions.Samsung has been in the electronics business for a long time, but I was a bit skeptical about its camera quality over my ZS5 Panasonic and Nixon D70 both of which I own.

I did some side-by-side tests with an old Sony DSC HX5V and printed the results.  In some cases the Samsung pictures were a little better, in some cases a little worse.  I didn't have a single picture that made me say \"Wow, that's a great picture!\"I was hoping that even though it's a cheaper camera, the fact that it was 3-4 years newer than the Sony would have resulted in better image quality.  In general it did not.Some pros:The WiFi features are cool and are the real reason I bought the camera.  They generally worked although YouTube blocked connections from this camera as \"suspicious.\"  I had the same issue with a Blu Ray player that had YouTube connectivity.  Google is apparently pretty aggressive in blocking connections that don't come through a browser.Some cons:The flash button is fiddly.  Sometimes it took several hard presses to get it to pop up.  The auto-focus can be really slow, sometimes even in good lighting.  On numerous occasions it wouldn't lock focus at all, even outside during the day.  That prompted me to return the camera.On returning the camera, I ran into an issue.  All your personal logins -- email, Facebook, YouTube, WiFi, etc. -- are permanently stored in the camera.  Doing a reset from the settings menu erases the WiFi login but nothing else.  I contacted Samsung customer service and the rep told me there was no way to erase them.  I asked if there was a way to do a factory reset and he said \"no.\"A few days later I contacted Samsung again and got directions from a different person.  In case you ever need them, here they are:1. Power up the camera. Set the dial to Auto as if you were going to take a picture.2. Zoom to the widest setting, then press the shutter button simultaneously for a couple of seconds.3. Power off.4. Power back up to confirm your settings are deleted.This will erase all your login info (facebook, email, etc.).  You will still need to erase your WiFi password.  To do this, set the dial to \"settings\" (the gear icon) and there is a \"reset\" option in the menus.  This will delete your Wifi password.Inconvenient, but ultimately it all worked out OK.So...the camera is cheap but the performance isn't very impressive.

I own Samsung TV's and our cell phones/tablets are Samsung and even our fridge is Samsung and love them so decided to take a chance on the the WB250F. The fact that it had wifi capabilities was a selling point for me. Being able to instantly transfer pics to our phones and tablets was great. I can even instantly view pics on my TV. Technology nowadays is just overwhelming sometimes. Anyhow, the camera takes great pics except in low light. Maybe 5 out of 10 pics in low light are good. When there's ample light the pictures are great however. The outer shell is made of plastic which was expected with Samsung products but it does feel solid. It is a little bigger than most compact cameras. Battery life is not great but decent. My Sony DSC-WX50 and my DSLR can go alot longer before needed charging. I think the battery drains alot faster when your using the wifi.Overall the this camera is good for the price. I was just looking for something small to bring occasionally instead of my DSLR and this fit my bill. Its not the most advance point-and-shoot but for the wifi capabilities and great pics (not low light), I recommend. The low light picture quality and the battery life was the reason for only 4 stars, otherwise I would have given 5.EDIT 12/30/13: The low light picture quality bothers me a bit. I guess I'm just so used to DSLR low light quality. Overall its a great budget camera with wifi capabilities.

You can download an app for iphone or smartphone and the camera can send a picture to said phone but it takes a few steps to do it and it's not seamless, especially after a few drinks;)  Still it works.  One thing that irritates me is the Slow power up.  It takes the camera a good 5 or 6 seconds to go from off to being ready to take a photo because of the touchscreen.  Not a deal breaker but it's annoying.  Also the flash is manual on this camera.  You have to push a release button on top of the camera to allow the flash to pop up and the first hundred photos I took I had to retake because I forgot the flash wasn't automatic.  The only other small complaint would be that the function control knob on top of the camera is loose and spins around at the slightest touch.

At lower zoom it works fine.Picture quality is so-so.Now for the good:The menus screens are simple and easy to navigate.The video is awesomeThe sound on the video spectacular.Let me go into detail.  While I am no photographer, I do dabble at making safety videos for work.  This camera's video capability (1080)  far exceeds the 720p of my smaller HD video camera I usually use for these videos.  I was working on sound bits at home, realizing I forgot to take my mic from work, I was about to give up for the night when it dawned on me I had the camera handy.

I wanted a small camera I could put in my bag and then hang around the truck so when a picture came up I would have it handy. This is pretty much your basic point & shoot camera it does everything pretty well, but you can match this up with your Samsung phone ( I have the S4) so you can sit this up on a tripod and use your phone to snap the picture. I've paired mine up already, and it was a breeze to do, I haven't taken a picture this way yet I wanting for it to get a little warmer and all the birds and butterflies are out but I can already imagine some nice shots with it set up this way.So all in all it's a nice little p&s; and it does take nice pictures.", "Date": "April 28, 2014"}, {"Title": "Like this camera", "Author": "K.

It's a nice point and shoot camera and I believe it is going to work very well for my needs. It is a little heavier than I thought it would be (hence the 4 stars) but it's not something I can't deal with. I own another Samsung point and shoot that I have had for 5 years and love it except I was looking for a better zoom. This camera to me, was reasonably priced for an 18X zoom so I thought I would try it and see.Great zoom pictures! Very clear and easy to use. I read other reviews that mentioned the zoom as being slow. I did not see this. What I like best about it is that it works identical to my other point and shoot so no learning curve for me. I also read reviews about the pop up flash and I understand what they are saying. I very seldom use a flash so I don't have a problem, but if you do use one you would have to be careful. I can see how it could break. I actually like the flash on this better than my other point and shoot because the flash on it is always on and you had to physically turn it off each time you turned the camera on.

The first being a crazy fast battery drain while shooting video...I shot 20 minutes of 1080p video and took maybe 25 flash photos and the battery was in the red...and since there is no stand alone wall charger for the removable battery you're stuck carrying the charging cord and wall wart everywhere you go.  I needed this camera to last through a full day if possible...and was easily able to drain the battery in just a couple of hours.  The second reason is that while it is a \"smart camera\"...I found that it is constantly shifting modes while in 'auto'...resulting in some fairly odd looking photos where plenty of light was available and the flash should not have been thrown...or images that were too dark when you would think the flash should operate.  Which leads me to the third reason...the pop-up flash...this (while perhaps a neat feature)...seems like it could easily snap off due to such a small mechanism...and I found myself having to take pictures several times in order to use the flash...the first shot I would forget to engage the small button to release the flash (I'll admit operator error here)...the second to retake the picture...and a third try to get it right....this is nonsense...I've got small kids and they don't sit still forever.I had high hopes based on some of the reviews...but in all seriousness...some of the settings and gimmicks make this camera seem more like a toy fit for a kid.Should've went with my gut and bought the Canon 330HS.", "Date": "November 4, 2013"}, {"Title": "Great Value", "Author": "Frank G.", "ReviewID": "R2ID60G14PNTXL", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "This point and shoot camera has fair to good picture quality.

This is less of a problem using my Panasonic Lumix with similar zoom range. Both tout image stabilization.* The white wrist strap was missing from the box.

That one was rather unique in having a front-facing LCD that makes it a lot easier to take selfies. It served us well for some time, but one day we found out the hard way that the zoom mechanism is very fragile. It was dropped from a pretty short distance and the whole thing jammed up. I disassembled the camera and repaired it myself, but from then on the autofocus was a wee bit wonky.The WB250F is similar in some respects, different in others. It has the same wi-fi options, no dual view, but touchscreen controls and 18x optical zoom (the DV300F and most other point and shoots are 5x). The zoom is probably the most notable feature of this camera, as it's exceptional for a point and shoot. Some others can reach that level with combination optical/digital zoom, but digital zoom in general is pretty awful- I'd say it borders on useless due to degradation in quality.The camera is surprisingly responsive for the cost. It has decent shutter speed and zooms quickly, and the touch controls respond fine. You can touch to focus just like a smartphone, which can be useful if the AF is misbehaving. That said, autofocus seems relatively fast and smart for a point and shoot. The zoom works very well- you can take close-ups of objects at long range with very good quality. It's not quite as good as a DSLR with a telephoto lens, but hey- that's not what you're after if you're even looking at this.The flash is pop-up, and it works okay. I have noticed it tends to be a bit too powerful at close range, but that's a problem with many point and shoots. The body itself is a tad on the bulky/large side for a point and shoot, but by no means unmanageable and still a lot smaller and lighter than most mirrorless cameras. It has button controls that can perform all functions alongside the touchscreen. The camera charges via micro-USB input and comes with an AC adapter. It uses full size SD, not micro-SD like the DV300F. It has built-in wi-fi for sharing pictures, and also shoots excellent full HD (1080) video.I got this on sale for $100 and at that price I'd heartily recommend this camera for anyone looking for a point and shoot. Even at MSRP, it's easy to recommend due to the big pluses: excellent zoom, wi-fi enabled, and convenient touch control that it doesn't force you to use. The zoom in particular makes this camera 'useful,' in the sense that it's a lot better than any cellphone camera. On the downside, it is a bit bulky (though not heavy) for a point and shoot- many of the other options out there are a lot more pocketable. I also know from previous experience that the zoom mechanism is fragile- be very careful when handling it and don't put any pressure on it. Lastly, battery life is so-so (no small wonder, you'll probably be amazed by how tiny the battery is). To some degree this is an issue with all EVF cameras, but this one (and it seems, most Samsung cameras in general) seem a bit worse than average. It's not terrible, but you may need to charge on the go if you're planning to use it all day. The good news in that regard is there's an abundance of external battery packs out there that you can easily use to charge the unit without an outlet.", "Date": "December 22, 2013"}, {"Title": "A very satisfied customer!", "Author": "Rose Gonzalez", "ReviewID": "RAII47LI52FZ9", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I chose this rating because it's what I have been looking for.

I am happy to say that this camera performed very well during a recent trip that included beaches, sand, rain, mist, waterfalls, low light and occasional bumps.The Samsung WB250F's body is metallic. This is a definite plus because the camera feels much more sturdier and is much more durable than its plastic body cousins. I find its grip to be more than sufficient as well. In fact, there is a small thumb rest positioned on the rear of the camera. Besides having a CMOS sensor, one of the main selling points of this camera is definitely its zoom capability. I have to point out that it zooms slower than a snail crossing a road when recording video. I believe there is a setting to make this camera zoom faster, although you will sacrifice zoom speed with motor noise. I did not find zooming during video to be too much of an issue because I mainly used this camera to take photos with.This camera's zoom capability is a good selling point (as I mentioned in the last paragraph). To me, the zoom seems crisp and is exceptional in many situations. I have bumped this camera's body and I have even bumped its extended barrel. After such treatment, the camera still did its duty and worked for me. There were also other elemental conditions in which this camera was exposed to. I have taken photos in many situations (including situations with high humidity) and this camera has performed flawlessly. I didn't notice any difference in shutter speeds or processing times in adverse environments. The battery life is pretty good as well. Although there is no information on battery life, the battery that this camera uses seems to last a long time before needing to be recharged.There are more great things about this camera (such as touch screen and WiFi), but I chose to write this review based on the camera's capabilities as a camera.

Will probably go back to my $99  6 year old little pocket Sony.  Almost impossible to not get blurred photos if any motion at all is involved!  The zoom mechanism is jerky and time-consuming to focus and oddly placed; NO manual comes with it and I shouldnt have to download a 40 page document to find out how to work the dang thing.

My 10 year old Olympus was great.  I bought this camera to make it easier to transfer photos and videos to cloud storage.  It is completely inept at this.  WiFi direct is incredibly erratic, you have to reestablish the link almost every time.  The smartphone app is horrible and also erratic.  I am using a Galaxy S3, you would think this would be a natural communication.  Also, Samsung tech support has been absolutely awful.

Truly if there were minus stars this would be a good time to use them. Clumsy lay out ugly piece of plastic looks like it came freshly printed out of a cheap 3-D printer. Underlined by a plastic bullet screw mount that surely won't survive more than a couple of weeks.  Horrible image quality barely living up to the camera of a high class smart phone, flat washed out colours, mostly overexposed and almost never sharp. The highly praised WiFi capability is very slow often not working at all and to make matters worse every time you want to use it, lose the connection (happens about every five minutes) or simply have closed the app and want to go into it again you have to go through the entire cumbersome connection process. I promise you will be so happy that the camera came with a USB cable to use instead. You are much better of, infect it works twice as good, to buy yourself a WiFi SD card.If you still can't help yourself and really have to buy this camera at least choose it in white you may be lucky leaving it on your fridge one day to never see it again and if you belong to the unlucky ones like me that bought that piece of *#$$ already just use it as a sinker on your next fishing trip.", "Date": "July 5, 2013"}], "ProductInfo": {"Price": "$249.99", "Features": "Capture Detailed Images in Low Light situations with a 14PM BSI CMOS Sensor\nShare your Best Photos Instantly with Family and Friends with Built-in Wi-Fi\n18x Optical Zoom\n3.0 TFT LCD Screen\nSamsung color designation is \"Cobalt Black\".
