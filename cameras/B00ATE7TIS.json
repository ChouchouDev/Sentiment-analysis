{"Reviews": [{"Title": "We are very happy with this camera", "Author": "Contrarian", "ReviewID": "R1W1V96CF8MGWT", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I just bought this for my wife. It is a very nice compact camera. I read the reviews carefully for a number of compact models on Amazon, Cnet and elsewhere. Panasonic seemed the best in this category so I went with the recent model. We are very happy we did. We are happy with Canon for larger, more serious cameras but for compacts Panasonic seems best. This is certainly better than the Canon it replaced.The response time to click and shoot is very short compared to other compact cameras we have had. The picture quality seems excellent in \"Intelligent Auto\". It is flexible if you want to customize your shots with several built-in photo types and also freedom to adjust yourself. The 10X optical zoom is very good, too. [Note: goes to 20X with \"digital zoom\". Pictures look fine but I think it is more meaningful to compare the optical zoom. 10X is very good for a camera this small.]The only thing that we have any trouble with is the \"panoramic\" feature that stitches several pictures into one wide one. It is not a feature very important to us the but the couple of times I have tried it I had trouble getting it to work. It said they camera was not moved horizontally enough to work.Other than that, it is very easy to use. The buttons are well-located and the menus are clear and easy to navigate. Overall, we are very happy with this camera.", "Date": "June 11, 2013"}, {"Title": "Simple to use, takes \"OK\" photos - Panasonic SZ3", "Author": "Yarii", "ReviewID": "R3E68FLRAMAW93", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "Although I love the styling of the new XS1 Panasonic camera Panasonic Lumix XS1 16.1 MP Compact Digital Camera with 8x Intelligent Zoom (White) and came close to ordering that model, I chose the SZ3 instead. The reason I chose this camera instead? The XS1 uses a micro-SD card, those little tiny cards smaller than a fingernail that are normally used in cell phones (and some Samsung cameras!). Since I like to remove my SDHC card to get my photos off via a card reader, I chose the SZ3 instead since it uses the normal SDHC card. I recommend getting a Class 10 card for this if you plan on shooting videos.Even though this has a CCD sensor instead of the newer CMOS sensor found on more & more cameras nowadays, I can't see much difference in speed. It is quick to turn on and be ready for a photo, quick to recycle after taking a photo, burst speed is fast enough to keep me happy.Photos are true to color, although similar to other Panasonic cameras, a little \"soft\". This can be remedied by keeping your setting on Vivid (normal setting) to increase sharpness. This has a Leica lens, known for being one of the best lenses available.Plenty of scene settings, even for pets. Most of the time though, I can get a better pet photo with the setting iA (Intelligent Auto mode).A *major* disappointment is the lack of the Quick Access Menu button as other Panasonic cameras have. It also falls a little short on macro shots. I get better close-ups with some of my other cameras; at the same time, those cameras cost more.Low light: No matter what the camera manufacturers say, not only Panasonic, but the others, you can't expect a camera in this price range to be good in low light. It's just not gonna happen. Now if you're in a dimly-lit restaurant and use a night scene setting with the flash, yes, you'll get a decent photo, but if you expect anything more, you'll be disappointed. In that case you need a camera 4 to 5 times the price of this one such as the Sony RX100.I love the Creative Control options with this camera, this seems to have more options than some of the other camera models. My friends and I are having a blast with the \"Beauty Retouch\" function! You can retouch a photo to give yourself a more glamorous look, even a smokey eye!Battery life is decent, I can get around 200 photos and a couple videos before the battery needs recharged. As far as recharging, the battery is charged INSIDE the camera like a lot of others these days. You can charge it by your PC or by plugging the cord into a receptacle.Build quality: It's plastic, but seems to be durable for a cheap camera. No matter how much one spends on a camera, the battery doors are always flimsy, so just take extra care when opening it. This camera is on the smaller side, but not \"too small\" and the controls/menus are easy to access even with chubby fingers. The LCD screen is a tad smaller than most, but seems to not have as much glare in the sun. One downside is this camera is made in China, while most of my other Panasonic cameras were made in Japan, even those that were similar in price.As far as video, some may think it's a \"con\" that this only records 720p, not 1080p. Frankly, I can't tell much difference between the two when I view them on my computer on YouTube, however, you may see a small difference if you watch the video on a TV. My computer is 5 years old and doesn't handle 1080p very well, it's a little quirky.I recommend this camera, even though it's a basic point & shoot with very little manual control. Sometimes I favor ease-of-use and the ability to easily carry a camera rather than carry around a heavy one. This camera fits inside my smallest purses. It's simple to use, takes good photos and it's a good price. I bought it in white (I have a thing for white cameras!) the back is charcoal gray though. It's stunning and you'd think white would show dirt more than the other colors, that doesn't seem to be the case here.", "Date": "June 5, 2013"}, {"Title": "Great small camera and sharp lens at a very reasonable price!", "Author": "Amazonian Consumer", "ReviewID": "R3MNTT7VHXMY43", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "Currently, the Lumix SZ3 is the lowest priced Panasonic Point-and-Shoot digital camera that comes with a Leica-licensed lens. And the DSC-W730 is the lowest priced Sony that comes with a Carl Zeiss-licensed lens. Leica and Carl Zeiss are legendary German photographic lens designers who are known for their super sharp and accurate color lenses. Not all Sony and Panasonic cameras have Carl Zeiss and Leica marking on the lens, respectively. Those that do not cost less, but I always choose ones that do.I have both of the above cameras and like them very much because they take excellent, sharp, color accurate pictures without costing a lot of money. The Panasonic costs a bit more, but both are excellent.The Lumix SZ3 has a slightly greater zoom range of 10X, compared to Sony's 8X. Both cameras have the wide end of the zoom lens at 25mm (35mm film camera lens equivalent), which is great for group and scenery shots.I prefer the SZ3 camera's physical user interface, especially the direct \"movie button\" and the shutter button surrounded zoom lever. They are more convenient and easier to use than Sony's.The SZ3 shoots video in 720p at 24 frames per second (fps). Some users like this frame rate because the resulting video looks more film-like, or movie-like than when shot at 30 fps or higher.I buy extra compatible batteries on eBay. For the SZ3, you can typically get 2 new batteries, with free shipping, for about $13. Just search \"Panasonic SZ3 battery\".The black version of the SZ3 also comes equipped with a black-colored lens barrel - a rarity these days. IMHO, it makes the whole camera look better/more consistent.If you need a carrying pouch for this camera, I'd recommend Case Logic's DCB-302 (less than $6) Case Logic DCB-302 Compact  Case for Camera - Black. Its size is just right for the SZ3, with a few centimeters of extra space so it isn't too snug. The small accessories pocket is perfect for memory cards and batteries.Instead of using the pouch's shoulder strap, I urge you to tie the camera's wrist strap to one of the two shoulder strap ringlets, so that the camera and the case are loosely tied together. The arrangement permits me to hold the case with my left hand while I take pictures with my right hand. If someone bumps into me at this moment, my camera is less likely to fall to the ground, as its wrist strap is tied to the case held by my left hand.", "Date": "September 28, 2013"}, {"Title": "Great performer - lots of artistic options in camera", "Author": "shutterbug33", "ReviewID": "R2KHYQH662UOCB", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I have a DSLR.

Each photograph, especially those where I've aimed into any kind of light source, have hazy white lines in the center of the photo. I couldn't figure out how I could have scratched the lens since the cover retracts automatically when it's not on. I am very careful with my camera and keep it in a lens case when being carried around. A little research turned this up: http://www.amazon.co.uk/Lens-scratches/forum/Fx39Y385WF8RDUQ/Tx1ZBKB3Z7Z73R8/1?_encoding=UTF8&asin;=B001T0H0RG. Apparently lots of other people have had this this issue. The scratches are due to a defect in the camera shutter which scratches the lens each time it closes. When I listen closely I can hear it making contact with the glass. I called Panasonic and spoke to Otis, a supervisor in their Camera Repair dept. and, as expected, he told me that I'd have to return it for repair at a cost of $128. He said \"defect or not, it's out of warranty\". And that's that. I will not be returning it for repair at that cost, of course.

At the time I was a little skeptical of a camera made by an electronics manufacturer, but from the beginning Panasonic has partnered with Leica (which is why I bought the first one, and this one, my 4th.  Honestly, this was not necessary. There are... quite a few cameras in the house. including some very good ones (one of the FZ bridge cameras, an Olympus Pen and 4 more Panasonics and then some).so why did I buy this?  They say it is the camera you have on hand, and because of it's size, the Panasonic FP3 Panasonic Lumix DMC-FP3 14.1 MP Digital Camera with 4x Optical Image Stabilized Zoom and 3.0-Inch Touch-Screen LCD (Red) is usually that camera.  It is a great little camera. I lOVE the touch screen! but it only has a 4x zoom and no wide angle.  I am writing this review primarily because of how impressed I am be the difference the lens has made (the FP3 is the only  one of my Panasonics which has a lumix lens).  The price Amazon is selling this for is astonishing! The lens alone could easily cost that much! so now  I have another amazing pocket size camera. I think my FP3 is going to get jealous, because the image quality on this one is so nice, it will be the one in my purse. or pocket.  I have only played with it  day or 2 but am just floored by the image quality, color rendition.It is a very simple camera, point and shoot. You will not get all the manual features you get on micro 2/3rds e.g. but it is simple and intuitive, shoots high quality video and stills, has noise and shake reduction. It is an almost fool-proof camera with an amazing lens, at an amazing price point.The build quality is not quite up to the other Pansonics. it has a fiddley door (similar to those on cell phones) covering the usb port. But really, a camera is a lens in a box. Never has that been clearer than when holding this camera.  he lens is amazing, and the rest of it is also pretty good.  I sincerely doubt it is possible to get a better camera for under $100 and if there is one, I would like to see it ;)I will have to edit to add a link, but I want to point out that Amazon has some wonderful leather cases in overstock at an even more amazing price which fit this camera perfectly!!

I didn't want to spend more than $200 on one and I wanted one with a fairly good zoom.  Everything I researched kept bringing me back to this camera.  At the time there were only about 10 ratings on it but they were mostly positive.  Here's what I've found with it and I've had it for almost 7 months now:Good:-It takes nice sharp landscape pics without zoom just fine-It has a wide angle, unlike most cameras of this size (which can be good and bad)-The panoramic is awesome and does a very good job of stitching-Battery life is ok, not fantastic-It is small and easy to carry-It's been reliable, had no issues with it except recently with a spot on the lens which I just tried cleaning last night and haven't tested today-Easy to navigate the menus-Has enough creative controls to keep you happy-Video quality is ok but if you walk around with it, it will be shaky and zooming takes a long time.Bad:-The zoom is horrible.  At full zoom the pictures are completely grainy.-Image stabilization?  None here.-You can't zoom in on anything that's close to you without it being blurry.  You have to get the camera right up next to the thing you want to photograph and even then, it's not guaranteed it will be out of focus.-It's hard to tell on the preview if your photo is blurry or not without zooming in on it.-The microphone is in a horrible place for shooting video.  It's right where you hold the camera so I often find I can't hear anything because my finger was covering it.-I have to take the videos into Free All Converter before posting it on YouTube due to the incompatibility...that's horrible.-Night time pictures simply don't come out...they are completely dark and grainy if not using the flash.

Crisp, sharp photos (and videos) with no blurr2. ease of use; very intuitive with a lot of features3. The zoom is excellent4. panarama mode is highly improvedI owned a coolpix compact for years, and the battery latch broke so went to replace; but from readings and hands on investigation, decided on the Lumix sz3.  The Lumix is a much better product [remember comparing older tech however; the Coolpix was only 6 megapixels], as the coolpix was a solid no frills 'auto' device, but this Lumix is a sophisticated machine offering both simplicity and functionality...and some override for manual control for real photo buffs.  And the ZOOM is superlative.  The zoom reminds me of my old 35 mm SLR film system telephoto lens etc.  Amazing now we have this at the touch of our fingertips on small pocket sized cameras like this Lumix.  The coolpix I thought was nearly indestructible until that latch broke but only after years of use and abuse.  We'll see if that Lumix holds up as well, or better.  For now, I feel really good about this purchase and really like this camera [the Lumix].", "Date": "July 6, 2013"}, {"Title": "DO NOT BUY PANASONIC!", "Author": "suzannell", "ReviewID": "R2H5TYV2SO8H7R", "Overall": "1.0", "Content": "I ordered a camera from them and it quickly had a system error and would not function.

I bought this one because it has even greater zoom capacity, and produces very sharp images with the Leica lens. I use these cameras to do field work, and often have to shoot from some distance. They are capable of retaining a high degree of detail. I would warn that the lens protection does have a tendency to get dust in it. This can lead to jamming, with e zoom becoming inoperable. So it is important to keep the camera in a case when it is not in use. I have shot thousands of frames on these cameras, and find they do stand up to repeated use. The durability, quality of picture, the compact size, and the cost make the Panasonic Lumix DMC-SZ3 a really great tool in the arsenal of folks doing field work.

This replacement is much better than the old one I lost.I am updating my review of the SZ3 I got after 2 months of use. The former Lumix which I lost was found and I got to compare the picture quality of the 2 Lumix I have now; i.e., the FS7 with 10MP and the 16MP SZ3. In order to be fair in the comparison I set the two camera on the same resolution. When I set the two cameras at 5 MP resolution, the old FS7 would consistently take pictures that are a lot more clearer than the SZ3 with outdoors, indoors, with or without flash. I also noticed that the FS7 can take better shot in low light situations compared to the SZ3, though I wouldn't say that the FS7 is a good camera for low light situations at all but it still has better handling of low light than the newer model. There's a lot of noise in the shots of SZ3 compared to shots taken with same resolution by the Lumix FS7 and my sister's Sony Cybershot DSC H10. After these tests, and solid first hand evidence of various trials, I now think that the SZ3 I have is not a good one at all. I am just not sure of whether the one I have is representative of the normal quality of an average SZ3 or I was just unlucky to get a bad one. Having said so, I am changing my rating for this camera from 5 stars to 2 stars for poor picture quality. I tried different settings on this camera but I couldn't get it to take sharp, noise free pictures consistently. I am so disappointed with this camera.

I purchased this camera based on the reviews given on Amazon.  It seemed to have alot of positive reviews, so I went forward and purchased the item.  I have owned a Panasonic lumix point and shoot, for many years now, and decided to upgrade.  I currently have a 7mp camera, (from 2006) and wanted to upgrade to 16 mp or higher.  I purchased this camera, and when I first tried this camera out, the images gave off a weird distortion & slight blurriness of images.  I thought to myself, o.k. let me go back and read the instructions again. So, after reading and playing around with the features I was still getting a blurriness and distortion in my images.  Some images were even showing a type of noise or spots in background.  So, I figured I was doing something wrong.  I called up Panasonic customer support.  Well, after being on the phone for over an hour an half, the customer support agent said that I could return the camera for another one or return the item to the store.  So, obviously I asked the customer agent if that verifies there was something seriously wrong with the camera.  They couldn't verify, what was wrong with camera.  So, I returned the camera back to the store and got my money back.WHAT I REALLY NEEDED THIS CAMERA FOR:  I only needed the camera to take images of merchandise, inside my house, in low light settings primarily for my online eCommerce stores on amazon & ebay.  Apparently, doing this simple task was too much for this camera.  I personally didn't try taking images outside.So, in final it was disappointing.  I was a huge fan of Panasonic and I guess you get what you pay for... But, I just can't see spending $1000+ for a camera to take simple images indoors.

This camera does not follow in the Lumix tradition.The images are soft and lack contrast.  My former, Lumix Model DMC-FS15, puts this camera to shame in both areas.The other thing that should be disclosed on your website in big bold letters is that there is no external charger provided.  You have to charge the battery while it is in your camera.If you are concerned about sharp, saturated images and the convenience of being able to charge your battery while it isn't in the camera, look for another camera.P.S.  If you so buy one, don't go near the internal \"retouch\" setting on this camera.  All it does is blend adjoining pixels and turn the images to \"mush\" trying to hide the wrinkles in your subjects.", "Date": "November 4, 2013"}, {"Title": "defective usb adaptor", "Author": "Ricardo N", "ReviewID": "REJF9TBHK0XET", "Overall": "1.0", "Content": "Great point-and shoot camera.

However when I took it home and plugged it to the wall adapter I got the same error light (and failure to charge) as with the previous camera.
