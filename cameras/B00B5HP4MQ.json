With the firmware upgrade the focusing is slightly slow, slightly, almost to the point that it doesn't matter. Absolutely great for available light photos with the 22 prime. It is jacket pocketable but not pants. And never with the zoom lens. But with a full size sensor and DLSR low light performance it is a take with camera when anything bigger doesn't work. The new M2 is an upgrade, but for the price this is a steal. My dSLR with a super wide zoom, standard lens and long Tele zoom will be sitting in the bag waiting for the next safari.", "Date": "December 4, 2013"}], "ProductInfo": {"Price": "$1,299.99", "Features": "18.0 MP CMOS (APS-C) Sensor, ISO 100-12800, Expandable to 25600 (H)\nFull HD 1080p Movie with Focus Tracking, Scene Intelligent Auto\n3.0\" Touch Screen LCD with 1040K-dots, Touch AF and Multi-touch Operation\nHybrid CMOS Auto-focus for Photo & Video, DIGIC 5 Image Processor\nIncludes EF-M 18-55mm f/3.5-5.6 Lens, EF-M 22mm STM Lens and Speedlite 90EX Flash , Compatible with Canon EF and EF-S Lenses", "Name": "Canon EOS M 18.0 MP Compact Systems Camera with EF-M18-55mm IS, 22mm f/2 STM Lens and Speedlite 90EX Flash Black", "ImgURL": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/51PVZcuJbvL._SY300_.jpg", "ProductID": "B00B5HP4MQ"}}
