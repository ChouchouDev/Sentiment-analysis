It takes a beating and is still working great.  It takes awesome photos during the day and at night.  We haven't hat a chance to test it out to see how waterproof it is yet but just give my son time!  Our only complaint is that it is not the best for action photos.  All in all a good first camera.", "Date": "August 23, 2013"}], "ProductInfo": {"Price": null, "Features": null, "Name": null, "ImgURL": null, "ProductID": "B00AAZSCNM"}}
