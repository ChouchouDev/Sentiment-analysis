Some of the extras in the package are very usefull such as the memory card, various cords, and the camera bag.  My camera bag was defective and DavisMAX sent a new one out immediately.  I found there attention to this matter was great.  The flash and tripod are substandard, but I knew this would be the case and my decision to purchase the package was based on the camera and one of the lenses.  I would have paid more for a good flash and tripod though.  I will shop at Davis MAX again if I see a product of value", "Date": "March 15, 2014"}, {"Title": "Great company!", "Author": "Derica Wilson", "ReviewID": "R3M6O08GX9VHII", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "Everything was great!
