{"Reviews": [{"Title": "Good Camera, But Not Great", "Author": "NatNapoletano", "ReviewID": "R25PO85OWZX8RH", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "Review of Nikon Coolpix P520 by Nat NapoletanoEverything is relative so I will be comparing Nikon's Coolpix P250 to its main competitor the Canon SX50 (they sell for the same price).WHAT NIKON DID RIGHT:Under ideal conditions, the 18.1 megapixel Nikon creates images with higher resolution than the Canon. My images shot at a resolution chart showed that the Nikon had a real resolution of about 12 megapixels (18.1 advertized) and the cannon resolved about 9 megapixels (12 advertized). But under actual conditions, in daylight, they both perform about the same because the Canon has a much better lens. When zoomed or at in high contrast situations, the Nikon makes larger files that are not as clear and sharp as the Canon and have some purple fringing around the edges when blown up.The image sensor in the Nikon is a newer technology and really does perform much better in low light.Nikon has a timer feature that I have found on no other camera. You can set it up to start snapping pictures every 30 seconds, or 1 minute or 5 minutes. This is very cool, you can set it on a tripod and take nature shots all night waiting for a deer to come eat your corn, or you can put together a time laps movie from the frames, or set it up to catch violators in the act. The possibilities are huge! Other cameras, including the Canon, won't do this. (and it would have been so easy in their software)The viewing screen is big and bright. The best I've seen and much better than the Canon.Nikon has a built in GPS. I didn't test it; I'll never use it. Canon doesn't have this feature.WHAT NIKON DID WRONG:The Nikon has focus problems when using the self timer and in movie mode. If you start the movie recording, and then step in front of the camera, it mostly focuses on the back wall and your face is fuzzy. The camera never seems to recover. This is very bad (come on Nikon). I have tried every combination of focus modes. Face detect doesn't seem to work after the movie is recording. I never had a camera this bad. You are forced to use manual focus. This problem does not affect traditional movie recording, focus works fine when you are behind the camera shooting a subject in front of you.In order to use Nikon's electronic viewfinder, you need to fold and tuck the flip out screen. This is a big nuisance on a sunny day going back and forth. Every other camera in the world changes displays using the display button; the Canon does. (and it would have been so easy to implement in Nikon's software, the button is already there)The Nikon camera feels cheap. The lens rattles (but doesn't exhibit any problems) and the flip screen doesn't lock in place. The Canon feels solid as a rock.The charging system that ships with the Nikon uses a cable that charges the battery in the camera. This is a nuisance and I don't need another charging unit with a cord to get tangled in the drawer. So you have to fork out another $30 or$ 40 for a charger and spare battery. The Canon ships with a nice charger that plugs into the wall and holds the battery.All outdoor images are slightly overexposed. This can be corrected by bumping down the aperture 2 stops when shooting, but what was Nikon thinking. The Canon is right on the mark.WHAT CANON DID RIGHT:The Canon super zoom is much more powerful, 50X vs 42X. The Canon lens is truly remarkable. You can photograph the moons of Jupiter on a clear night. I tested it next to the Nikon on distant road signs and you could read text from a mile away using the Canon. There was no comparison. The Nikon doesn't have the range and the image was a little fuzzy at the longest extent compared Canon's superior optics.", "Date": "April 19, 2013"}, {"Title": "Pretty good but not 'great'. 24mm-1,000mm lens, Wi-Fi & GPS but no RAW.", "Author": "D. Graves \"Fine Books and More\"", "ReviewID": "RV2240X5XC0G4", "Overall": "3.0", "Content": "For the price, this is a good camera. Not a \"great\" camera, but a fairly good one. I would consider it high end for the average consumer, with features superior to other point-and-shoots in its price range: Wi-fi capable (ability to connect to iOS and Android devices for viewing/sharing your photos and videos via the optional WU-1a adapter), built-in GPS (to geotag your photos), 18MP CMOS sensor, a zoom lens with incredible focal range (24mm-1,000mm), and 1080 HD video. For the price, that's a nice set-up, a camera with advanced features with a decent ease-of-use, requiring little knowledge of photographic techniques.Many of us, however, want to go beyond 'picture-taking' and seek an advanced camera that is not in an advanced price range. And this is where the P520 is attractive but, ultimately, falls a bit short of our desires. For example, there's no RAW: your images are captured in JPEG only. There's a decent pop-up flash but no hot shoe. Also, the impressive zoom is not so impressive with regard to its speed, either its lens speed (f/3.0-5.9) or autofocus speed (fairly slow but not quite horrible). However, it is a nice, glass, Nikkor lens; and, to be fair, it would be quite a feat to bring such a long zoom well under f/3, given the price range. Personally, I would have traded focal length for speed: yes, it's impressive to go out to 1000mm, but I would have taken 800mm with an f/2.8-5.0 lens; though Nikon has built-in stabilization features for both photos and video (called 'Active VR mode' for video), you're not going to do hand-held shots at that 1000mm focal length, especially video.Other aspects of the camera will please everyone: full manual exposure control along with multiple auto/semi-auto exposure modes, a nice and large tilting Vari-Angle LCD monitor, an excellent CMOS sensor (1/2.3 in.), and a nice weight and feel to the body. This last point is what drew me to the 520 in the first place: I just bought a P310 and although I love it, especially for its small size and portability (shirt pocket), I cannot get used to shooting outdoors with such a small camera. The 520 is just perfect; that solid DSLR feel but with a modest weight (20 ounces).Yes, I wish the P520 had a few more pro-like features and wasn't so extreme in its focal length, but this is a very good camera overall. I'm giving it 3 stars for the reasons stated above. However, if you're someone not interested in advanced photography and just want a very nice camera with higher-end consumer features, this is a borderline 4-star camera and not bad for the price.", "Date": "February 25, 2013"}, {"Title": "Nikon P520 Coolpix Camera Dark Gray body (or silver to some)", "Author": "E. Simonson", "ReviewID": "R2O3QX9JESNMG", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "Did a lot of research and read reviews as well as YouTube about this camera. Mostly very good comments.Now that I have used this camera for a couple weeks I can say that I made a good decision in purchasing it.I get all the manual control that I had on my old SLR camera,but with this camera it is a lot easier to use and do the the manual settings that I like.One feature I wished it had is Stop Down Metering, I have found no camera of this type that offers this feature either so I didn't mark it down for this.My pictures are very good and the video (which was not the reason I bought this camera) works great even at max zoom of 1000mm which allowed me to get fantastic videos at a recent outdoor concert, as long as I had good lighting the focusing worked great and was pretty fast.The zoom works good and very smooth, the VR (Vibration Reduction) works way better than I imagined at the long Zoom range.I have read some folks wished there was a button to switch between the EVF and the main viewing screen but I like the fact that when I fold the large view screen flat in it's storage area the EVF comes on automatically and when I unfold the large viewing screen it comes on automatically so I have no extra buttons to push.I was concerned about the focusing of this camera as some have mentioned in that it sometimes will not focus sharply.Now that I have this camera and am using it I have found that if I press down the shutter quickly I will sometimes get out of focus photos, but when I press the shutter button part way down (or maybe slowly) the camera has more time to get the correct focus?I have found this seems to be the best method for sharp photos and I have not had any problems since.The Nikon P520 menu system only took me about an hour to make all the settings that I prefer to use which I felt was very easy.Most of all I really like the looks of this camera, it feels great in my hands, very comfortable and not too heavy.The battery last longer than what I was expecting even with using fill flash for many of my sunny outdoor photos, so I can't complain about the battery life.Comes with everything needed to copy photos from the camera to the PC and charging the battery.Same cord that I use to charge the camera battery also copies the photos to the PC as you can remove the AC connector and use the USB end to connect to the PC.The only gripe I have is that there are no threads in the lens barrel to attach a filter to protect the lens glass, for a camera of this type that should be a no brainer.I have ordered a slip on adapter kit for this camera that is threaded at one end for adding filters (the kit also comes with 3 filters), I will see how this works and report on this later.All in all I am enjoying taking photos with this camera, I find myself looking for any reason to go out picture taking, this camera is really fun and I highly recommend it. The price was very fair on Amazon.UPDATE ON THE LENS ADAPTER.I received the lens adapter with 3 filters and one of them being a polarizing filter.The adapter is a hard plastic and slips over the outside of the camera lens barrel, fits nice and tight.There is a small recess in the adapter so that it will only let you push the adapter on to the camera lens just a 1/4 inch so this is really nice and very easy to put on the camera lens, feels very snug and firm.The adapter is threaded on one end where you would screw on the filters, this feels really secure and works well.So I can say that I'm very happy with the lens adapter and the filters it comes with. So far so good.", "Date": "August 20, 2013"}, {"Title": "Review for the Average Camera buyer without all the Bells & Whistles", "Author": "Brad", "ReviewID": "RJFP0EJ5QTOFK", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "Ill start by saying I really dont know much about Cameras. Im just the average Husband whos Wife has been saying for the last couple years that she would love a new Camera. So this Christmas Ive decided to take the jump and buy her this Nikon P520. Now I sat here like most of you are doing reading reviews and after about an hour I realized I still didnt know anything. It seems like a good Camera but then there are the bad reviews also. So I decided to contact an Old Friend that I hadnt spoken to in years who actually is a pretty well knowledged person at one of the Top Camera Companies that you see all the time. After sending him the link to this camera we went back and forth and he explained  all the bells and whistles that this Camera had and also explained the pros and cons. What I came to realize after a couple days and alot of emails was I still really didnt know much about this Camera. So I left him with 2 last questions. 1) Is this Camera worth the money and 2) Is this Camera a Camera that you yourself with all your Camera Knowledge would actually purchase and enjoy. His answer to both of those questions was a very strong YES. Now thats what I needed. I just wanted to hear from someone who knew all the bells and whistles that it would be a Camera he would trust to take the pictures of his life. So I bought this Camera and without going on and on anymore then I already have I can tell you it was the best decision Ive made in a long time. Of course I gave it to her early so by Christmas we would know what we were doing. The pictures are Vivid and Vibrant. 2 words Ive never used in my life. Its easy enough to use for a guy like me but at the same time is capable of keeping the avid photographer happy with all the things its capable of doing. So after all this I would say yes, buy this Camera. We havent had one issue with it at all and it really seems like we made a good choice. Hope this helps the average Camera Buyer a little more then all the other head spinning reviews I sat and read for Hours.", "Date": "December 9, 2013"}, {"Title": "Great Trade Off", "Author": "P.

But, when I go on trips and I am concerned about getting a picture quick I only take my Coolpix P520. The controls and capabilities on this camera have produced some marvelous pictures. And, rather than trying to figure which lens to use and changing out lens, I am able to take the fleeting picture. Sure the Coolpix P520 isn't my Nikon D3. But, it certainly does take some very pleasing pictures. In fact,one of my pictures taken by the Coolpix P520 that was posted on line was even chosen as a \"favorite\" by a professional photographer. To say the least he was quite surprised when he noticed what camera I used. Sure the Coolpix P520 has its limits when you compare it to a DSLR like my D3.

It did not take perfectly clear pictures but the camera was complex enough that I thought that it was my problem.  I bought the Photographer's Guide to the Nikon Coolpix P520 by Alexander S. White and I would recommend it as useful to anyone who buys this camera.However, even after working with the manual, trying different settings, autofocus, program, different focus patterns, manual focus, etc. the camera still did not take crisp, clear pictures. It was a disappointment. I did note though that the video camera function seemed to work quite well and actually focus better than the still picture mode.I was able to use a software program and sharpen the pictures and improve them, but they still were not crystal clear.  I compared them to an older Fuji Finepix that I have that is 6MP and has a total 19X zoom. Most of the time whatever it can physically include in its field it can take pictures of clearly.  And the macro is very good, better than this Nikon 520.  Speaking of the 18.1 MP rating of the Nikon, I have found that 6MP make very clear prints on an 8 1/2 x 11 sheet of photography paper and don't see the need for such high MP values.I'm not saying I'm the final word on this camera. There are many that like this camera, and have had success with it.

In these situations, no combination of controls including Power On/Off will unlock -- you must open the battery door, and physically remove and replace the battery.Short Battery Life: The P520 will unpredictably, and very quickly, run out of power; and IT CANNOT BE RECHARGED WHILE POWERED ON.  This means that any sort of time-lapse photography is out of the question. Nikon must come up with better power-management software, and/or higher-capacity batteries -- and provide for live charging.Ergonomics: The method of switching display between the LED and the eyepiece is clumsy at best.The menus are also seriously in need of work!Outdoor overexposure: The P520 does not handle daylight well, and even with flash does not handle backlit scenes as well as my other Nikons, or Kodaks.The GPS: Software is flaky and hard to manage -- this feature set must be reworked.Will I try another Nikon soon?I suppose so -- but this one really leaves me wondering if the Nikon people care about the quality of their software!Come on Nikon, step up to making a quality product before you release it to the consumers!", "Date": "August 17, 2013"}, {"Title": "Very nice camera, takes great pictures", "Author": "L. Hinrichsen", "ReviewID": "R2CXVFDBMOEPGW", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "This camera has been perfect for me. I'm just an everyday user and the camera is easy to figure out, and takes good quality zoom pictures.The camera is lightweight. The zoom lens is integrated, unlike the DSLRs that have removable, heavy, lenses. This also means there's less chance of dirt or moisture getting in there. The lens is versatile and I'm loving the 42x zoom.I like that you can flip and tilt the LCD viewing screen. You can flip the screen out and turn it all the way around so the person being videotaped can see themselves.  You can also hold the camera high above your head, or way off to the side, and tilt the screen so you can still see the subject of your photo/video. I like that you can fully close the LCD facing the camera to protect it, or close and keep the LCD facing outwards - whatever your preference. I put a clear protective film on my LCD screen.I didn't realize the camera doesn't come with a battery charger! Duh! You have to plug the camera into an outlet to charge the battery inside. Make sure you buy a charger with at least a couple of extra batteries.I was very confused that this and other comparable cameras didn't have Image Stabilization, especially with such a powerful zoom lens.

Sims \"m.sims\"", "ReviewID": "R1VVDEL2NV0XTF", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "I was in the market for a new digital camera and started out looking at entry level SLR's but after reading great reviews about the Canon Rebel T3i, I got to thinking about searching for camera that have some of the benefits but that are present in a mega zoom camera.  My last three camera's are all Panasonic Lumix's and I was looking there but did not see the sense in going from a 20 optical zoom to a 24.  So I narrowed it down to the Canon Sx50 based on reviews and youtube videos.Well after doing my diligent research on the web, starting here of course, I always go into local stores and test drive these babies to see how I feel about it, and although the Canon is a great camera, it's not like I really needed a new camera, I just wanted one.  I stumbled into HHGregg and while looking, I noticed the Nikon and thought.... thats a real low price for that type of camera.It looks a lot like the Canon with the pivoting swing out LCD screen but it was priced like $160 less than it sells for. Someone had mis-priced it on the floor.  I had not heard of the camera before and knew nothing about it.  So once the manager agreed to sell it to me for the incorrect price, I got comfortable, whipped out my cell phone and came here and started reading reviews.  YES, I still needed to do my research.  I purchased the camera!  Here is my take after having it for a couple of days:Pros:- Great pics- Has wi-fi enabled feature (that's next for me to try out once I get the adapter) It only works on Apple and Android phones I have read.- Has GPS (although I opted not to turn that on to save battery life, but I guess I should test it)- Great feel with the rubber handle grip.  I found it very sturdy.- I love the LCD flip out monitor.  You can do so many things with it, and it's only available in a few models in this price range.- Similar to the Canon Sx50 but cheaperCons:- It is not a out the box point n shoot camera.  I had to tweak it in the \"P\" mode and selected AF-F (Full-time AF) to get clearer pics on zoom (Thx for great customer service Nikon)- It makes more noise when engaging the zoom than I like.  I was told by CS to return it for an exchange and I plan to do that tomorrow.  However, I'm not sure if this is just the way they are. Will see....- It is not a clear shot camera, you will need to wait a sec for it to autofocus which can cost you quick shots in a pinch or pics maybe being fuzzy.That being said, it is still a great camera, especially since I got it new at such a reduced amount due to in-store pricing error.  I didn't want to pay the $450 in the store for the Canon and with the mispriced Nikon since I did not have to.  It does not have the same extended zoom as the Canon camera but long is never enough, if you can get longer I guess.  (Amazon.com sells the Canon for $369 right now. )I've taken some really awesome pics both indoors and outside, but price being equal, I would suggest the Canon Sx50 at $369 here on Amazon because I think it takes better pics without the tinkering and has more versatility with a better zoom,( has a horse shoe and it takes pics in Raw. Not that I would actually use those features).Finally, shop around if paying more is going bug you when you find out later.  Right now here on Amazon the Nikon sells for $376.P.S. I don't know if anyone has tried the Eye-Fi wireless sd cards, this might work in the Canon, which would bridge that whole wireless feature gap.SD Card Tip: if you have a SD card laying around the house, do yourself a favor and Format it before you use it. When I put my old SanDiskHC 4 GB size card into the Nikon it showed that I only could take 91 pics before formatting, then after formatting it, it went up to like 3,000 or something.

Ok, looks aside, I'm still trying to get used to some of the features of this camera.  In comparison to my comparable canon, there are some pros and some cons.  The pros: reaction.  This camera has a great reaction.  When you press the button to take your picture, it has a smooth and quick depression and you can really quickly take several pictures in a short amount of time with little effort.  I also like the transition between the viewfinder and the LCD display, it's quick and easy and converts from one to the other fast.  This camera also has a slightly better (more powerful) zoom than my other auto zoom camera and it seems so far that the stabilization is a little better, too.  Cons:  some of the features are a little confusing to go between, focusing is not quite as easy with this camera as with my Canon and while I think I have something in focus when I look at the picture, it's not.  That may simply be an adjustment that I still have to make to the camera, but out of the box it seems a littler harder to get the focus right with this one than with the other one.  This camera also goes to sleep or blanks out after a very short time of no activity; so if you have zoomed out and are waiting for, say, a fawn to get in range for a shot, be wary - the camera will blank out on you after about 20 seconds and you will have to \"wake\" it back up again.  Hopefully you didn't miss your shot in that process.

3-Inch LCD (Black),---Canon PowerShot SX50 HS 12MP Digital Camera with 2.8-Inch LCD (Black),---Nikon COOLPIX P520 18.1 MP CMOS Digital Camera with 42x Zoom Lens and Full HD 1080p Video (Black) (this camera).The video shown is with the respective camera to show the zoom quality of that camera. (The videos were compressed).  On the Pany and Nikon, when you move the zoom lever all the way to the right then you are at maximum optical zoom.  The canon is a little tricky because if not careful you will end up using the digital zoom because moving the lever all the way to the right puts you in digital zoom mode.IMAGE QUALITYNone of these cameras will look as good as a dslr.---The Pany was true to color and appeared to have built in HDR ( when taking an image where half is in the shade and the other half sunny, the Pany took two images then automatically combined them).---The Canon looked a little washed out but images still looked nice.---The Nikon takes the best images IF the subject is static, but if you have a moving object expect to get blurry images from the Nikon.ZOOM CAPABILITIESBased on 35mm equivalents, you have the following for wide angle through telephoto.....Panas (FZ70)...60X... 20mm - 1200mm....Canon (SX50)..50X... 24mm - 1200mm....Nikon (P520)....42X... 24mm - 1000mmThe viewfinder and LCD on the Pany appear not to capture the entire area, once the image is on the computer it appeared to have a wider angle of view.  The extra wide angle is really nice.SOUND QUALITYThe Panasonic appear to have the best microphone of the bunch and hence the best sound quality.", "Date": "October 14, 2013"}, {"Title": "Works great, when it works", "Author": "S.

I contacted Nokia who said 'it is working within specs.'Also - battery life is bad.  Get extra batteries.  GPS really eats them up and, by the way, the GPS receiver is not that good.  Indoors, when even my HTC One X gets a solid signal, the camera will not lock to GPS.The lens is very good and the sill picture quality is excellent.  JPG compression is pretty high (4 and 8 times).

Go check Nikon's web site. Amazon won't let reviewers post links but go to Nikon's site and search for firmware update for this P520 camera. Their page listing firmware updates DOESN'T EVEN KNOW THIS CAMERA EXISTS as of the date of this review, much less have an update available.My camera came with firmware 1.0. Well, simply, it isn't finished. Many of the advanced features described and illustrated in the user manual just AREN'T THERE. The ones that are don't work reliably. I got this especially for the GPS feature. It is slow to lock and keeps losing lock, even though it is allegedly \"always on\" once you enable it. After recording GPS coordinates for awhile you have to choose an option to \"Save\" them. Well where were they up to now if not saved? Anyway, I choose save and the camera just locks up totally. None of the buttons work. It has been an hour now and it is still locked up. Not even the automatic screen dim after a few minutes (which you can't adjust -- another feature they didn't get around to programming yet) is kicking in.I'm a software programmer and I recognize this as the symptom of half-baked software rushed to market before it is done. The camera itself seems great physically. Maybe in a year or two they'll finish the software and this will be a good camera. But not now. Many of the settings described in the owners manual are simply unusable in its current state.Finally, by looking at their other products, I can see that even if there WERE a firmware update available, they wouldn't let ME have it. You see, you have to run a Windows program that creates a firmware.bin that you put on your camera's memory card. Well that is just stupid. Just give us the firmware.bin file directly!

Undercoffer", "ReviewID": "R3K96A5R5N89ES", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "So my wife told me a few weeks back she wanted to get a more real camera. Neither of us is a photographer, we have no real interest in photography. She wanted it so she can take pictures of the kid, and the pets, and our activities in higher quality and resolution than her cell phone or our cheap point and shoot cameras could offer. More to the point, when she has them printed out professionally, she wants them to look nice -not pixely or distorted.THE SEARCH BEGINSSo costco has the nikon DSLR's. I have a photographer friend who bought one and has had good results using it and says it's a real good value. It's also $1000. That's a bit excessive for us, as we wouldn't know where to even begin with such a camera. There's also higher-end point and shoot cameras, which are probably pretty good as the MP's of them have really risen in the past few years. However, the problem is they don't zoom, or don't zoom very far. And once you use the digital zoom feature, your resolution goes downhill in a hurry and you generally lose image stabilization, so taking a non-blurry picture becomes nigh-impossible.Actually didn't know about this line of cameras at all. I typed in \"digital camera\" into amazon's search engine and started browsing. Didn't get very far, so I decided I'd look at nikon's offerings as I owned a higher end film nikon back in the day and my friend uses nikon exclusively. This camera's lower end version was on the first page of \"nikon digital camera\", and after looking at the different options I settled for this one.THE CAMERA:The device itself is impressive. It's not as big as a DSLR, most notably it doesn't have a giant honking disconnectable lens hanging off the front of it. What is present is the HUGE built in auto-zoom lens, the flip around screen, and the selector wheel. I love that the wheel is made of actual steel (or I presume steel) and the edges are coarse so it's easy to use in your fingers. Each selection has a very positive detente, so there's no question about what setting it's on and it definitely does NOT feel cheap. The flip around screen is large and has good resolution. I'm not really sure why it flips around, and if I ever find a use for that feature I'll update this review. The body is weighty, but not super heavy and feels good in your hands and overall has a real good look to it.THE ZOOM:It has a little selector on the lens body which puts it into manual mode which is a real nice feature. I've yet to use it, but if I was more of a pro photographer I could see needing it for faster action shots at a distance. The zoom on this camera is impressive. I'm so glad I purchased the higher end version with the big zoom as you can really take distance pictures easily.THE VIDEO:It really amazes me that I can own a device for a reasonable sum of money which takes this good of video and pictures at the same time. The video is great, there's no other way to put it. I don't feel like I've settled for a combo device which does nothing well. This camera seems to do it all well. The audio isn't the best-best, but it's infinitely better than a cell phone video which is all we require from it.THE FEATURES:Read the manual, it has them in spades. Honestly, I've yet to use even half of them. But for taking quality pictures and videos, and a great zoom feature this camera seems to do no wrong. Also, it's worth mentioning that you can't use filters with this camera as it's presently configured. However the lens is somewhat threaded and they sell adapters that allow you to use filters. Honestly, I don't have any expertise in that department so I don't know if I'll ever do that.SUMMARY:This camera is more than enough for your average picture taker. My friend toyed around with it for a bit, and his thoughts were that if I ever get bored with this camera a proper DSLR will be the next step, but for my uses it's so far beyond adequate it's unlikely. I'm very pleased with this purchase and so far have not had any issues with it's usage.", "Date": "January 27, 2014"}, {"Title": "Great Camera", "Author": "Ray Parks", "ReviewID": "RM8AHOPNQCX74", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "very light and takes above average pix with a great optical zoomI own several more expensive Nikons and this one is a great surprise as to the picture quality and simple to use.", "Date": "January 20, 2014"}, {"Title": "Great camera", "Author": "Carl R.

After I pretty much drove my Kodak EasyShare M893 into the ground over three years of use (June 2008-July 2011) and 10,000+ pictures, I got the Nikon Coolpix S9100 in September 2011. Although I still use the S9100 as my general-use camera having taken more than 4,500 pictures since purchasing it, the P520 has now become the third camera I've owned since 2008. It's a well-built, high quality camera with a lot of good features that will produce some stunning pictures under the correct conditions. I have yet to test it to its full extent since at the time of writing this review it's really cold here in southern Minnesota, and I don't dare expose this thing to temperatures of -15!Some positives about the P520:* Indoor pictures turn out great, but you need to know when to use the flash, and when you can compensate using exposure compensation. As an example, I took a really good shot of my family over the Christmas holiday, and although it was slightly overexposed, the lighting conditions inside the residence where the picture was shot was actually relatively dark. Flash and the AF assist light on the front of the camera were important for allowing the shot to come out correctly. During the day, if you're planning to shoot indoors, use the Best Shot Selector (BSS) continuous shooting capability to get the most crisp shots you can.* The number of different image resolutions is excellent for being able to take shots with many different aspect ratios (4:3, 16:9, 3:2, 1:1, etc). Overall, the camera's image resolutions tend to favor 4:3 ratios (for standard-resolution monitors), but I still have two options for taking pictures that will fit my 16:9 widescreen monitor at home perfectly (1920x1080 @ 2MP or 4864x2736 @ 13MP).* Really like to have the power to experiment with aperture priority, shutter priority, and program modes. For an amateur photographer like myself who likes to snap a lot of pictures on campouts with the Boy Scout troop I'm in, this is really a good way to see what settings work best when conditions change frequently.* The way that you can hold the camera just like a regular DSLR is awesome! It's just one way to add to the experience of owning this piece of machinery.* Having the LCD screen tilt and rotate is nice when you need to get the camera into an awkward position or other location where taking a picture would otherwise be inconvenient. You can definitely take some good selfies with this camera! I haven't used the viewfinder enough to know if it's of any practical use since the regular LCD screen is of such high quality (921K dots), but I can say that it's hard to look through it since it really forces me to squint out of one eye pretty tightly. It's uncomfortable at times.Some negatives about the P520:* Would like to see some improvements to the menu system. I think that the reactivity to selecting menu options is nice with the command dial, but using the multi selector dial to select options seems to be a little slower compared to how my S9100 would be able to just breeze through them all.* Yes, the auto focus issue is certainly something worth mentioning here, but that's just something I've learned to deal with even on my S9100. I'm used to it being slow sometimes.* The Nikon-branded case that comes with this camera (if you purchase this as a \"kit\" instead of just the boxed package) is indeed too small. You won't be able to fit the camera in there unless you cram it. The strap just ends up making an already tight fit worse. As mentioned in the \"Photographer's Guide to the Nikon Coolpix P520\" book (which I also highly recommend purchasing), you can get the Lowepro Rezo 100 AW camera bag, and this will come with a rain shield which can be draped over the inside of the bag to provide better protection from the elements when necessary.Other thoughts:* Some reviews state that you absolutely have to take the lens cap off before powering on the camera to prevent the lens zoom motors from grinding and generating an error. This is not true -- if you turn on the camera accidentally without remembering to take off the lens cap, it does nothing to hurt the camera in any way since the lens cap would be attached to the lens and not the body. But you will see a very black-colored display if you do end up forgetting to take it off!* Be sure to buy an external EN-EL5 battery charger and spare batteries for this camera. As you normally have to leave the battery in the camera to charge it, I don't know if I would trust leaving a camera as expensive as this unattended (for me at summer camp, this is a high possibility, so the purchase of an external charger was an absolute must).Considering all of these points, my final verdict has to be that this camera has very good potential for becoming the best camera I've owned yet, but I have to test it further to try out all of its built-in features.

Back in the mid-2000's when the Digital Rebel was kicking up it's heels it seems Nikon had no clue on how to compete in the lower end of the digital market.  Today things are different.  I had a few Panansonic FZ cameras but abandoned them when the UI was getting long in the tooth and Panasonic was distracted.  I've since moved onto M 4/3 cameras and am generally happy.  Except when I need some lens reach.So I'm shopping around again.  I think Nikon is really trying in this compact segment of the market.  The P510 had alot going for it.  (The P510 was the breakthrough camera.  The P520 is more treading water and has some issues that make the P520 a misstep (battery life, focus hunting for most of the long range, etc.)  So my experience is one of shopping for a travel zoom and I've been doing a lot of research and putting hands on these cameras before purchase.  The IQ of the P510/P520 is really good for the compact segment.  The body design overall is nice.  The menu system is adequate.  However, personally, I really like the experience of a viewfinder.  A viewfinder really can put you into the scene and really concentrate on composition.  It is quite important.The problem is that the viewfinder on the P510/P520 is tiny.  I could not believe how small it was.  I felt like I was looking through the window of a very small fairy house.  It is not a usable viewfinder.  In fact it's almost like not having a viewfinder at all.  Note to camera makers:  *** 201,000 dot EVF is a joke *** .I don't know if Canon and Nikon and the rest realized this.  But the market is ripe for a small camera with a good sized viewfinder for $300 price point.  The Canon SX500/510 is a terrific sized small camera.  If you put a solid EVF on that kind of platform sales would go through the roof.  Stop playing the megapixel wars (this is happening now with settling back to 12-16 MP), stop the hyper zoom wars (50x is just silly), settle on quality, not just specs, and put a blessed viewfinder that is really good (1,440,000-dot) on a small body of decent zoom (max 24x to 30x) and watch a stellar hit in the making.I've decided to get a Fujifilm FinePix HS50EXR 16MP Digital Camera with 3-Inch LCD (Black) to quench my long lens urges.", "Date": "February 24, 2014"}, {"Title": "TOP POINT AND SHOOT CAMERA", "Author": "George M.

Sadly, this camera is exactly the same. Very disappointing. Even if you get lucky and the auto focus locks in where you want, many of the images are soft. Color is decent. Video however looks great. But I returned the P520 immediately. If you're looking for crisp images, you might be surprised at these recommendations which I feel found that elusive sweet spot in the mega-pixel/image processor dance: The Sony H50 (the Carl Zeiss lens unfettered by excessive noise is something to behold) and the Canon SX40 (which is what I just bought and am loving it).

Second, the manual focus feature in video does not work and can not be applied, i. e., the bad auto focus can not be turned off.  Third, while recording video the camera went badly out of focus on 3 different occasions and never could find focus.  I had to turn the camera off and then reboot it before it could again find focus.  I have been a pro for 29 years, I know of what I speak.Follow up to initial post: I have been in discussion with Nikon and the final word from them is that the camera will always go out of focus momentarily when in video record mode and the zoom is adjusted.AMEND:  See my post dated June 6, 2013.

Estimate to repair substantial part of purchasing a newer, updated version with many of the same basic features my wife liked, plus some updates like the wireless transfer of pics to smart phones, etc.  Will try the new P520 out during a visit to Disney World soon.", "Date": "August 31, 2013"}, {"Title": "Botched Order and duplicate charges not good", "Author": "William Cottringer. Ph.D.", "ReviewID": "R3TOPHIOMZCP48", "Overall": "1.0", "Content": "Why in the world would I want to buy something else from an order that was dreadfully botched up. on 12/29/30 I ordered this Nikon CoolPix P520 and compact bag. On 12/30/13 my credit card contained charges for 2 cameras (ordered 1), 2 bags (ordered1)and a 16 gig memory card (did not order) for a total of $784.16 when the total was $383.50. Now I have to return the oneextra camera that I got yesterday 12/30/13 at my inconvenience, and then when I get the second package, this evening or January 2, 2014, with the other camera bag and memory card, which I didn't order, I will have to againre-box the items and return them, after trying to find the right label for the right order to print and attach and then deliver to UPS. On top of that I have to monitor my credit card to make sure thr correctrefund is made or protest the wrong posting ifthat is not done. All very time consuming with no real live person to talk to and understand my frustration.I have been a loyal Amazon customer despite your order botching and trickery in getting Washingto State residents to pay sales tas, regardless of where the merchandise is actually shipped from, taking your price right out of competiveness in my just buying these things from the store, without any such frustration or delays that I am experiencing, and then ending up paying more money for and gas money and time trying to straighten out.I guess you are too big to be concerned about one single very unhappy customer, but please do note thatI do have a very large following on my writing sites as well as some inside communication ability with some of the executives there.I would be greatly appreciative if you could do something about this problem. Thank you for trying to save a good customer. Bill Cottringer", "Date": "December 31, 2013"}, {"Title": "Poor ergonomics", "Author": "R.
