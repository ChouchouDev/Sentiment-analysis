{"Reviews": [{"Title": "17,500 miles traveled", "Author": "A.S.", "ReviewID": "R2ITZXZGDWXLLW", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "This is a great camera for fun outside activities. It was used in salt water, pool water, waterfalls, and the beach. You can take it everywhere with you during a vacation or outing without worrying about it breaking.  I had it in my damp swimsuit pocket for hours and it worked great every time I took it out to snap off a picture.  It worked well covered in sand, tanning lotion and dry salt Crystals.It was odd to rinse the camera off in the sink to clean it.  I suggest this is done and the camera left to dry before you open any of the compartments.  Also be sure to clean the rubber seals well when you re close the doors. The battery life is enough to keep you shooting pictures for the day.The camera is heavy, but it is designed to be rugged.  The indoor and low light picture quality is grainy.  The Auto setting has trouble triggering the flash.In all this camera is perfect for an out door camera. It will go on all your adventures and serve you well.", "Date": "June 15, 2013"}, {"Title": "Nice photos, but video makes hammering sound", "Author": "Hummingbirds", "ReviewID": "R2C52A7O70B5MQ", "Overall": "3.0", "Content": "We purchased two of these (in different colors) -- one from Amazon, another one from Walmart. The wallyworld one already went back. They both have the same problem. The video (while very high quality) has an issue with the audio. There is a constant annoying hammering noise in the background of every video, especially when panning. It doesn't seem as loud when keeping the camera still, but move it a little and you will hear the clicking of the little guy with the jackhammer who apparently lives inside. We've tried playing with the settings, changing everything possible, and problem still remains. So it has nothing to do with settings, the battery, or even the SD card. This is definitely a defect in the Olympus TG-830 cameras. It is such a shame too, because the photos are very good, and the video (aside from the audio) is very good as well. I also loved the fact that it is a waterproof camera that is built to be rugged. I just wish the video was better on it. Maybe they will fix this in the next version. If you plan on only taking photos, you would be happy with this camera. But I would not recommend this camera to anyone who wants to capture their priceless memories onto video (at least not if you want audio to go with it!).UPDATE: 8/14/13 - After returning the defective ones to Amazon and Walmart, we ended up purchasing one from our local professional camera shop. I had the chance to actually test drive it before buying. And lo and behold, no hammering noise in the video!!! So we finally got a good one. I guess it just depends on where you buy it and which lot they received. After using this camera on vacation, we love it!!! It takes great photos, underwater and above. The video is also very good (both underwater and above). Just make sure underwater you are using one of the underwater settings as it will come out with much better colors underwater. I would really recommend this camera, but ONLY if you can test drive the one you are buying first to make sure it does not have the audio defect.", "Date": "July 13, 2013"}, {"Title": "An impressive, tough camera", "Author": "Steve B \"Mac User\"", "ReviewID": "RSMU2GI2Z3IJR", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "When I bought this I was mostly looking for an alternative to the Hero, mainly because I didn't want 180\u00b0 fish-eye, and wanted something with more versatility than just dedicated use, attached to my helmet. When I received it and started looking into the operation of the camera, trying things out as I went, I was quite pleasantly surprised with the features, quality, speed, and versatility.It DOESN'T come with an SD card, which is probably good since I always replace the cheap cards with something of size and speed that works for me. I bought a SanDisk Extreme 32 GB for it, and it works great! The camera uses internal memory for burst mode, then transfers to the SD card, transparent to the user. It records 1080 HD at 60 frames/ second in normal mode, but if using the 120 FPS mode to create slowmo, it rolls back to 720P HD.There are built-in modes that provide color and other corrections for underwater shots, snow (very bright) conditions, and many others, including night pix. The optical image stabilization works very well for me since I have a twitchy hands. I look forward to my vacation to try out the camera as a helmet cam. It weights in just under 8 ounces.If you want a dedicated camera designed for sports activities, then the Hero 3 Black would probably be better (especially for diving!), but at $400, the Hero is a significant investment. This camera will do 90% of the job at 70% of the cost, with the added benefits that come with a small Olympus.Picture quality is outstanding and movies are awesome.This is a preliminary review. After my vacation where I plan to use it as a helmet cam while mountain biking and river rafting in Moab, UT, I'll update this with any issues I've uncovered. If there are none, then this review will stand, with a 5 star rating.", "Date": "June 6, 2013"}, {"Title": "Not only rugged but packed with awesome features.", "Author": "Kyle \"cylem\"", "ReviewID": "R1LKD5EYZ2GXCY", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "I had thought about looking around at a rugged camera after going on a canoe trip. I was looking around at the Fuji Film and the Nikon models and they seemed pretty good. I had loved the look of the Olympus TG-2 but it is a bit pricey. I also liked that the TG-2 had a f/2.0 aperture which is miles ahead of pretty much any other rugged camera.I looked at what else Olympus had and the TG 830 looked pretty good, and was priced well too. I ended up choosing it over the TG-2 and the other cameras because it has the best zoom (5x optical, 10x SR zoom), It has the most video feature including 720p 120fps, 60I 1080p, and some other fun shooting modes. It if I saw correctly can take the fastest burst shots, as well as the functioning, shot to shot etc speed seemed to be as fast or faster than the others.So now that I have it i'm very satisfied. The controls are very easy to use (MUCH easier than my previous canon 520hs).Controlling the settings on the camera is very straight forward and I havn't really had to question anything at all.. The Camera feels a bit awkward in the hand, it seems a bit large but I think it is just me getting used to it.Video modes I really love, firstly the 720p 120fps is awesome and fun to use. However one drawback is  the picture darkens down in 120/240fps mode and with the low aperture it makes it hard to get a good video without some decent light (This is mostly true for every high speed video camera though). There is also the ability to take photos in the video, and a mode that automatically takes photos at a set interval during shooting.It has the magic art filters which some are honestly kind of fun I have to admit. There is also something I like alot, a handheld night mode which optimizes everything for shooting a picture during very low light without a tripod, It's nice to have it right on the mode wheel for easy access.The zoom is fairly good with the SR enabled, (though you must have it at 16mp for tha to work). As well you can zoom during video recording as well.I haven't tested the waterproof of it yet but I'm sure I will in due time. I reccomend this to anyone who wants a rugged or an extremely fast camera as well!", "Date": "July 21, 2013"}, {"Title": "Best camera EVER, hands down. Let me tell you why...", "Author": "Emma Johnson \"ExploreLiveLove\"", "ReviewID": "R3QYKQPRBFHL8F", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I must say this line of cameras are the best I've ever owned, hands down. I had the first model that came out to go to Costa Rica with. Survived being dropped, stepped on, sat on, cold weather, hot weather, pools, and oceans. After 4 years, I had dropped the camera while one of the little doors was open and it bent the door. It still worked, so I took it scuba diving in Bali and after about an hour in the water the camera died. I took it to the surface only to find it flushed with water - gutted. I dried it out in rice for several days, and although it would turn on again it was never the same. Bought the new model and haven't looked back. I've used it all over the world and in several pools/oceans/rivers and has still provided like my old model :).One more story that will build your confidence on this product:I had bought my brother one for his birthday. He studies fish and is an outdoorsman to the max, so he's in and around rivers and rocky terrain all the time. One day he had dropped his camera in the river, and because it was a deep and quick moving river, they couldn't find it. Two years later, they were diving the same river and actually found the camera. The camera still worked!!! It took great photos, all seals were still in tact and working great, and the only \"problem\" with the camera was that the blue color had worn off in some areas. I could not believe that thing survived for 2 YEARS!

Then I tested out the video in 1080p and it looked great!.... only one problem (that I've noticed thus far), I got the annoying hammering/clicking noise in my playback of the test video. From what I understand, It's due to the AutoFocus of the camera during recording (you can hold the camera to your ear and hear it clicking even when not recording) and the audio picks up the clicking from the AF. This issue has apparently plagued this model and others in the Olympus family. Now here's the kicker! Some have had this issue and some have not (their cameras work flawlessly). So I called Olympus support and some foreign dude told me that they have never heard of such issue (yeah right!) and told me to send it in for repair. So pretty much, I'm going to exchange this camera for another one and pray that it doesn't have the same problem. I'll update as soon as I get a replacement and see if that fixes it.UPDATE 09/21/2013Received my replacement camera yesterday and tested it out, unfortunately, the hammering noise still remains in the video playback. It seems in the replacement camera that it's not as bad though. I'm going on vacation in 10 days to the Bahamas, so I'll see how well it really performs and rate it accordingly.

My first one is a SW1030 and is still working fine but is about 8 years old. I bought this one to take over the duties of photo taking on our trips. I did not hesitate buying Olympus given the experiences with my first one. It survived countless trips snorkeling, swimming haning on the beach and in tropical humidity. A few drops and being sat on countless times.I have the TG-830 for just over two weeks and have been experimenting with the various functions in varying conditions. As with my other Olympus I am very impressed with the capabilities of these point and shoot cameras. But like all small point and shoots has some limitations. I will try to lay out my findings in short points for ease of reading.1. Picture quality is superb just as many professional photo website reviews have noted as well. (not sure what the reviewers on here that say it takes crappy photos have been doing but it is not the camera.) I have displayed the pictures on my 55 inch tv and do not see any graininess or pixilation.2. low light photos are good, and the hdr mode makes the pictures very well balanced, but works best on non moving subjects. they are far superior to the ones i got from my other camera.3. The flash is limited to nearby objects which is expected but works great, used it in restaurants for food photos and subject photos it does not over expose the center of the photo and does a nice job of highlighting the object of focus.4. Video works well have only played with it a few times, HD is smooth with no noise as noted by some reviewers. When changing zoom or when the distance to an object changes there is some minor noise created by the mechanisms but if there are other noises going on they tend to over power this.  Slow mo was good but quality suffers slightly and is limited to only a few minutes of video at a time.5. Battery Life..... saw several posts of poor battery life. NOT true. I have been using the camera for 2 weeks on the initial charge. I have taken about 100 photos and 5 videos as well as reviewed and shown pics etc to people numerous times. I did however use an external charger (my original camera came with one and just happens to use the identical battery.) Yeh for me now I have 3 batteries.6. Camera functions are easy to use and access, although slightly different from my current one so I get a bit confused still on the buttons but if this is your first one they are easy to use and intuitive.7. Start up is quick and multi shots are acceptable, burst mode has not been tried yet.8. the 5x zoom is good and quality does not suffer,9. GPS seems to work well and finds its location quickly, i have not tried the landmark function. I generally have left the gps off.Overall I am extremely pleased with this camera. Photos are clear and sharp, has great functions, I would and have recommended it to many people.

I thought maybe the battery was defective so I purchased another battery with a wall charger. Still would not power on. I called Olympus and they said it was covered under warranty. I sent everything in, including my receipt which proved when it was purchased. I called a few times to get an update on the repairs as it was a few weeks after I mailed it in. I was told the contacts where the battery were dirty and just needed to be cleaned and it would be mailed back to me within three days, they also verbally confirmed that my warranty covered everything. Three days came and went and my camera had not been shipped. I called again and was told that I had to pay as they didn't have any warranty information on file for my camera. I was in the process of moving across the country at the time and had my copy of the receipt packed away. I was able to retrieve my credit card statement through Best Buy which listed my purchased and I emailed them the copy. I was told that the camera would be there the Wednesday before I moved. It was not, so I called Wednesday and had them change the address to my new address. They had my Camera for around 8 weeks or so. I was not happy to say the least. I just received the camera back and the first time I used it, it worked fine. I just tried to power it on to take Easter Pictures of my children and the power button would light up, but everything on the camera is dead. It does nothing. I took the battery out and held the power button down for a while, thinking it may fix the problem, but when I put the batter back in, the power light instantly comes on and it stays on without powering the camera. Also, tried using the other battery I had as well, still did not function.  I am pretty sure that it is bricked. So, I have missed taking Christmas Pictures of my children and now Easter, and had to document their Holidays with my Ipads camera instead. I am not happy at all, and will be calling customer service on Monday....again. This problem has been ongoing since Christmas, and my money has been wasted.

I did not go snorkeling for a few days so most of the first pictures I took were above water and the pictures were very good especially the sunset special setting.  Panorama pictures were hard to take and turned  out with strange blue artificial color.  However I only tried it a few times so I am not sure if I can blame that on the camera or my inexperience.  I practiced underwater before going snorkeling and had a lot of troubles getting good pictures underwater.  Make sure you read about the use of the different types of flashes and underwater special settings when using underwater.  Macro seemed to be the best.  When I figured out the flashes most of the pictures were amazing underwater.  One tip, if the water you are in is not that clear with sand granules or other types of things that the flash may reflect against do not use it.  In those cases I found that if there was good light it was better to not use the flash or use the the LED flash.  I am still learning how best to take the best underwater pictures but overall I took some great pictures when I did it right.  I am giving it only four stars because there are certain things like the pet photo options that make no sense as well as the fact that the manual was not that great about teaching me the best way to take underwater pictures.  Besides that if you want a camera that can take very good pictures above and below water once you figure out the camera then I definitely recommend this camera.  The best setting I found was the sunset setting on SCN mode.  I have gotten some of the best sunset pictures ever with this camera and I have a few other cameras including DSLR cameras.  It is also great because you do not have to worry about protecting it when you go from underwater to the beach to freezing temperatures.  One final thing, lots of people have mentioned a ticking sound with the movies.  I found that I did get a ticking sound when I did movies in lower light.  However, in good light the ticking sound was not present.  That is another reason why I give this camera four stars, but I care more about pictures so this is not that big a deal for me.  For the price this a dependable above water and underwater camera.  I write this review giving it four stars but I expect as I learn everything that it can do with this camera that  I fully expect that I will later give it 5 stars.  One last thing, some reviews mentioned poor battery life.  I took about 200 pictures underwater as well as videos in one day and still had battery life for sunset pictures in one day so I would say that the battery life is quite good.  If you make sure to charge the battery every night before taking pictures the next day for average people I think it is just fine.  In terms of complaints about the in camera charging, I did not find it a problem day to day.  I highly recommend this camera for anyone who wants a good to great camera for the average photographer above and below water.", "Date": "March 27, 2014"}, {"Title": "Excellent camera for all purpose!", "Author": "A.

We thought maybe it was just something about the screen, but sure enough when we uploaded the pictures to our computer they were slightly blurry.  It does seem that the photos taken in the absolute best lighting (outdoors, in good sunshine) were better, but in slightly less-than-ideal lighting (indoors, or cloudy skies) there was a blurry quality to all of the pictures.I know what you might be thinking, that it was some kind of \"user error\" like we weren't holding the camera still enough, but we are pretty avid photographers and have never had this problem with other cameras before.

I have a compact ultra zoom camera that I'm happy with, but with an upcoming trip to Mexico including snorkeling, we wanted to go waterproof.  The idea of something pocket size was appealing too.After much comparison shopping we ended up with the TG-830 and we couldn't be more pleased.  I'm not going to give a whole lot of technical critique.  Suffice it to say that this camera does all that we wanted it to do and much, much more.This was my first underwater photography apart from I'd done with a disposable film camera-- with disposable results!The pictures I took on the reef were really great, with natural looking color.  Hint for this and any underwater camera:  check the lens for adhered bubbles.  They are hard to see as your snapping pictures, but they'll show up when you view the results.Land based photography was terrific too.  I'm a nature fan and love taking close-ups.  This camera has a super macro mode which lets you get a couple of centimeters from the subject, making for some dramatic photos.  There's a quick and easy panorama mode which gave me great results at the Mayan ruins at Tulum.There are a lot of built in shooting modes such as fireworks, portrait etc.  I did most shooting on full automatic and was perfectly happy.  I wish the optical zoom was longer but realize that this would require a moving lens extending outside the camera body which would be impractical/impossible in a waterproof camera.  Can't overcome physics.  I did use the digital zoom which didn't give perfectly clear photos, as expected.  Still, for my purposes it's not bad.That's all that comes to mind at the moment.

I was leery of buying any underwater camera because all of the available models have at least one review that claims that it leaks water, and that the companies do not support the product.  I chose this one because of the number of features, including waterproof, shockproof, GPS, panorama mode, and HD video for the price of $199. The camera worked very well for the intended purposes.  We used it in the pool, in the ocean, dropped it in the sand, and onto the tile floor, all without any damage at all.  The camera did NOT leak any water despite taking over 700 pictures while wet.  We followed the directions to clean it after using it in the ocean, and then towel dried and air dried prior to opening the door to charge the battery.Our other Not-Water-Proof Camera is the Cannon PowerShot S110 (point and shoot model - not an SLR).  When comparing the two cameras, the Cannon definitely takes sharper pictures in all light conditions, but especially low light.  The Olympus can have some minor graininess when viewed at full resolution on our 24-inch Apple monitor, but it is very subtle.  I think the pictures of my daughter jumping into the pool looked great,  had good color and captured the memories that I was after.  I'm not sure that I would want this as my only camera, but I don't think it is intended for that purpose.  It really is made to use in the cold, in the water, and when you might drop it - all times when you would never bring your other camera.Overall, I am really happy that I bought this.  The pictures are great, the price is very reasonable for all of the features, and it captured great memories from the trip.

We have had it a few months and just recently got back from a trip to Mexico where this was our main camera.  It takes wonderful out-of-water photos.  In clear water (pool), the photos are clear and pretty good.  In ocean water, the photos come out well with a bit of editing.One thing to note is that you absolutely have to soak it in fresh water after using it.  We typically soaked it for about 20 minutes, then would allow it to completely air-dry before opening any compartments.  The battery held on for almost a week of use every day so we only had to charge it once.  I would also recommend a memory card of at least 4 GB which allows you to take about 900 photos.Overall, I am very pleased with the performance of this camera and would recommend it to others, in fact, many people on our trip asked what type it was and were more impressed with its functions than their own cameras.", "Date": "October 1, 2013"}, {"Title": "Great camera", "Author": "Zachary Gold", "ReviewID": "RYHD4YS2D78MJ", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "Great camera.

There are actually 4 underwater scenes that can be set (up close, wide, action, and standard) as well as scenes for landscapes, portraits, sunsets, fireworks, and my favorites a cat and dog setting for detecting animals' faces. I laughed out loud when I saw those settings - lots of animal lovers in the world I guess, though I suspect these settings don't do much more than the portrait setting.

Sort of like seeing a mosaic up close.  This effect is not subtle, and renders the images much worse than, say, a point and shoot from 1999.  The panorama mode is even worse.  Fuzzy.The video is a complete waste of time.  You are far better off just using an iPhone or other phone cam video.  Here's why:  The video is fuzzy, and the audio picks up some sort of in-camera adjustment, which sounds a little like far-away automatic weapons fire.  Maybe 600 rounds per minute or so.  The volume is very close to a person speaking n the video, for example.  The burst lasts for about 1 or 2 seconds each time, and it pretty much ruins the video if you want to hear sound for.The camera would be ok for a child or clumsy person who drops it a lot.If you buy this from Amazon, be sure to give it a good check during the return period.

I did some research before purchasing, and this Stylus was recommended.In \"auto\" mode I feel the pictures can get a bit grainy or the edges of things gets that weird, hard-outline effect instead of a gradual transition. However, I found these happen because the camera is setting the ISO and aperture and other things for what it thinks is best for the setting. Thus it ends up compromising quality for simplicity.In order to get the best you can out of this camera, you will have to do a little reading to understand how to set various aspects of it yourself to best fit the environment, in my opinion. The lower the ISO, the less the grainy-ness and the better the sharpness. So on auto perhaps not the best out there, but I've owned many point-and-shoot cameras, and none of them have had what I'd call \"great\" performance on auto from a more refined point of view. This is perhaps as good as it gets.As for the durability: My son took this camera with him to Africa this summer, and he captured very adequate pictures for the most part--on \"auto.\" We were pleased with its performance and durability; all the bumpy roads it endured and hard dirt it was dropped on didn't phase it in the least.

Also, when there is bright sun in the background it tends to wash out the sky. Not sure if there is a way to fix this. I am guessing it has something to do with the chrome bezel and the lens not being very recessed.I'm hoping I can find a solution otherwise I will be reselling this and looking for a different camera.Other than that issue it's been really good. Underwater pics turn out well and the camera feels extremely rugged. A bit bulky, but that's expected from a rugged camera.Any suggestions?", "Date": "June 4, 2013"}, {"Title": "Bad Photos and no waterproof.", "Author": "Boris", "ReviewID": "RR85JB70ZVE3Y", "Overall": "1.0", "Content": "The photos are not good because the lens are too small.You need much light for a good photo.No good definition in the photo.

And after that, the lens fogs, and you cant keep taking photos.Bad bad.The panoramic function are a s*** in this camera.The LCD screen are too dark. When you take a picture outside, with sun, you can't see the image in the LCD screen.In general, is not a good camera.The unique great feature are the GPS feature.
