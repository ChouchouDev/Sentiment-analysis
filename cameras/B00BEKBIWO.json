{"Reviews": [{"Title": "4/5 Stars for Overall Quality of Package", "Author": "Marcus Knipp", "ReviewID": "R2PSLQEWFR1FDE", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "All of the items are brand new and in the box.  The only complain  have is the camera bag and the tripod.  The tripod is junk and dangerous to use with any DSLR camera.  The bag is small and not enough space for what is needed.  All of the extras except the telephoto lens and the camera are all off brand items, but work just fine.  I recommend this setup as you get all you need.  Just buy a good tripod and a good camera bag for your nice new shiny camera.  Good luck", "Date": "May 11, 2013"}, {"Title": "best deal ever", "Author": "trencha davis", "ReviewID": "R2GB5UFXR8YYAO", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "This was the best deal ever.
