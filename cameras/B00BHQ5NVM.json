As I wrote in my initial review, I am coming back with more after using the camera.  Since it took me so long to set up, I hadn't any experience when I wrote about the set up difficulties.  I've used the camera in a variety of situations and am disappointed in its picture quality.  While the photos look sharp on the camera's screen, they were not sharp on my computer screens (I didn't print any). The image stabilization did not work very well and pictures taken in low (not terribly low) light were just not acceptable.  Also, there appeared to be quite a bit of \"flare\" when there was a light source in or near the frame.Now, I understand how subjective an assessment of photo quality can be so I was very hesitant to write about it.  But, when I went to shop for another camera, I was helped by an extremely knowledgeable salesperson.  This person agreed with me that the user interface was good (after getting past the difficult set up) and the WiFi features were good as well.  But we both knew that the picture quality was not as good as that of other brands.  I was glad to see that I wasn't punishing this camera because it was frustrating to set up.I have several Samsung products (HDTV, Android phone, BluRay DVD player) and I am usually a fan.  However, they don't seem to be among the best when it comes to this WB30F.  Even on the products that I do like, the user interfaces have not been worked out to a level that I would call excellent.Below, is my initial review:---It's hard to rate this camera because it is so hard to set up.  I'm giving it 3* in this review because that seems like a compromise.I bought this camera because it has WiFi and I want to have my pictures sent to my computer without connecting a cable.The camera comes with a rudimentary setup guide in the box but no manual.  After an hour or so (yes!) of searching, I finally found and downloaded a manual.  Samsung doesn't have a consistent naming policy (sometimes it is WB30F, other times it is WB 30F).  The manual appears to be complete, but it doesn't give much help with getting the WiFi auto backup to work.To use the wireless backup to a computer, you need to install two programs:  Samsung iLaunch and Samsung PC AutoBackup.  Installation of these programs begins when you plug the camera into a USB port on your computer.  But, who knew that's the way to install these programs.  If you turn on WiFi on the camera the onscreen display tells you to run these programs.  BUT DO NOT DO WHAT I DID.  I searched the Internet for these programs, found sites that purport to download the software, but instead load a bunch of hard-to-remove garbage on your computer.Samsung really needs to make it clear how to install these necessary programs.I removed the garbage from my browsers, deleted them using add/remove programs and was ready for the installation again.After I plugged the WB30F into the USB, I did get a chance to install the software.  But the onscreen display says to install \"iLauncher\" and the computer popup asks you if you want to install \"iLinker\".  Who knew?Well, when iLinker pops up, that's the one to install.  After that is installed, it gives you the option to install \"PC AutoBackup\".  The rest of the setup was okay.I haven't had a chance to look at photo quality and other features yet because I wasted so much time on installing the WiFi stuff.  I'll come back with more.", "Date": "May 31, 2013"}, {"Title": "Great Camera!", "Author": "Amazon Customer", "ReviewID": "R33NHF50A0OMAX", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "Love this camera!

I took a photography class back in college when everything was film and manual. Toggling between Menus to get the right ISO and lighting conditions, picture settings, etc. can be a pain but that's the price for digital technology.I'm still getting used to the camera as I haven't had a lot of time to go through the 150 page Manual (which did NOT come with the camera but was easy to download as a PDF off of samsung's website- Highly Recommended to do).Test #1 Hiking in Dense Forest of Big Basin. - A lot of adjustments had to be made in dimly lit places, especially to the flash and ISO. The AUTO settings did not do well but once I increased the ISO and remove the auto flash, pictures came out nice and crisp. The ZOOM is VERY nice. I took pictures of local birds and hawks from far away and they came out very nice.Test #2 The meadow of wild flowers in my backyard. They came out blurry and I'm still wondering why. I focus (or wait for the auto-focus), the viewscreen looks sharp and clear, so then *snap*- \"Hey?!?! Why is there blurriness?\". It could have been too many targets for the auto-focus to track, I was shaking the camera (but even on a tripod?) and the ISO/Flash features needed to be better adjusted. Pictures were OK.Test#3 - People (Fire Dept. Event)! The pictures came out fine and very little to no adjustment was needed.So- If what you want a camera to take pictures to jog your memory of the people and the places you have seen, you cannot beat the price. It is sad that my cellphone seems to take better pictures up close, but the phone is not a camera and can only do so much. This camera's zoom is perfect for my travel needs, has a longer battery life, more features, and of course, depending on the memory you purchase, more storage for a big trip. If I want to get into Photography as and art form, I will upgrade to a DSLR (and maybe take a class).", "Date": "December 2, 2013"}, {"Title": "Up loading the video to computer for editing", "Author": "Tarlock", "ReviewID": "R2BES5LLBHNC99", "Overall": "2.0", "Content": "The technical specifications for Samsung WB30F list the video connectivity in NTSC and AV but this model camera will not do that, the video is loaded to the computer only in MP4,  that will require newest video editing program to copy it to edit it.I did not like this in this camera.", "Date": "November 15, 2013"}, {"Title": "Troubles with Wifi connectivity", "Author": "R. Langham", "ReviewID": "R8K12LGT4LVWT", "Overall": "2.0", "Content": "Very nice camera, but I purchased it because of the Wifi options, which rarely worked.  My career is with computers, networks, software, etc., but I just couldn't get this to connect reliably to my wifi network.  I have 10 other devices that connect fine.  I was able to get it to connect twice out of about 20 attempts.  When it did, I was able to easily sync all the pictures to my Windows 7 computer, which is one of my primary goals.  5 minutes later, it would not connect again, would keep on getting \"Connection Failed\" error.I did find out that I do have to turn off my firewall completely, which prefer do not have to do everytime that I want to upload pictures.  I contacted their support, searched the manual and web for the ports.  Support was unable to help me.  Through some network programs I believe I tracked it down to a couple of UDP ports, but then was never able to test again since I could not get it to connect to my network, very frustrating.It did connect pretty easily to my Samsung Android phone and my Samsung Galaxy Tab 2.  This was not using the wifi, bluetooth I suppose.  I was able to transfer over a picture or two, but only one at a time.  It does have a nice feature with an Android app where I can actually view what my camera sees on my phone, adjust some options, and then signal it to take the picture.  Nice for group shots where everyone wants to be in the picture.I was also hoping that the SkyDrive option would behave like my DropBox on my phone.  When I get home, all my pictures on my phone are automatically synced to DropBox and then automatically synced to my computer.  Very nice.  Well, the SkyDrive transfer option was with you selecting a picture at a time.  You could not easily have it just upload all pictures (or latest pictures).UPDATE 1/5/2014: I ended up returning this camera because I could not get the wifi to work and connect to my computer.  I ended up buying a Canon wifi camera.  I basically had similar problems and then found the (modified) instructions below in a review.  Maybe this will help another person who has this camera.  Not sure if this would have resolved my issues or not.1) Click the Start button in Windows 7 then type \"stream\" in the search box, then select the \"media streaming options\" selection,2) Select the \"Turn on Media Streaming\" button then either Block or Allow the client you choose and close the window,3) VERY IMPORTANT - Click the Start button in Windows 7 and search for \"Device\" then select the \"Devices and Printers\" option - LEAVE THE WINDOW OPEN,4) (Do the camera wifi connection steps for your computer, don't recall what they are when I had it)5) On the Device and Printers window click the Add Device otpion at the top-left6) Wait for the camera to appear as a selection then click and add it", "Date": "December 28, 2013"}, {"Title": "A Very Good Camera", "Author": "Richard E Warren Sr", "ReviewID": "REECNWGWXPL4H", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "Takes great pictures.

We traveled all throughout Europe for over 3 weeks and she took some great photos. Sent our friend photos every night via Wi-Fi. Just love the camera she was using I bought one too from my return trip home. My camera died shortly with NO USE at all even after I charged the camera for approx. 3-4 hours. Then I thought I should charge it again. I did. The flash wouldn't work. Then the camera died again. I tried to hook it up to the computer but the camera wouldn't turn on again at first then again it turn on. Unplugged it from the computer and it died again. My guess is the battery isn't charging from inside the camera. The only way to charge the battery is to hook up a USB cable to camera using a plug at the end. in other words there is NOT a separate charger. You use the camera to charge the battery. I cant say that is the problem with the camera. It just kept dying. I didn't want to fuss with it anymore nor do I think I should for a Brand New camera less than 12 hours old. Sending it back. Maybe a bad batch but I wanted to keep it but now I am Leary about the camera performance completely now. I own more cameras then I would like to disclose and NEVER had this problem.

The problem is the memory card recommended does not fit this camera. It needed a Micro Memory card and this one was a full sized card that does not fit in the camera. I had to order the correct memory card in order to use the camera at a extra expense of time and money. It has to have the memory card in it as two pictures will fill the memory in the camera.
