Has an lcd color screen to see what your pointed at before you film and for reviewing what you've filmed. One word of caution though. DO NOT USE ANY SD CARD OTHER THAN A CLASS 4 OR 5. If you use any higher class sd card the camera will malfunction when it is hooked up to the computer when attempting to review or transfer.Emerson technical support has already told me that these cameras are a fairly new product and that there is a glich with any sd card higher than class 5. I went through 2 cameras (returned them to the store) before I contacted Emerson and they explained the problem. handles up to 32 gig BUT it has to be a class 4 or 5 only.", "Date": "December 7, 2012"}, {"Title": "Cheap but great waterproof dive cam!

Package arrived yesterday and I immediately tested it by walking slowly outside holding it in my hand.  First off, the video is extremely shaky due to the lens, which does not capture a wide view at all which accentuates shaking and vibration.  For those familiar with 35mm cameras this lens is a 50mm equivalent, or about half as wide as a standard wide-angle lens on most cameras.  Doesn't even come close to a gopro.  Secondly, the video is distorted, and becomes stretched near the edges of the frame - so as subjects move around the frame they look like they are in a funny-house mirror.  This is probably due to a very cheap plastic lens.  After looking at these videos on my PC, and even trying to correct the shake and distortion with my pro video editing software, I declared this a failed experiment and boxed it up for return.  Not sure yet whether I am going to spring for a gopro (probably) or just use the video on my hand-held camera for now.I'll give this two stars because I could see how it might work for relatively still applications such as shooting or just as a kid's toy camera.  But for any real action like biking - even road biking for which I intended to use it - I think you will be very disappointed.I've uploaded the test video so you can see what I mean about the shaking and distortion.  I promise I was holding the camera as still as possible!", "Date": "August 24, 2013"}, {"Title": "i like it", "Author": "pete barry", "ReviewID": "R2THOGJ6DQGNJ1", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "the camera is very light. lighter then a gopro hero 3 . has its own screen unlike the gopro .the helmet mount is for a bicycle helmet not a motorcycle helmet ( i had to order a suction cup mount )the video is great . has HD widescreen mode that is very clear .waterproof case works great . the 1st thing i did was submerge it into a 55 gallon drum full of water and it was perfectly dry and you could see very nice underwater .only cons i can think of is that there is a small black cap on the mount that secures the tightening nut ,that just falls out (i super glued it in place ) and the mount doesn't have a up down movement just left -right makes it a little tricky to get the picture centered on a helmet cus you have to move the whole mount on the helmet i am very satisfied it worked better than i thought .(dont forget to adjust the settings to HD or the picture isnt so great )", "Date": "July 24, 2013"}, {"Title": "Really great alternative to gopro camera", "Author": "Ms. Jean L.

It has passable performance in limited light, meaning that it will produce a decent low resolution image or video in typical nighttime lighting. In daylight it is better, but is still not close to HD quality. Color tends to brighten and wash out and with zero image stabilization tends to be jerky. Panning has to be done very slowly to prevent blurring. These things mean that attached to bike handlebars or a helmet will produce video that's difficult to watch. The camera is vibration sensitive, producing almost constant \"jello effect.\"  It's chief value is its low price, and so putting it in the hands of a seven or eight year old or hanging it from the collar of a pet isn't as risky as it might be with a more expensive unit like a Swann, a Contour, or a GoPro. I would suggest that those who want to record their adventures skydiving, snow boarding, biking or other sports spend the extra money for a higher quality unit.It is easy to operate and has easy to use controls that are not at all complex. Choosing photo, video or playback is achieved by a three position slide switch on the side of the unit. The power and shutter switches are on top. It has an LCD screen that allows the operator to see and frame shots when hand held. You will need to purchase a microSD card of at least 2 gigabytes to use the camera. It will recognize larger volume cards --I used a 32GB card and it worked just fine. The camera is NOT waterproof in any way and should be kept away from water in spite of the GoPro-like \"waterproof\" case.It does not charge quickly. The initial charging took four hours and recharging it after a half hour of video took almost two hours. Transferring files from the camera to computer is pretty slow as well: it took six and a half minutes to copy a 900MB video file to my laptop, a feat that takes two minutes with my GoPro or Contour Roam.All in all the Emerson camera has features that make it useful, but its low video quality limits the camera's value considerably.

Pan a room with different kinds of lights and you can watch the white balance clicking through it's filters to find the right one.  Doesn't handle lowlight at all.It does have a built in mic, but you can only use it if the camera is not in it's housing.

I was very disappointed with what I found... I was greeted with very cheap wiring and components. When I tried to carefully put it back together, the switch to change modes somehow snapped off. So I exchanged it for another one the next day. I got another SD card to go with it and tested it before I left the lot and it texted good. When I got home, I got to play around with it.Now for the facts that matter to most buyers. This camera doesn't have a focus at all, so if what you're taking a picture of or recording is out of the preset focus zone, you're capturing blur. The screen isn't very clear, but it gives you an idea of what you're pointing at. It sucks in the dark, you can't adjust brightness or contrast and the zoom seems to be pointless because it just blurs more, but on the bright side you can zoom while recording. I haven't had a chance to test the sound quality yet.Just to put this into better prospective, this reminds my of cameras from 1999ish. My HTC Evo 4g (first Evo) has a better camera... after tax, I paid $43.99 and I kinda feel like I got ripped off. A good price for this camera would be about 29.98 after tax seeing as it comes with good mounting hardware and a waterproof case. Then again, you have to buy your own SD card if you buy it from big lots, so $15.99 after tax would be a fair price in my honest opinion. I'm going to be mounting this to my dirtbike when I get home, I'll also test the sound then and upload videos to YouTube. I've already made comparison videos of it vs my phone, I just can't upload them yet because they are 720p and I only have 3g right now, so it'd take forever and the upload would keep getting interrupted.On the bright side its easy to use, you don't really need the instructions it comes with. They come in 2 colors, the plastic isn't cheap and I'm over 1000miles from home, so I'm trying to break it before I head home, so I can take it back if needed. So far its solid as long as its in the case. If go pro has a camera that this can compare to, I don't see how they can charge as much as they do...that said, I'm sure they compare them just to make more sales. This camera seems nearly weightless out of the case and in the case, it feels like its less than half a pound... if they made this same product and added auto focus, brightness, contrast, sharpness and sold it with an SD card, it'd be worth what I paid and I'd feel like I got a good deal.", "Date": "January 10, 2013"}, {"Title": "40 bucks at big lots", "Author": "Love to Read", "ReviewID": "R20Y2O26BQN227", "Overall": "3.0", "Content": "the equipment that this camera comes with is okay.

You can point to it and hopefully bluff someone into confessing what they did to you in the event of a crash.I got this for Christmas after complaining about not being able to work with GoPro's mount.  The GoPro requires you to screw on and screw off your camera each time you lock your bike up.  I've since lost the screw, and paying for the grab bag of mounts for a single screw seems...  screwed up.The mount is small, but for my bike's mounting location, it worked well enough.  Don't expect to get it to fit close to the stem of your bike, so your photos/videos will be offset some.There is something deeply wrong with the camera.  Half the time I can turn the thing on, but not be able to turn it off.  The cheap plastic buttons on the main body of the camera lodge under the main body's housing, and no amount of reasonable pressure will get them unstuck.When the camera locks up when on, there's only one way to turn it off... Remove the memory card (which is an additional $35-50USD for a Class 10 32 Gb Micro SD card).  Whatever you were filming will not be saved.Customer Service?  What's that?  Took me forever to find a phone number for Emmerson's Customer Service, and then they told me that it was a licensed product or something... the lady gave me a phone number for another company which I called, waited forever (10+ minutes of being told my call was very important), then finally opted to leave my phone number for a call back.  (Message assured me it would be in one business day)  It's been over a month now, and I haven't heard from them.The only reason I still have the camera?  Someone Tossed the packaging and BIG LOTS! won't accept it back w/o the original packaging.This thing sucksTheir Customer Service SucksSave your money up and buy a real camera.", "Date": "January 30, 2013"}, {"Title": "camera", "Author": "Peter J.
