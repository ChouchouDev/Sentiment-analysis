{"Reviews": [{"Title": "NikonCOOLPIX P520", "Author": "Joel Williams", "ReviewID": "R13LXV5PDYOKS3", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "This is an amazing little camera.  I bought it for three reasons: First , since I got interested in photography I make it a point to almost always  have a camera with me.  It's handy for that because it's not practical to take my D800 to the grocers for example. Second, the zoom is the equivalent of a 1000 mm lens.  I just can't drop $17,000 on a lens at will and also I would not want to lug something that heavy and bulky around unless i knew i was going to need it. So you can reach out and grab a shot when you need to and the Bokeh is great.  Third, you're not as much of a target as when you're sporting a nice camera with a big expensive piece of glass on it.  If you want to point and shoot you can and it has scene modes.  It also has P, S, A and M modes if you want to manipulate settings, It has great resolution at 18.1 MP and takes full HD video.  You need a tripod to for long zooms.  I highly recommend the P520.", "Date": "August 29, 2013"}], "ProductInfo": {"Price": "$366.95", "Features": null, "Name": "Nikon COOLPIX P520 18.1 MP Digital Camera with 42x Zoom (Black) Super Bundle W/ 16 GB Secure Digital High-Capacity (SDHC) Mem.
