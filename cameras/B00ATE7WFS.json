I can't even tell the difference in speed compared to my DSLR (5 yrs old)Lumix is known for superior lens quality - I read an article that they have a very close working relationship with Leica which speaks for itself. So I wasn't surprised at the image quality - even at max zoom. BTW keep in mind this is a 24 mm to 480 mm lens - meaning that 24 mm is a nice wide angle - comes in handy for indoor and nice group shots.The reason I sound so exciting is the video capability of this camera. We went to a school concert the other night and I took some incredible videos of our little girl on stage. Just make sure you switch the recoding mode to MP4 - the default setting is on AVCHD the compression mode that no computer can read!The videos I took were great - not too noisy even though it was real dark.I am very pleased and feel this is a great little camera that is compact but gives you lots of shooting options.", "Date": "May 10, 2013"}, {"Title": "Excellent Features and Good Picture Quality", "Author": "CT Guy", "ReviewID": "RZEVC0UY9E447", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "I was deciding between the ZS25 and the Canon SX280HS.  I felt that the Canon had better picture quality but the battery life issue during video was a deal breaker.  I decided to go with the ZS25 and I am impressed with it so far.Pros- Compact size. Perfect for traveling especially with the ability to charge the battery in the camera.- Leica lens- Very good picture quality with natural looking colors- 20x optical zoom is impressive. Ability to zoom to 40x with intelligent resolution and maintain very good picture quality.  See the pictures I posted.- Intelligent Auto does a great job picking the best settings for the situation.- Pictures taken with HDR have significantly better exposure- Very good pictures in low light situations- Panorama feature- Very good HD video capability- Many creative picture features- Decent battery life (200+ shots with good mix of pictures, video, and flash).  You should get a spare battery if you plan to be shooting for a full day.- Made in JapanCons- Pictures can appear soft. Intelligent Resolution makes the pictures noticeably sharper.- Pictures viewed at 100% can appear noisy.  This should not be an issue if printing to typical smaller photo sizes.- Panorama feature is nice but picture quality is not as good as regular pictures- Videos with zoom fully extended and be a little shakyI gave the ZS25 four stars because the picture quality does not seem to be as good as my old Panasonic DMC-LZ2.  The DMC-LZ2 takes excellent pictures for a 5MP point and shoot.Overall, the ZS25 is a very good camera with many useful features.  The Intelligent Auto feature makes it easy for anyone to take very good pictures with no effort, which is what many people look for in a point and shoot camera.", "Date": "September 23, 2013"}, {"Title": "Best pocket camera on the market.", "Author": "A.

Previously I have owned Sony, Nikon and Canon pocket digital cameras and ended up giving them away. Lumix is by far the best. I wanted to upgrade to this DMC-ZS25 for more MP and the extended Zoom. This is an excellent camera for trips and vacations. It is small, light, compact and fits in your pocket. If you do not want to carry bulky DSLR's and still get lots of functions this is a good choice.The only issue I have is Panasonic did away with the external battery charger. Now the battery has to be in the camera to charge. A USB cable and an external plug is provided. I do not like this system. Should something go wrong you will never be able to charge the battery. This has happened to the SONY DSC P1 a camera I purchased in 2001 for $799.00.Panasonic DE-A65B battery charger adapter will work with this battery, DMW-BCG10PP. Since the spare batteries are sold on Amazon by third party vendors with many negative reviews I decided to purchase the spare battery and charger from Adorama.Another minor issue I have is the microphone is mono and not stereo. This was not a deal breaker because the camera is great and Amazon had it at a reasonable price with quick shipping.If you plan on keeping the camera for a while I would strongly recommend purchasing the battery charger adapter while they are still being made.

Gast", "ReviewID": "R8BJVEK1W4SZE", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "This little camera does it all very well. I am in my late sixties and I have been a photo buff most of my life. I am so happy to now have my ZS25 for my travel camera. It is very lightweight, simple, sturdy, and it takes great pictures.The 24-480 mm lens is amazingly clear and undistorted throughout the range and the image stabilization lets you use that 480 in situations where you normally wouldn't even try.I shoot mostly with the smart ISO setting. However, having a preset \"scene\" at the ready is very nice and it is simple and quick to change. I normally have mine set to \"through glass\" for candid shots through windows. As if that were not enough this little camera also has full manual settings plus Aperture Priority, Shutter Priority, and exposure compensation. So if your creative juices start flowing you have all the tools available.The HD setting is one I thought I would not use much. However, after a few experiments I now just leave it on. Its biggest benefit is in backlit shots. It averages out a nice exposure almost every time. The HD effect is not the unrealistic overdone effect that you see in the photos making the rounds on the web. It simply brings out some highlights that have been missed in the given lighting conditions. That makes this camera truly a point-and-shoot. All you have to do is pay attention to your composition.I don't know what more you could ask of a point-and-shoot camera. Panasonic has created the ultimate in this model. I once read a wise statement somewhere to the effect that \"the worst camera in the world is the one you left home because you didn't want to bother carrying it around with you.\" You need never be in that situation again.

The smaller, pocket-size versions all work well and last about 2-3 years before they go bad.  By that time the technology changes anyway, so it's not a big deal for me to think about replacing them with the latest version.They have always been well-made, and delivered excellent quality pictures.  Expected the same for this one.Tried it for over a week, but was just not loving it.  The build quality of the Lumix DMC-XS25 was not as good as it should be.  They seemed to have replaced some parts with more plastic than in past models, and the quality of the pictures was not perfect either.  Disappointing, as I have loved all my other Panasonic cameras and recommended them to others.  I still like the smaller versions they offer, but this one did not deliver.It felt like it was going to break, and the photos at 16 MP didn't seem as crisp and sharp as you'd think they should be.Instead, ended up paying less than $100 more for the Sony DSC-HX20V, which seemed like more of an investment but looking back I cannot imagine NOT doing it.  The Sony is head and shoulders above this Panasonic.  The only downside in comparison is that it's not as fast as the Panasonic (i.e., when you are trying to take pictures in rapid succession the Panasonic is much faster, as the Sony evaluates each photo as it's taken and corrects it electronically).I still like Panasonic, but for this specific camera it's just not up-to-par.", "Date": "April 29, 2013"}, {"Title": "Great upgrade for a Lumix camera fan", "Author": "med_bookworm", "ReviewID": "R1UW1BT1DI170U", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I am a previous owner of the Panasonic Lumix DMC-FS5 (and before that the -FX07).  I used these compact point-and-shoot cameras with great glee for the last 5-6 years until the -FS5 put a gray spot in every blue sky two week before I was to leave for vacation in Iceland.  I looked extensively at the other Lumix cameras (I wanted the Leica lens & the features I was used to from the -FS5) and decided to upgrade to the -ZS25 for:- Wide angle lens:  This is awesome for group photos and scenery (and hand-held self-photos). I had this on my older cameras and it is great in this camera too.- Macro mode: I love taking up-close flower pictures.  Unfortunately, this doesn't work as well as on the -FS5 and -FX07 cameras. On the old cameras, I could always force the camera to focus on the flower I wanted; this doesn't always work now with the flower mode in the intelligent auto.  However, when it did focus, the pictures were equally marvelous (or better) than before.- Panoramic mode:  This definitely took the most practice so it doesn't look choppy or have lines; however, once I got the hang of it, this is an amazing function. [see sample in customer photos]- Hand-held night shot:  This function is amazing.  I used it in the Vasa museum in Stockholm (17th c. sailing ship in dim light) and the pictures look in even better light than what it looked like in real life. [see sample in customer  photos]- HDR: This function solves classic problem of trying to get the scenery and sky to look awesome in same photo.  The camera decides when to use this in the intelligent auto mode (so you can't force the camera to do it) but it figured it out most of the time and took amazing shots. [see sample in customer photos]- 20X optical zoom:  I didn't even have the digital zoom turned on and was able to take really great zoomed in pictures without a tripod.  The stabilization works really well.The other note is that I rarely used the intelligent auto mode on my old Lumix cameras because I preferred to choose the mode.  The technology has improved so much in the last 5 years that now the intelligent auto is so much smarter, it did a better job of choosing the mode than I did so I used it most of the time (unless taking a panorama).  I really debated whether to spend the extra $100 (over the cheapest point and shoot Lumix models) and was very glad I did on vacation.I also got an extra battery (Panasonic DMW-BCG10PP ID Secured Battery) and external battery charger (Panasonic DE-A65BB Battery Charger for DMW-BCG-10) from B&H; Photo which allowed me to take more than 250 photos per day and to charge both batteries at night.  This camera does not come with an external charger.  Instead you have to use the (very short) cable to plug the camera in, which is annoying if there is no table at the level of the plug in.", "Date": "September 30, 2013"}, {"Title": "Photos are a little soft", "Author": "Yarii", "ReviewID": "R3PAIMAV1AYRSO", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "I like this camera although the photos are a little too soft.....still, my favorite Panasonic is the SZ7 which is cheaper, but also more basic in features. Panasonic Lumix SZ7 14.1 MP High Sensitivity MOS Digital Camera with 10x Optical Zoom (Black)  At the time of this review, the SZ7 is over $100 cheaper in price but it does not have P/A/S/M and only 10X optical zoom. They both start-up fast, faster than any other cameras I own/have previously owned, fast focusing (unless you are zooming out at the max), fast shutter response, fast recycling to take the next photo due to the CMOS sensor. (I always use Class 10 SDHC cards). If only the SZ7 had full manual controls, it would be THE perfect camera as the photos are much sharper to my liking.PROS:-- The ZS25 is a fast camera for focusing, shutter response, etc.-- Colors are good, natural. Not abnormally bright or vivid unless you have it set on vivid.-- Leica lens - LOVE Leica!-- You can optically zoom during the video and the zoom motor is quiet.-- Metal body (aluminum?) - although it sounds like plastic when I tap on it, it has good build quality.-- CMOS sensor.-- Creative Controls: Like these, some never available in previous Panasonic cameras-- Made in Japan!CONS:-- Too soft, I can sharpen them up only so much in photo editing. It seems like several Panasonic cameras I've tried in the past year or so have been too soft for my liking. I guess most people like softness or Panasonic would change it. Hmmm...-- No separate battery charger, the battery charges inside the camera. This is starting to become the \"new normal\" with most camera manufacturers, except for the LX7. Quit being so cheap Panasonic, supply us with a separate battery charger!-- No RAW, for the RAW enthusiasts (I am not).The 1080 video is decent, but not as good as Sony cameras provide. Battery life - pretty much average. I got 200 photos and a couple videos before the low battery indicator was down to 1/3 left.I've always loved the Quick Menu feature on most Panasonic cameras. What I don't like on this camera is they eliminated the playback switch, now it's a button. On older Panasonic cameras, I kept the Playback Switch on playback when I put the camera in the case, as that prevented accidental zoom of the lens if the camera accidentally was turned on inside the case. You can't do that with this camera.I struggled with the star rating on this camera, 4 stars is all I think this camera deserves (since Amazon's definition of 4 stars means \"I like it\", and 3 stars means \"it's OK\". Panasonic should have done better. This camera replaced the ZS15. When new cameras come out, you are always hoping they are better than what they are replacing. If you're happy with your ZS15 (or ZS20) there's no reason to upgrade to the ZS25; I wouldn't even call it an upgrade, it's more like a downgrade.

I use these cameras several days a week, but not for anything where crystal clarity is required in the photos, so the fact that ALL the photos are just a bit fuzzy was never that big of a deal.  What bothers me is that the LCD screen on the FIRST DMC-ZS25S I bought went bad after 2-3 months.

Alan Mart\u00edn", "ReviewID": "R1LI8RH64YKT2S", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "First of all I want to address a few of the negative reviews I've read about this camera.I'm not sure I'd give a camera a bad rating for the failure of a battery. If a camera is requires frequent charging, that's one thing. But a battery failure after several months--?  My opinion-- I've  had the camera several weeks and I've no problems with excessive battery usage. I did purchase the Wasabi battery package--2 spare batteries.The other problem noted was the brightness of the screen in bright sunlight. Read the instructions on the monitor settings to make sure it's set to the mode that automatically adjusts the brightness for the LCD. Finally, there were comments about \"soft\" images--again check the manual to make sure you have the settings on \"fine.\"The flash--with any point and shoot or DSLR it's best to get get an LED bar and turn your flash off. The effective range of the flash in these small cameras is minimal--don't expect amazing results from the small flashes fitted in point-and-shoot cameras.The next are for cameras in general, including a comment or two for this model:In general, on reviews for almost all cameras there's the \"zoom issue.\" Well, it's cinematography 101 not to use/overuse a zoom. If you look at TV shows and movies they use fixed shots, with cut-aways. Zooming, if used at all, tends to be a tight (close-in) shot that goes wide-- you just don't see the zoom-in and zoom-out on professional production works.Please be sure you purchase a \"Class 10\" SD card with a very high write speed.The two other cameras I strongly considered prior to my purchase of the ZS25 were the ZS20 and the Canon  SX280.The ZS20 has documented problems with both zoom failure and lens/sensor dust. I guess the price was right, so there was high volume sales of that model--it does have GPS but that sucks the battery dry if it's on. So unless you need it--? The other feature is the touch screen, but I've always had problems with \"touchy\" touch screens. Personally, I don't like touch screens on my cameras, but just my preference.The Canon SX280 is great if you want to buy a camera with a video that doesn't work. Why anybody would spend that amount of money on a camera, when the video doesn't work? I don't understand it. You can tell it's a design defect, otherwise there would be plenty of \"refurbished\" units on the market. There are none--the bad units are returned to Canon and written-off as a loss.If you want a well-built camera made in Japan with manual and automatic controls, this is for you! Sharp photos with terrific colors--I'll post some photos later. I think you'll be totally happy with the ZS25!

Easy enough to get authorization online and I included a copy of my Amazon purchase receipt and sent it off by USPS Priority Mail.  That was well over a month ago and I still don't have my camera.

No email \"Expected completion date\".  Nada, zip, nothing.Originally, I had hoped to get it back within 3 weeks to take on an overseas trip.  Ah what a fool I was.  My first email to Panasonic after 10 days to 2 weeks was \"status of my camera\" please.  I at least confirmed that Panasonic had received the camera, when the return email said \"status: with repair technician\".

I kept writing every week, same response \"In repair\".

The slowest possible way - Fedex ground (OK, I know UPS ground could be slower). So sometime next week, more than a week after they shipped I should receive my camera.

These types of Lumix cameras are wonderful, we have had these type for years and they just keep working.  We started with a 7MP version (can't remember the model number) with a 10x zoom and it just worked (no HD recording back then), it was easy to use and started up quickly. The thing that drew me to this camera range was the lens, these cameras use Leica lenses, for the uninitiated Leica is a German manufacturer of high quality cameras and lenses, remember that the image has to get to the sensor via the lens, if the lens is no good the sensor gets crap and the image suffers.I got a DMC-ZS20 last year and it was equally easy to use, mode mega pixels and HD recording, this time with 20x zoom like this model.  The build quality is awesome, these cameras look like they can handle the day-to-day knocks that they will experience.The question I get a lot is why bother with a dedicated camera when you have a smartphone with lots of megapixels.  I suppose it depends on what you want to use them for, for day-to-day pictures when you don't have your camera around the smartphone works, however for more serious subjects (like weddings, birthday parties etc) then a dedicated camera (in my opinion) gives much better results.Some of the features that are cool with this camera, the 20x zoom mentioned above,  different picture taking modes including full manual, battery life, the size (they pack a lot of technology in to a small space), one touch HD video recording.Overall a good camera that performs well and produces good pictures in many situations.", "Date": "February 23, 2014"}, {"Title": "Good wide angle camera", "Author": "Barbara Almli", "ReviewID": "R1FRR36AYHTSOM", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "Takes good wide angle photos which is why I purchased it.

However I was a little disappointed when I upgraded to the Panasonic Lumix DMC-ZS25.It's still a great camera but a \"downgrade\" in some ways - the touch screen is gone as has the high speed video (those weren't big deals for me) but the bigger problem was artificial limitations on the optical zoom. The zoom cannot be used with panorama mode forcing the most distant view in panoramas and if you zoom on close by objects ex. trying to capture a flower without bending over the camera doesn't focus after a certain zoom level. Not sure why the designers turned off support for these creative use cases.The camera is still sturdy and slim for a 20x optical zoom. The very wide angle 24mm Leica lens and the Power OIS work well allowing full use of the 20x optical zoom.

I literally read the manual on the departing flight.  Not only is the ZS25 small and very easy to use, it is very flexible in its functionality and takes spectacular pictures.  For example, we visited many ancient churches in Italy that have amazing artwork.  In most cases, no flash is allowed, which is a good thing.  And, the churches are often quite dark inside.  But, I still got spectacular photos.  In some cases, I couldn't really see much detail with my eyes, but the camera could actually see the pieces with truly remarkable detail and clarity - and I didn't even have a tripod.I did a fair amount of comparison shopping before purchasing this camera, and I am very happy with my choice.  Although it does not have an optical viewfinder, the high resolution display does an admirable job even in bright sunlight. It easily fits in a pocket, is very comfortable to hold (which many of its small competitors are not) without inadvertently hitting any controls, has minimal shutter delay,  and is available at a very fair price.

I have been using the ZS25 now for about a month and at first my impressions were that the camera was excellent but with continued use I am incredibly dissappointed.  The additional megapixels and small sensor size on the ZS25 has unfortunately resulted in noise filled images.  There is so much noise in the images they are essentially useless if you intend to crop or zoom in.  The longer telephoto zoom is nice and can be used without a tripod with no problem.  I have borrowed my younger brothers ZS15 and without question the ZS15 takes better images than the S25. For the past two weeks I have been trying out an Olympus SH-1 and Nikon S9700 as potential replacements and both take images with less noise than the Panasonic, unfortunately they each have other issues and I can't recommend either of them either (reviews coming soon for each).
