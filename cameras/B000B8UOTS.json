Wilson \"wilson99\"", "ReviewID": "R27EW0676TYIU0", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "Sony has once again delivered another unique pocket camera. It delivers great high resolution images with good detail and saturation. When I set up the camera, in the menu system, I set the saturation and sharpness up one tick; I also set the, what appears to be a huge 3\" LCD touch-screen monitor up to brighter level. What a incredible difference going from 2\" to 3\" monitopr size. One can really share the shot captured with family and friends... With this done, the camera produces great images from the pocket. The flash seems significantly brighter than the \"T\" series cameras. I purchased a spare battery and SONY's high speed 1GB data card, which will hold over 250 images at the my recommended highest resolution setting. Also set the video to \"Hi Resolution Fine\" 640x480 mode. The videos are stunning, vivid, and compete with typical tape video camera performance, for the casual viewer. May be over-spoken, but, the video quality is so good comming from this little footprint, the results are shockingly positive.There are a number of sites including SONY's site, and [...] which describes the camera in exhaustive detail, so I will not repeat these facts here. I am an adjunct faculty member of Florida Altantic University, FAU, teaching \"Principles of Digital Photography and Post Image Processing,\" Pearson Education, 2004. To help our students with their study of this topic I attempt to keep up with the latest releases of digital camera equipment. Go to the site address a part of [...] site, to see images from this exciting new camera. FYI, I purchased this camera for my personal use and am delightd with its performance. I also have professional Canon digital SLRS, however I cannot put them in my pocket. There are trade-offs with a pocket camera, but this little masterpiece has what it takes to capture those pictures, when carrying a SLR is not convenient.

I was on the fence between the Canons (SD400, 450, 500 and 550), Nikon S1 and the Sony DSCT1.  While the SD500 and SD550 were top of the line (fantastic image quality), all of them have their shortcomings.  There is no such thing as a perfect point and shoot digital camera.  Just before I made my purchase though, I was lucky enough to come across the Sony DSC-N1 on [...]  My first digital camera was a Sony (DSCP1).  I did love it, but poor battery performance and expensive proprietary accessories led me to jump the Sony ship.  Within the following 5 years, I acquired the Canon EOS D60, the Canon S60, and the Canon S410.  So let me just say, I am a Canon guy.  I gave the S410 away as a gift and decided to get a new ultracompact.  Enter the Sony DSCN1.The camera sports the largest LCD (3 inches), which at the same time is a touchscreen.  There are hardly any physical buttons on the camera itself.  For an ultracompact, there is an unusual amount of manual control (Aperture, Shutter Speed, White Balance, ISO speed, Color Saturation, Contrast, Flash Levels, Sharpness, etc.).  The shutter speed can be set from 30 seconds to 1/1000 of a second.  Aperture ranges from f2.8 to f16.  You can even compose your picture, and then touch the screen to select which object you want to be in focus.Like many other ultracompacts, there is no viewfinder on the N1.  All your shots are composed on the LCD.  Some think this is a \"con\", but I honestly don't know why one would really need the viewfinder.  Perhaps the bright LCD may be problematic in a dark theater where you are bootlegging the latest Sony Pictures release...  Picture quality is excellent.  Focusing is very quick and COMPLETELY silent.  Macro performance was impressive. The camera itself powers on quickly so it's honestly only about 2 seconds before you get your first shot.The camera comes with 26MB of onboard storage for pictures and supports the Memory Stick Duo storage cards (Why so proprietary Senor Sony?).  It is an ultracompact, but it is on the larger side of the ultracompacts.  It will drop into your shirt pocket but there will be a noticeable bulge...  It's about the size (slightly thicker) of a deck of cards.  The N1 sports 3x optical zoom, but an oddly diminutive 2x digital zoom.  You would think it would be harder to incorporate optical zoom than digital but whatever.  That should not keep you from this camera.  You can easily zoom in and crop after you put your photo on your computer.  8.1 megapixels affords you great license in that arena.  There is only one thing that seems pretty inconvenient.  It takes hours to charge the tiny little battery.  It took me about 4 hours to finish my initial charge and the manual suggests that you leave it in an additional hour after the light goes off to get it to maximum charge.This is clearly an awesome camera.  I saw a rating of 6.6 on Cnet.com and am still scratching my head over that one.  Meanwhile their readers rated it 8.5 on average.  Like I said, there is no such thing as a perfect point and shoot digital camera, but the Sony DSC-N1 packs quite a punch.  I'm going to date this review by saying I paid $450 for mine (I'm going to be pissed in a year's time when it's going for a hundred dollars less).  It retails for $499.  While the price can be considered high, the value is definitely just as high.  I highly recommend this amazing little gadget.Pros:8.1 MegapixelsAwesome Touchscreen ControlsGood Battery Life (well over 200 shots)Photo Album/Slideshow ReviewManual Focus TargetingISO - 64, 100, 200, 400, 800Carl Zeiss Vario-Tessar LensGood flash rangeCons:- It takes 4-5 hours to charge the battery- Bulky Ultracompact- LCD gets fingerprints- Pricy (mine was $450)- 2x Digital Zoom", "Date": "January 11, 2006"}, {"Title": "not for beginners ?", "Author": "David C.

You can guess the way I decided to go.SIZE: Overall, my expectation when I bought this was that thecamera wuld be somewhat smaller in thickness, but it is prettythick compared to other cybershots.  It still fits in yourpocket and still is the talk of the town when you show it topeople.  But it's the size of a deck of cards when most newercameras are the are half the width.  Not a big deal, really, butjust settling your expectation and You will hear this over andover again.DESKTOP SOFTWARE:  I have yet to truly play with the desktopsoftware, but it appears that most of the desktop software isgeared to the video aspect of the camera.  I did like thetransfer software that came with my Elph, but this camerainteraction with the host computer seems limited to creating anadditional drive that you must grab your photos from and kindalame video software.DESIGN BUGS: One thing Sony has to fix.. and I'm not sure ifthis is common with all their cameras or cameras in general.When the battery dies and you're in the middle of a shot, thecamera does not retract the lense back into the case with afinal gasp of power.  The battery died on me during X-mas, and Iwas stuck with an extended Carl-Zeiss lens for the rest of theweek.  This is kinda a problem if you don't carry the chargerwith you on extended trips.INTERNAL SOFTWARE COMPLAINT:  The camera stores its photos intwo separate areas when you take a photo.  The Actual higher resphotos go in sequenced folders (named 1xxMSDCF [xx being ansequential number for each new file]).  Smaller low resduplicates go in \"albums\".  You can slideshow \"albums\" by dateand the high-res originals by folder.  Most likely, you willdelete the high res when you transfer to your computer.  My onlythree complaints are if you rename the high-res folder outsideof the above naming convention(i.e. \"X-mas_Day_2005\"), thecamera fails to recognize the folder even exists anymore untilyou name it back to the accepted naming convention. Also, if youdelete the high-res image, it doesn't give you the option todelete the low-res album images as well in the same step.  Youhave to do this manually yourself as additional steps.  Finalfeature complaint is once you take the photo, the software doesnot allow you to control how long the preview stays on the LCDscreen.  It's either ON or OFF. That's it.(I think the paint feature is rather stupid.. but heck it's agimmick I don't have to use).PHOTO CAPTURE:  This thing gives you the functionality andflexibility of a more professional camera all wrapped up in theeasy to use touch screen. I had to play around with it a bit toget my shots more in the range I liked, but \"Auto\" is the bestmethod by far when you don't have the time... but this featurescan still generate the occasional blurry image if the camera isnot steady enough...  The other Photo capture complaint is indark rooms where I've seen other cameras create an enhanced sortof lighting upon the picture subject within the LCD beforetaking the photo. Here, you have to settle for a weak red lighton your subject to guess if your subject is in the photo in adark room.(Also, 8.1 MP is rather over the top for a camera.  I readjustedmy camera back to the space saving 5 MP)Overall, even if someone can't point out solutions to my abovecritique, this camera is worth every penny.  I just have tomention things you won't hear folks mention since they're soenamored with the product. I have yet to use the videofeature...but I do hope Sony provides better software for thephoto aspect of the camera, I do recommend downloading Google'sPicasa software to manage your photos on your desktop.Other than that this camera is innovative.  I had 5 peoplesay \"I gotta get me one of those\" in the last 2 weeks.  I'm alsowaiting for my cradle accessory via Amazon to come in the mailto use as a desk photo display.  So may be able to extend myreview a bit when that arrives.", "Date": "January 3, 2006"}, {"Title": "Very Worth the Money", "Author": "EK \"EK\"", "ReviewID": "R43W8130F0L3J", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "To make a long story short, This camera rocks my socks.  I am beyond impressed by its usability, durability, looks, and excellent picture quality.  The touch screen feature is going to usher in a new wave of copycats, because it is so much easier to use than having a million buttons all over the camera.  The camera contains very advanced noise reduction technology and the detail clarity and color quality of the pictures will blow you away.  I actually do find myself using the album feature quite a lot because I already downloaded 4 of my favorite songs onto the camera for playback.  The paint feature isn't quite as useful after the novelty wears off, but it's still fine to have.  The battery lasts through 250+ shots and with at least a 1GB Sony Memory Stick Pro Duo from Amazon(they have a pretty good price actually) you'll have an amazing camera to enjoy for years to come.", "Date": "December 2, 2005"}, {"Title": "Makes me want to switch back to Sony", "Author": "Gadgester \"No Time, No Money\"", "ReviewID": "R3NP9LNT4DIHDB", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I haven't owned a Sony digital camera in years.  Not that Sony cameras are not good; it's just that I always ended up getting a Canon, a Casio, a Fujifilm, a Minolta, a Kodak, or a Pentax.  At the moment I use my Nikon D70 for photos that I want to keep or submit for contests, and my Fujifilm F10 for everyday snapshots.  But recently I had a chance to play with a Sony DSC-N1 and I was really impressed.  I think I'll buy a Sony next time, now that I've accumulated quite a number of Memory Stick PRO Duo cards (for my Sony PSP and Sony camcorders).OK, everyboby knows the N1 has 8.1MP resolution, and the price point is sweet for an ultra-slim, stylish digital camera.  The 3x optical zoom is a bit disappointing; I really wish Sony had done something outside the box and gone beyond 3x zoom.  (Panasonic has a compact camera that sports a whopping 10x optical zoom coupled with optical image stabilization!)  3x is adequate for most situations, though, so maybe it's no big deal for most casual shooters.But more than the 8.1MP resolution, which makes great enlarged prints, the N1 has excellent image quality.  I always say that image quality is much more than resolution; it's more about color reproduction (is red really red and is blue really blue?) and white balance (is white really white?) as well as technical factors like saturation and contrast.  Older Sony digital cameras tended to give crisp but dreadful looking pictures.  Not the N1.  Both indoor and outdoor pictures look terrific, and as long as you have adequate lighting (or use the flash), you'll get pictures that you'll be proud to share with friends.  Digital noise does kick in quite a bit at ISO 400, meaning that in dim light situations you'll notice digital specks when you enlarge the picture.  But for 4x6\", or even 5x7\", prints as well as viewing on a PC monitor or HDTV monitor, the N1's image quality comes across as quite satisfactory.  What really impressed me was the flash quality, which seemed better than most other compact digital cameras (except Canon ones).So if you want a digital camera with excellent image quality, the N1 should be on your shopping list.  Overall I still slightly prefer Canon's image quality, but not by much, just by a little bit.  It's probably because my idea of \"perfect\" image quality matches the calibration parameters chosen by Canon's engineers.  However, I know many other people who prefer Sony's crispier looks or Fuji's \"scenic, natural\" looks, so you may want to compare the N1 with a Canon or something else to see which camera produces the results you personally like the most.  Bottomline: the N1's image quality ranks very high among compact digital cameras.Of course, the N1 has many other things going for it, too, like the enormous 3\" LCD in the back.  The LCD just looks huge because 1) it is, and 2) it takes up most of the real estate of the camera's back.  Its resolution is a little over 230k, twice that of most other digital camera's LCDs.  This gives a sharp-looking image on the LCD.  Ourdoor visibility is good as the LCD is bright.  Like Sony's camcorders, this LCD is touch-sensitive, which means you can control camera functions on the LCD itself.  I myself am neutral on this.  Some people don't like Sony's menu-driven interface and would have preferred a few more buttons.  For most casual photographers, this is probably not going to be a big deal.The N1 is beautiful looking, and it has good shooting performance.  I'm talking shutter lag here.  It's quite fast.  Not as fast as a digital SLR like my Nikon D70 or a Canon Digital Rebel XT, but the N1 felt slightly faster than my Fuji F10.  This is a camera that performs, period.Battery life is decent; I think the official rating is 300 according to the Japanese CIPA standard.  My Fuji F10 is rated at 450 and I swear I've taken close to 1,000 photos (about 40% with flash) and I still have 50% left.  I don't know if the N1's battery has the same stamina as my F10.  But even at 300 shots per charge, that's pretty good.I want to make two recommendations to any perspective N1 owner:1) Be sure to get a spare battery.  Even though the N1's battery life is good, the battery might fail (e.g., in extreme temperatures) or you might forget to recharge it before a new day starts.  Always carry a spare if you can afford it.2) The N1 uses Memory Stick Duo, and you'll most likely buy the \"PRO\" version.  (The \"PRO\" designation simply means the Memory Stick Duo card is over 256MB.  Sony's marketing people are nothing short of absolutely stupid and perverted.)  You don't have to buy the \"high-speed\" (red) version of Memory Stick Duo PRO; but as a fellow Amazonian recently told me, the high-speed and regular versions cost the same, so you might as well get the high-speed one.  Now comes my tip: buy two or more memory cards instead of a single gigantic-capacity one.  Say you want 2GB in total.  Get two 1GB Memory Stick PRO Duo cards instead of a single 2GB one.  Why?  It's the old adage that \"don't put all your eggs in one basket.\"  As with the battery, always carry a spare.  Trust me, if you don't have a spare battery or memory card, Murphy's Law will get you, sooner than you think, too.In summary, the N1 is a terrific ultra-slim camera.  It takes great pictures, is stylish, has a huge touch-sensitive LCD, has good battery life, is reasonably easy to use, and did I mention it takes great pictures?  It's good enough for this camera aficionado that my next compact camera will probably be a Sony.", "Date": "April 29, 2006"}, {"Title": "WOW WOW WOW!!

Unlike some other cameras that limit videos to one minute clips, the Sony N1 allows you to record as long as you have capacity.- crisp and vibrant photos- battery lasts a fairly long time.

Actual length will vary depending on usage.- built in album/memory- can take photos in burst mode- has many pre-set modes to choose fromCons:- When recording in video mode, the N1 cannot zoom.  You can only zoom before you begin recording.- Didn't come with any cheap camera sleeve- Didn't come with even a small memory stick (perhaps I've been spoiled by other camera manufacturers that give at least a 16MB or 32MB card).- When shutting off the camera, the lens cover sometimes does not  close completely (could just be isolated incidents).- might have been nice to also have the old manual viewfinder when you want to save your batteries- Taking videos drains the battery pretty quickly- No image stabilization feature (knew that it didn't have this before I purchased. it would have been nice to have it though as many of the new high end compacts have the feature)- uses the Memory Stick Duo (the smaller one).  Many laptops come with built-in card readers nowadays, including compatibility with Memory Stick Pros.  However, none that I know of have a slot built in for the Memory Stick Duos; therefore, I always have to bring along the adapter, or the included USB cable.- LCD can get dirty with fingerprints- Shutter lag for higher quality shots (5MP-8MP)Recommendation:With the prices for flash media dropping, I would recommend getting at least a 1GB card memory stick.I've uploaded a chart showing the estimated capacity of various sizes of memory sticks.Overall I'm happy with this, and would recommend it to anyone who can afford to spend a bit more for a point and shoot camera.-------------------(Edit 2/27/07):  I noticed some places are still selling this camera.

It is the best camera I've had so far, and my first Sony.  I went form the Kodak DX 7440 to the Casio EX-750 to the DSC-N1.  The 3\" screen is tremendous, there is no other way to describe it.  Not only large but clear from all angles, in almost all lighting conditions, and a very fast refresh rate and GREAT resolution and color depth.

The battery life is phenomenal I took well over 200 photos and did the slide show a few dozen times and the thing still had 1/4 battery life.So here is my list of things I like.1. Touch screen which is very cool, fast big, and easy to use.2. Picture playback, fast it moves through the pictures on the camera in no time at all.  Not like the Canons that sit there, thinking, thinking, thinking oh here is the photo.3. Compact size and feel.  Very sturdy light weight and packed with features.4. Slideshow feature is so freekin cool.  Everyone that has seen it loves it.Ok here are the things I don't like.1. that big nice touch screen ya well it can scratch and there are not any pre cut screen covers for the camera.  I took a film for a PDA and cut it to size to solve the issue but It would be nice to have a pre cut one that could be bought.2. The photo cd making software that comes with the camera didn't detect my cd burner so I had to save it as an image file and image files can only be burnt to a disk using Toast for the Mac. Didn't like that feature too much.That's it everything else I love about this camera.  I would recommend this camera to anyone who is looking for a nice camera that does it all and makes it easy for those of us whom are not photographers.

I wanted this camera to replace my 2 yr old Nikon Coolpix 3100, which is a great camera.  I was really hoping for something that would take good action shots.  The DSCN1 takes great pictures but they're not any better than my 3MP Nikon.  I even made an 8x10 from each of the cameras and the Sony pics aren't any better than what I get from my Nikon.The DSCN1 is a fun camera with the slideshow, music, etc. but if you're looking for a high quality picture from your camera, the price of the Sony just isn't worth it.  There are too many other cameras out there that will give you as good of a picture as you will get with this Sony at a much less expensive price.If you decide to buy a camera I do recommend that you purchase it from Amazon based on their return policy.

Young \"analytical geek\"", "ReviewID": "RSRAXJTE9DH2H", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "First, and foremost, this is the best digital camera I have ever owned. It is very important to always have the camera mode set to \"Program\". After reading reviews for weeks, prior to buying the camera (Used for 3 days), two complaints stand out. The video noise, while using the playback, and the lack of a viewfinder.  The noise is eliminated in the video recording mode by setting the \"Focus\" menu to infinity or either a lower setting (7.0m, 3.0m, etc.). I may add, the results are always better when you do not use the zoom while video recording. Since this is a 3X optical zoom, moving closer to the subject is better. When you watch professional movies, you will see less zooming because most cameras create a sound, which can be annoying. It is a must to use the pro duo memory stick, using the 640(Fine) setting. Second, the viewfinder is not an issue, when you 1.)Turn on the AF Illuminator, 2.) Set the camera mode to \"Program\", 3.) Increase the EV to \"+2\", 4.) Set the Flash Level(see the menu under the infinity setting) to \"+\", and set the Focus to either \"Center AF\" or \"Spot AF\". These seem like a number of steps, but believe me, it will come second-nature, when you practice, practice, practice. This camera is an unique individual. You paid for it, so, use it and it will prove it's worth. I have no complaints, that this camera's built in features cannot be remedy.

My first digital was a Kyocera 5MP S5. I was looking for a camera the focused faster and had good low light capabilities.The DSC-N1 has a very fast autofocus and this makes getting moving objects easy. In fact it makes getting all shots a lot easier.  The autofocus is the best I have used. The low light assist lamp makes getting night shots easy and works well inside or near the subject.  The DSC-N1 focuses quickly in low light.The screen is really is easy to see in bright sun and fairly good in low light.  I was sceptical about not having a viewfinder but the screen works great. The touch screen works impressively. It was easy to figure out the menu system and the touch screen works great with just a finger.  I believe that a lot cameras will be going to the touch screen in the future.  The touch screen makes changing settings quick and easy.  The best part is that the DSC-N1 works perfectly in the auto setting.The movie mode is easy to use and good quality.  The ability to take long movies really makes this feature much more usable.  I am impressed with the stability of the the photos during the movie mode.  The movies play back smoothly on the 3 inch screen.The flash is really impressive for a point and shoot camera. It will easily reach 15 feet or more.  The flash gives full coverage over large groups of people.  The battery life is a good as the spec's say. I have used the camera all day several times and have not came close to using up the battery.  The battery stands up well to heavy flash use and the battery recovers quickly between flash shots.The photo album is a fun feature for showing friends pictures. The 3 inch screen also helps because several people can view the screen at one time.  The drawing capability is a waste of time for me but a few people may use it.The only low point(maybe) is the thickness when you compare it to the ultra compact camera's on the market. No ultra compact can offer the pictue quality, features and 8.1 MP of the DSC-N1 at this time. The DSC-N1 fits easily in a pocket and can be carried around without catching any swithes on your clothing.I plan on purchasing the marine pack and using this camera for scuba diving.

A 1 GB card can take over 250 pics at max resolution 8 MP; change to VGA and you can take over 6,000 pics.Album - The album organizes pics by date and has an index feature to easily find the pics.  Also, pics deleted from the memory card will still be stored in the album, unless you go in the album and delete it too.  This is the only function I love/hate - to delete you have to do it twice.  The album is cool because you can always go back to your pics for viewing after you transferred to the PC and deleted from the disk.  Plus, it uses minimal storage because the pics are stored as VGA.Slideshow - Very neat transitions and you can download your own slideshow music too.Camera modes -Auto mode works best in light. For low-light, Program and Soft Snap modes work great.What could be improved:Video quality is poor in low-light settings.

It was supposed to be a replacement camera for my old 3MP Canon Elph (awesome camera btw), but instead it's been so much more.  Now that I've had it for a while I can tell you what sets it apart from most of the cameras in its price point.For one, it takes incredible movies (in fine mode).  While a lot of cameras feature movie capture, this one really is like having a full blown DV-camera in your pocket.Secondly, macro.  I'm sorry, but this feature should be standard on a lot of comparably priced cameras out there now.It also takes some of the most accurate photos colorwise.  In my experience, Nikons made skintones look sorta ashen and the Canons were a little over saturated in the reds.  This one is spot on across the board.It also does every other positive thing the previous 50 reviews mentioned.However, at the 5MP and 8MP settings this camera is slow in the shutter speed department.  The Canon Elphs are great for taking fast, from-the-hip candid photos while this one is best suited for stationary set ups.  And even in \"Monitor\" mode some of the pics come out soft if you try taking them while moving.Another thing I've noticed is that is has trouble with backlit subjects when in Auto-Flash mode.  You end up getting a lot of silohuetted subjects unless you reset to Forced-Flash.

I was upgrading from an older Kodak EasyShare CX 6330.  My main reasons for changing were the need for a bigger screen and for faster focus.  I also wanted a smaller camera.  Well, I got two out of three:  bigger screen and smaller camera.  However, the focus is not significantly faster.  With the Kodak, my out of focus pictures were about 1 in 10.  I would say my ratio has gone up to 2 out of 10.  Don't get me wrong, these cameras do focus, but you have to wait for them to do so.  When you are on Broadway waiting for Hugh Jackman or Ralph Fiennes to come out of the stage door, you do not have time to be focusing.  One second too many and you will miss the picture.  While the Sony is a little faster, you have to wait or it will really be out of focus.  Also, I have noticed some graininess in some of the pictures, especially a few taken at night.  I never noticed this with my old Kodak.  The other shock was the date stamp.  Am I the only one that uses this?  The EasyShare Timestamp was yellow, very clear and professional looking.  The Sony time stamp feature is HORRIBLE!!!.  The numbers are sometimes not clear, sometimes they blend into the background and never look professional.  Unbelievable. Also, be prepared to buy additinal memory.  The memory provided with the card is not sufficient to hold all that much.  Finally, sometimes linear objects have a slight zig zag effect (not good and a step down from my Kodak). Still, there are positive qualities to this camera.  The menu is somewhat easier to use, I love the touch screen, and when it is in focus, the pictures looks good.  The screen is large enough to show people pictures on it without having to download.  I also like the videos which look ok (of course, you MUST purchase additional memory to hold any significant amout of video).

The first digital camera I owned only had 1.3 megapixels so as far as I was concerned this one was a big upgrade for me.  I very much wanted to purchase a newer camera but was not impressed with a lot of digitals on the shelves.  So many seem small, the screens hard to view and the buttons are microscopic.  I began reading about the first Cybershots released by Sony after a co-worker showed me hers.  I then spent a lot of time looking to purchase a Cybershot.  I noticed that the N1 and N2 models were still quite popular.  I missed out on a couple of N2 models just because I just wasn't convinced I was going to get a good camera.  In the end I gambled and bought an N1 offered by a seller at the Amazon store.  It's one of the best purchases I've made.  For serious camera users this camera may seem too easy to use.  \"Advanced photographers\" will find something to complain about with this type of camera I'm sure.  But I find this to be a good camera for anyone who doesn't want the headache of something complex.  When I\"m at functions (such as weddings) and want to take photographs I don't want to be bothered with anything complicated.  For me this camera makes taking pictures fun.  I love the simplicity of it and the 3.0 inch monitor makes viewing fun.  Within 10 seconds I can have it connected to my TV to watch slideshows or video I've recorded.  Like any camera you have to be aware of things such as proper lighting/distance to get certain shots. But my non-digital camera days are over thanks to this Cybershot.

I was upgrading from a P10 which is a 5MP point and shoot.  After alot of research we bought the N1.  Overall a fantastic camera.  Unfortunatly after almost 30 days and 750 pictures, I have discovered the camera we had was slightly faulty and was giving consistantly poor focus. This mainly affected us inside a house or building. Also I discovered that inside pics tend to have a lot of shading in the background using the standard flash. If you change it to slow-synchro flash, the pictures often tend to be VERY blurry (due to the slower shutter speed). I found out this is caused by the low ISO setting the N1 defaults to which is 64. ISO 64 looks GREAT in the daylight but causes that dark background inside a room (I suspect Sony realized this which is why the DSC-N2s lowest setting is back to ISO 100). Because of that I increased my rating to 4 STARS from my edited post.  Because of the faulty focus, however, I will probably get the W100 or the N2.

I actually used this camera to shoot the number one mini golf video on the internet (for what it's worth)! Search YouTube for \"Coolest Mini Golf Hole Ever!\" if you want to see an example.My only complaint is of sketchy performance in low light. The flash isn't very powerful, and it is sometimes out-of-sync with the shutter or fires too dim or two bright on my unit.

Taking the same picture with the Sony and then comparing, I find that I like the picture quality of the Canon better.  The Sony seems to have quite a bit of noise in the picture and has brightness issues. Also, the 3x optical zoom is certainly not enough.  Most cameras of this magnitude have some sort of digital zoom in the camera...this one does not.Another con is the lack of viewfinder on the Sony.  With the Sony not having a view finder, you are really having to just 'shoot and pray' that the picture will come out--especially outside because the screen isn't bright enough to really tell.  The screen also has some graininess and noise so its very difficult to take landscape pictures and see what was in focus and what wasn't.However, to end it on a good note, this camera does take great potrait shots and the indifinite depth of view is great.I would recommend spending the same money on an Elph if you want to take better pictures...if you want to impress your friends, get this one.", "Date": "February 16, 2007"}, {"Title": "newest cypershot", "Author": "Lisa F.

I also love the slide show feature. With this, I can present my pictures in an interesting way with music. Also, I can load music onto the camera to be played while showing slide shows. There are four preset ways to show slide shows with music that matches the style. My favorite feature however is the touch screen. With the stylus or your finger, you can navigate using the screen.

I bought it  becasue of the name, and was attracted by the big 3\" LCD screen which I hoped would be easier for older users' eyes. I first used it in my brother's retirement party. All 300 pictures came out with red line across them. My brother and I are bothdisappointed. I thought maybe something wrong with my photo software, ormy be set up the features wrong, because later some pictures turned outto be OK. Now a year after my warranty expires, not only the lines are showing on all my pictures, but all came with red color backgroud.My friend had problem with his Sony lense (different model). He feltlucky because he bought 2 years' extended warrenty, so it can be fixed with no charge. To me, I don't believe a good name should have such a defective item.I had a BAD experience, I will never buy Sony camera.Also, I bought 2 Panasonic HD flat screen TV, (one put in my living room,the other in bedroom), the picture is much better than Sony.I my opion, Sony is not top of the line any more.", "Date": "October 8, 2007"}, {"Title": "Awsome\u00a1\u00a1\u00a1", "Author": "Karla Marioly Castillo Oliva \"Karla C\"", "ReviewID": "R3N593IROOUS5M", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I like it very much this camera ...
