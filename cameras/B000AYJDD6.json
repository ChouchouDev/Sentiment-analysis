The first priority for a snapshot camera is SPEED.  This one has it in spades.  Very fast shot-to-shot and negligible shutter lag.  The first priority for a hobbyist camera is manual control.  The A6x0 has Auto, program and many preset scene modes.  It also has shutter priority, aperture priority and full manual mode.  Computer imaging enthusiasts will be disappointed that the A6x0 cameras do not provide RAW picture format, but it does produce excellent detail in Fine JPEG mode, and I think many in even that group would be satisfied.  The lens is excellent for such a small camera.  It is fast at f4.1 on the telephoto end of the zoom, very important for family photographs outdoors (fewer blurred photos of children or pets at play).  Really good ISO400 results for even more speed.  Color and white balance is excellent, right out of the camera.  Photos are vivid and life-like.  The flash is small, so if you use that a great deal I recommend something like the Sony slave flash which attaches to the tripod fitting on the camera.  The zoom works fast.  The controls are well laid out, and the camera is easy to handle (my hands are fairly long, I'm 6-2).  The menus are easy to use and quick to find.  I have not needed to open the manuals, so I can't comment on those.  The LCD is bright, and preview mode is fast (the swiveling LCD is fantastic).  The optical viewfinder is adequate and bright enough (about 80% coverage, I think).  The camera fits in my shirt pocket, but with quite a bulge.  Buy a larger SD card because the 32mb card with the camera only holds 9 photos at best quality.  AA batteries are convenient.  Get a good set of rechargeable batteries with a set of cheap alkaline for backup, and you are ready to go (good battery life here).  I have not used movie mode and I might never do so, though I hear it is very good; there is a printer output that I do not use; the camera comes with software that I do not use, so I cannot comment on those three things.The door for cable connections is flimsy.  I opened it once and had trouble closing it.  Had to force the top clip to engage.  Buy a card reader ($10 or $20) and forget about the cables.  Overall, great camera and great photos.", "Date": "October 4, 2005"}, {"Title": "Does almost everything well - making it the best choice.", "Author": "Fred Anonymous Smith", "ReviewID": "R3UC0QGSMFNS3A", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "This is an outstanding small camera. It is difficult to call it a \"point and shoot\" considering the number of advanced options. It has most of the core features offered on even upscale 35mm cameras just a decade or so ago, updated for digital. Regardless, those seeking family shapshots will find it very easy to use (the \"basic\" users guide covers everything), while the more advanced features (covered in the \"advanced\" users guide) will appeal to more serious photographers. In addition to the standard shooting modes (full auto, aperture priority, shutter priority, full manual, and so on), one will find complete control of white balance, numerious pre-programmed color modes along with full color adjustment, the ability to use auxiliary lenses and filters, and more.Picture quality is impressive for such a small camera - better than any 35mm point & shoot camera ever used. Images are sharp, with colors vivid and accurate. Focus and exposure metering are spot on (even more so with spot metering and selectable metering zones available). Lens aberrations (barrel distortion and edge blurriness) are virtually undetectable in \"real-world\" photos. Purple fringing, a problem with some digital CCD sensors, is not a major issue here.The flash is perhaps the weakest point of this camera. Not horrible, but obviously could be better. Like most compact cameras, red-eye with flash pictures can be a problem. There is a red-eye reducing flash mode and the camera has a built-in filter to address this, but neither fully eliminated the problem with all subjects. An external slave flash, such as the Canon HF-DC1 or more fully featured Metz 28 CS-2, may offer some relief in this regard. But, even if one eliminates the red-eye problem, the flash is still too weak, located too close to the lense, and not automated enough - too often resulting in over-exposures, vignetting with close subjects (even more so with the conversion lenses), and not enough light for distant subjects. One is almost forced into existing light photography with this camera, but the results are certainly worth it.The Canon .45x wide angle (WC-DC58N) and 1.7x telephoto (TC-DC58N) conversion lenses are a blast to use. As explained in the \"advanced\" users guide, these require a special lense adapter (sold separately) attached using the bayanet mount hidden under the large metal ring at the base of the primary lense. The ring is removed by pressing silver button on camera body to the bottom right of the lense. These two increase coverage from 24mm wide angle to about 245mm telephoto. However, vignetting prevents the use of the entire zoom range. With the telephoto, for example, vignetting starts just below 80-90mm, limiting use to above that - offering a zoom range with the conversion lens of roughly 180-245mm. The lense adapter also accepts standard 58mm filters, but many (light correction, color effects, and so on) can be simulated in the camera.I did extensive research (magazine and user reviews, as well as several trips to the camera store) before deciding on this particular camera. In that process, I was able to narrow the list of possibles down to six - this camera, the FinePix E900 (weak low light focusing), the PowerShot S80 (strange lens adapter and too easy to accidently turn on), the Cybershot DSC-V3 (discontinued in this market, but still available if one hunts), the Olympus SP-350 (somewhat sluggish performance), and the Pentax Optio 750z (weak viewfinder, weak focusing, and somewhat sluggish performance). None of these other cameras performed especially poorly, which is why they made it into the final selection list. So, even with the minor issues noted, any of them would be a good choice. However, this camera, the PowerShot A620, just seemed to do almost everything well - ultimately making it the best choice in this camera category.Note: Several reviewers here have expressed doubts about the soft plastic door over the USB and A/V connectors. When I mentioned this to a repair tech at a local camera shop, he allowed me to try pulling the door off a store damaged camera (dropped flat on it's face on the hard tile covered cement floor). While I'm sure the door will come off if pulled hard enough, it is a lot tougher than it appears.", "Date": "June 15, 2006"}, {"Title": "Excellent Camera, A Great Value!", "Author": "Anthony Pantliano \"The Photo Guy\"", "ReviewID": "R28A6X7QB28P2N", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I bought this camera to replace my digital Olympus C-4000.

It also has a 4x optical zoom based on the lens in the Powershot G6, and the macro mode can focus down to 0.4 inches. It is great that the camera runs on AA batteries, and has excellent battery life.  Photo quality has been terrific, with sharp, colorful pictures.

G. CHARLOT", "ReviewID": "RHVFQI3DPCNYI", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I purchased my A-620 specifically for use underwater in a Canon WP-DC90 housing. I needed an u/w camera system with both still and video capability that met my $750 budget, and the A-620 with housing was actually $100 less than that, including a 2 gig SD card for $135. As of June 2006, the camera's street price has dropped more than $100 from it's introduction, making it a real bargain if you like it's features. For full techno review, see the reviews in DPREVIEW or DCRESOURCE, but here's my two cents worth:What I like about the A-620:1. Uses good ol' \"AA\" NIMH batteries. I hate proprietary power packs that you can usually only buy mail order or from camera stores at three or four times the cost of a set of AA's.2. Fully point-and-shoot if I just want snapshots or my wife is using the camera (she is a techno-phobe who fears complexity in any gadget). But when I need to be more specific about settings, or the lighting is poor, the camera has full manual exposure and manual focus controls. In normal daylight conditions, Program mode takes very nice pictures. For conditions where I need a lot of depth-of-field, I can use Aperture priority at f7.1 or f8.3. VGA movie mode. Excellent video quality for this camera's price point. The audio quality isn't great - get a real camcorder if you want good sound - but for underwater use audio was irrevelant since I added my own separate music track in post-production. The finished video DVD from my Cozumel dive trip was incredibly good; I would have had to spend many thousands of dollars on professional gear to get any substantial increase in quality of the video image.4. Available waterproof housing for under $175, good to 130' for recreational scuba diving.5. Build quality very good (except for the I/O compartment door), camera's control dial and buttons have a nice feel to them.6. Reliable image quality. Camera rarely makes auto focus or exposure errors in the automatic modes.What I don't like about the A-620:Actually, there is little to complain about. For this camera's very low retail price, it has tremendous capabilities, especially when U/W capability is your primary concern. It would have been near perfect if it had the following features: RAW image output, 28 mm wide angle instead of 35mm.My main gripes: The lens zoom has only 9 discrete steps; I wish there were more steps or better yet a stepless zoom.The lens can not be zoomed while shooting video. According to Canon, the reason for locking the zoom in video mode is to not have the zoom motor's noise on the audio track. For underwater video, this would not be a problem since there is no ambient sound to be recorded anyway (the camera is in a sealed housing). IMO, the video zoom lockout should be something that the user can enable or disable as a menu choice.Summary: Outstanding value for a compact, the A-620 offers a really nice suite of features, very good image quality, and with the addition of the WP-DC90 housing for $160US, it is one of the BEST (maybe THE best) underwater camera systems available for ameteur use. Keep in mind that even a teaspoonfull of salt water leaking through a microscopic defect in a housing seal will usually destroy a digital camera. With the A-620, you lose a $225 camera. With a DSLR, say a Canon D-20, you lose a camera body and lens worth maybe $1800. And as any scuba diver will tell you, there are two types of underwater photographers: those who have already lost a camera to a housing leak, and those who are waiting for their turn to lose one. I highly recommend the A-620 and WP-DC90 housing. Even for use on dry land, the A-620 is a really nice small camera that fits in a jacket pocket. Most photographers that have advanced past the novice level may find the 4x zoom range too limiting, in which case the super-zoom cameras may be more appealing (many brands and models available).For regular use, I will probably replace my aging Minolta 7I with a Fuji S-9000, which is similar in many ways - it uses Compact Flash cards, AA batteries, and has a manual zoom ring. I will then reserve the A-620 for u/w use on dive trips. NOTE: The WP-DC90 housing is specifically fitted for the A-620 and does not fit any other camera.Problems1. Very occasional auto-focus errors even in full daylight, but only perhaps 1 in 200 shots (0.5%). By contrast, my Minolta DImage 7I produces auto focus errors on about 15% of shots.2. The cover for the I/O ports is a soft plastic and doesn't firmly snap into place, it is frequently flopping loose and I suppose it will eventually break off completely.3. The power button is too exposed and it is too easy for it to get pressed by other objects in a camera bag. This could cause damage to the lens or the motor drive that extends it if the camera is tightly fitted in the bag and the lens can not freely extend. This problem can be avoided by storing the camera with the play/record switch in \"play\" position, or of course by removing the batteries (not very convienient).4. Camera flash has pretty good power output for a compact, but produces lots of red-eye in photos of people or family pets (esprcially cats). The in-camera red-eye reduction feature doesn't seem to help much. I guess red-eye can be removed by most PP utilities.I consider these problems to be MINOR and they should not be construed as a reason to avoid this camera. At it's current street price of $225, it is an outstanding value (I paid $350 in October 2005).

Compared to the Olympus C-4000Z which I've used previously, the most striking difference is that the A620 is so fast and easy to control.It takes only a few clicks of the arrow buttons on the back of the camera to set up everything from custom white balance to shutter delay.  I haven't yet found controls for saturation and sharpness, but I don't think I'll need them.The movie mode is very nice, at 640x480 and 30fps.  The results look just as sharp as those from my Sony Digital-8 camcorder, though of course the A620 won't let you use the optical zoom while recording.  The audio does seem to pick up a hum from the camera itself.The camera's sensor resolution is about 7MP, and the optics must be good: 5x7\" prints (from a Canon i960) show excellent detail.  I haven't yet tried printing at 8x10.I've yearned for a digital camera which would produce the levels of shadow detail one sees in an Ansel Adams print -- the kind of detail that draws the viewer in ever closer until his or her nose is almost on the paper.  I'm just getting started with the A620, but for small prints and low ISO settings it looks like it could do the trick!The A620 uses AA batteries.  Pick up a set of NiMH batteries and a recharger (the camera comes with 4 Panasonic alkaline batteries) and you'll be all set.I'm not sure how quickly the batteries drain.  So far I've gotten nearly 100 photos and a couple of minutes of video from a set of 2000 mAh Radio Shack NiMH batteries, charged once.The camera comes with a 32MB SD card.  You can't get very many high-resolution photos on such a tiny card.  (And I think you could fill it with less than 30 seconds of video.)  I bought a 512MB SD card, which should have room for about 150 photos.  I'm not sure how much Motion-JPEG video it will hold.The included USB cable works without a hitch.  The A620 supports USB 2.0, so it transfers photos and movies quickly.  However, the plastic door which covers the camera's USB port is flimsy, and it interferes with the camera's wrist strap.  A separate USB 2.0 SD card reader would probably be more durable.A lens adapter and accessory telephoto and wide-angle lenses are available for the A620.  I've ordered the lens adapter and a 58 mm rubber lens hood, which I hope will let me take glare-free photos through the side window of my airplane.  The adapter is threaded, so it should also accept polarizing filters.The A620 will fit in a coat or vest pocket.  It will even fit in a shirt pocket, but it'll cause a significant bulge -- and a sag: it's pretty heavy :)  If you want a pocket camera you might want to consider another model/brand.This was a gift, but I think it's amazing that you can get so much camera for less than $400.Cons: small included SD card, flimsy USB adapter cover, some audio hum in movies, may be too large for some tastes.Pros: fast, easy to control, sharp focus, great detail, good movie quality, AA batteries, lens accessories, great price.", "Date": "December 30, 2005"}, {"Title": "This is a GREAT digital camera", "Author": "Myron Baer", "ReviewID": "R1NH03A9F6S3VS", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I've had Olympus and Fuji lower pixel cameras but the A620 at 7 megapixels is absolutely great.  As an amateur professional with lots of heavy Nikon SLR bodies, lenses and equipment, this Canon is now my choice of cameras 80% of the time.Its color and whiteness balance are beautiful right out of the box.  The controls are extremely easy to use for experienced photographers though the manual is needed if you are new to this technology.  Be patient with the manual-it's not the best one but if you take your time it all comes together.I found most pictures shot MUCH better with slight tweaking of the aperature and ISO rather than the flash which tends to make the pictures way too contrasty for my liking.Contrary to other writeups Ive seen, the flash can be shut off.  The camera is extremely comfortable and lightweight though this is not a mini camera for those looking for that kind of body.  The zoom is great but too short on focal length (only 114mm).The camera shoots and writes to memory quickly and I purchased a fast 1gb card-something you will defintely need for a trip.  The cover for the USB and other electrical hookups is an absolute piece of garbage.  How Canon puts that on an otherwise excellent piece of equipment is beyond anyones imagination.The other great feature I specifically looked for is a bright LCD that is movable so you can shoot very low or very high angles.  Not only does it swivel but when finished shooting, the screen can be turned INTO the camera, protecting it from those nasty scratches you get when carrying it around.All in all- for the price-pick one up at Amazon-it was cheaper than anyone else, including my beloved B&H; Photo.", "Date": "May 30, 2006"}, {"Title": "Excellent everyday camera", "Author": "A Reviewer", "ReviewID": "R2PIBB9JJTB21Z", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "Likes - Bright swivel screen.

Available bayonet lens accessories (filters wideange etc.) - I have Lensmate adapter and polarizing filter. Silent mode. Good battery life. Takes great pictures. Takes good video with acceptable audio.Dislikes - Mostly minor issues. A bit heavy. Requires 4 batteries - why it's heavy. AV door is placed under thumb so comes open in use. AV and memory doors are flimsy. Too easy to accidentally change modes taking in and out of camera bag.  Cannot force flash on in AUTO mode - have to switch to Program, logical but annoying.  No secondary display for mode, battery, picture count - have to open screen.  Built in flash does not work well with lens accessories and there is no external flash synch.  No remote.Overall I'm very happy with it and recommend it if you are looking for this class of camera.  The main reason I bought this particular model is the swivel screen and its ability to use accessories.  If the swivel screen is not important to you - I find it essential and now hardly use the viewfinder - the Canon A700 might be a better choice - 6X zoom, larger screen and only 2 AA batteries.I recommend you buy a 1G fast SD card (eg. Sandisk ultra II) - maybe larger if you plan to take much video.  I bought a 512M card to start and found I filled it up too fast.

Yoh \"Techno Geek\"", "ReviewID": "RPM74MGBL4MWK", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "I already have the semi-Professional level Canon EOS 20 D of which I love very much but its weight and bulkiness did not encourage me to take candid shots wherever I go.So I researched a small portable digital camera that I could take with me. I was tossing between this A620 and the SD500 Elph.I chose the A620 based on features and the rave review that an online camera review did (dpreview dot com).I ordered it online and once I received it, I was surprised at its size (it would certainly help to see it in physical stores!) and it was not a shirt pocket camera that I was picturing. It could fit in my jacket pockets but I think it will rip my shirt pocket trying to stuff that thing in.I decided to keep it because it did take great pictures. That is the main function of a camera, right? Take good pictures!!!After getting a small camera case, the portability was not too bad after all. It is definitely much lighter than the Canon EOS 20D (and thousand dollar less to boot).But there is no question that I had been spoiled by Canon EOS 20D. The focusing was slower, and it took me longer to take shots. But definitely much faster than my Minolta Dimage 7 (5 megapixel) that I paid one thousand dollars at the local Sam's Club several years back.I found that the positive for this camera is that it takes great pictures with AUTO.I found that when I used the zoom lens inside a building with medium light, I did get some blurry shots but the Camera warned  with the shake symbol. It is nice that the camera warns  you. That tells me that instead of zoom, I should physcally come closer to the subject and then take pictures.I found that it is possible to turn off the flash (by changing the setting from AUTO to something else like LANDSCAPE). But invariably you will get blurry pictures in a medium light enviroment unless you take it with a tripod.The other thing that attracted me to this camera vs the other ones was that it used AA batteries. I mean, you can get AA batteries anywhere in the world! And with the ubiquitous rechargeable batteries, you are set! I have noticed that with my 2500 mAh rechargeable batteries I was able to take quite a few pictures, show off the results to folks on the flippable LCD screen and it was couple months before the battery was totally out. Which was NOT BAD at all!The fact that this camera uses SD chip is also a great feature. SD chip has come down in price trememdously in the past few days. I just got a 4 gig SD chip with 150 X speed for less than one hundred bucks with shipping and tax!!! One could get about 1000 pictures at the highest resolution!!! Ironically, SD chips are now cheaper than Compact Flash for slightly faster speed. I don't know how can they fit 4 gig in that small space...The video option is a Bonus extra for me and I thought it took surprisingly good video considering the size and the lens of the camera. In a dark room, it does not come out well. It needs bright light enviroment. So for a small camera that you can take videos...that is not too bad. Of course it will not be professional looking and all that...for that I have the Canon XL1S. But for special candid moments or unexpected situations, it is great to be able to get a video of something that is viewable on computer or TV.I do like this camera!", "Date": "May 27, 2006"}, {"Title": "Excellent Camera For The Price!", "Author": "JR \"jrwebfx\"", "ReviewID": "R1U7B3WRFK4SD9", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I owned a Canon G2, 4 megapixel camera for a couple years prior to looking for a replacement.  I looked at other brands, but ask any camera aficionado, and they will tell you, \"Canon is the best brand.\" I compared many cameras, and almost bought the PowerShot S70, but am glad I did not for the following reasons:+ I like the feel of a more professional camera like the A620+ You don't have to use rechargable batteries!! I didn't realize how inconvenient rechargables are until you have the choice; this camera is one of the few I have seen that takes regular AA batteries! If ever you run low on power, every corner store in the world has AA's!  (No more running to the re-charger).+ Fast processor: The DigicII chip it comes with is amazing! Coming from the G2, it feels almost as fast as a camera worth 5x more!  (Extremely fast start-up times too).+ Awesome picture quality: I can't believe I waited this long to buy an upgrade; most of my G2's pictures were blurry... NOW maybe 1 in 100 pictures are a bit off-focus, but not even that bad.  Just great looking, true-color & sharp resolution pictures.+ Price! For all the features, I was prepared to spend at least twice as much.+ Lightweight, small (but not too small), and compact + great battery-life.  The lens retracts nicely too; so no lens cap needed like the old G2.Some cons?:- Wish the grip was rubberized like some more professional cameras, but it's still ergonomic so it's not that bad.- Flash is good, but not \"great.\"  It is fine for 95% of the shots, but on longer dark rooms, the shot still comes out a bit dark.  I didn't try tweeking the +/- settings, so it is possible that could be overcome.- No \"Bulb\" setting.  I liked my \"B\" setting on my old 35mm camera and kind of miss that feature.  The longest shutter time offered on this camera is \"15-seconds,\" which for most will be fine.I can't think of any other \"cons\"... This is just a great little camera, and one I expect will last me at least another 2 years.

Four years ago, I went digital with an Olympus 3.2 megapixel Camedia. Love that camera, but started having problems (over-exposure in all modes, and contrast off especially in macro. After six months of study, I decided on the A620, and am moderately happy with my decision.I should explain that, no matter how much investigating you do, you'll never know if you made the right decision. When I bought the Olympus, the choices were limited to perhaps four 3+ megapixel cameras. Now, with a hundred choices, your chances of getting the ideal camera are slim IF you know digital cameras at all. Sometimes, ignorance is bliss.A620 pros: Easy to use. Menus are well laid out, though the primary button on the back of the camera could have \"easier\" more readable buttons. But once you get used to them, they're fine. Love the various special effects that you can add to your pictures. And even the movie mode will give a decent movie if you have a 1 gig card.The LCD is fantastic, and revolved 180 degrees. Not that I expected to take a self-portrait, but I actually have used the easy-to-see (in most any light) LCD for all kinds of shots.The viewfinder (a must for those of you who are looking at any digital camera) is good, and off by only a degree or two.Pictures are sharp and the lens is as good as Olympus Zuiko, and that's going some.Before I forget, I'd give Canon an A+ on its software. It is downright simple and though I might have to use Thumbs+ or Photoshop for minor tweaking, this software is a snap on layouts and printing. Many who have written about Canon's software call it \"weak\" or \"for beginners only.\" Well, I'm no beginner, and it's a pleasure to get a composite print or contact sheet set up and printed in 5 minutes.Portraits and landscapes are excellent. Closeups...see below.It's fast.It has the feel of a 35mm camera. It has some weight and it's comfortable.The zoom is very good.Cons: Can't turn off flash in Auto mode.The macro is trickier than the Olympus and doesn't always produce good results. One trick is that you press the shutter button half-way before taking the picture, and you'll get better focus. Half of my pictures are macros, and I've been somewhat disappointed. I think that going to the manual mode is the solution, and that may put off most who go the digital route for more than just point and shoot.The warning light for using a tripod seemingly comes on 80% of the time. Admittedly, we've had rain in California since I bought the camera, but I have no trouble keeping the camera steady and, in low light suituations, letting the flash do the rest.I'd recommend the camera, but if you're looking for one that you can just tuck in your shirt pocket, this isn't for you.", "Date": "April 11, 2006"}, {"Title": "Fast startup, excellent macro, many features, Fairly big camera", "Author": "Hsiang-ming Wang \"simbawang\"", "ReviewID": "R30GMY6FUYW8C7", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "There are two things I don't like about this camera one is the size and the other is the high background noise during video mode (Anyone else also experienced this?).

I Love it. Excellent all around. For full reviews I suggest you google \"Canon A620 review\". My only complaint is the I/O port cover is flimsy in comparison to how solid and well built the rest of the camera is.Don't forget to get high speed memory for it.

Fouts", "ReviewID": "R1V9MS3UHF2772", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "Having used two other digital cameras for the past 4 years, I was forced to buy a new one when the last one stopped working properly. I spent hours looking at options and features and comparing prices.  I could not be happier with the Canon Powershot A620.  After reading some of the reviews that talk about the large size of the camera, and the flimsy door that covers the data port, I was not getting my hopes built up too far until the camera arrived.  This camera is smaller than my last one, and fits very nicely in your hands and is comfortable and easy to handle.  As for the flimsy door, get over it.  It serves its purpose and as long as you don't treat it like it's made of steel, it will probably be fine.  Now, all that out of the way, here's what I really think.  For less than $300, I bought the camera and a 1G SD Memory Card.  In a resolution much higher than is necessary for 4.5x6\" snap shots, I can take more than 500 photos on the card.  I played with the camera for more than a week before the AA batteries started going dead.  Now, we've been more than two weeks on the rechargeable batteries, without being recharged.  We have stored close to 250 photos, and probably taken twice that while learning what all the camera can do.  It does have some nice, fancy features, but it's also easy to use for someone who wants to just point and shoot.  However, the camera does have its way of telling you where it is focusing or if it is in danger of being blurred by shaky hands.  If you watch for this, you can readjust before taking a picture.  One thing that I am the most pleased with is the speed of turning on the camera and shooting the first picture, and any subsequent pictures after that.  FAST!!!  (For a digital camera)  I would say it's less than 2 seconds from the time you turn the camera on, until it has flashed the 1st picture if you can move your fingers that fast.  There is a way to turn the review off so it's instantly ready for the next picture.  It is taking me a little time to get used to what the camera prioritizes for aperture and shutter speed, but I am not disappointed with the camera at all.  Another thing I really like is the swivel ability of the LCD screen.  I hope this helps someone else make the decision easier than I did.", "Date": "July 3, 2006"}, {"Title": "My dream digital camera!", "Author": "Book lover", "ReviewID": "R2W2X0SZ7T8GCT", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I feel I'm a pretty good photographer.

I thought that was the only way to get professional looking photos, but I was pleasantly surprised that this little camera does all the things the larger more expensive cameras can do.  Another plus is its fast.  Powering up, taking the photos, and loading on my computer.  I love the speed.  I was able to keep up with my kids cute poses while at the park.  I was amazed.

I can't comment on whether it would suit the needs of experienced photographers.  I bought an A620 a month ago, in anticipation of a vacation, and can offer the following observations:(1)  This camera is quite easy to use as a point-and-shoot.  The instruction manual will have you up and shooting within 5 minutes of opening the box.  Understanding more of the camera's features will require an evening or two with the manual.  The camera has both a variety of automatic settings (an all-purpose \"auto\" plus settings for indoor, beach, fireworks, pets, etc.) and also allows extensive direct control of various parameters, which will undoubtedly be enjoyable to learn.  In short, this is easy to use immediately but offers plenty of room to grow.(2)  Features that are important, or not:  (a)  Megapixels:  7 megs appears to be more than a vacation photographer really needs -- photos at this level appear suitable for conversion into poster-size prints.  However, both image size and resolution can be set lower; a 1 GB memory card can hold several hundred pictures at the 4x6 snapshot quality.  (Note that one absolutely must buy a larger memory card than the very small one included with the camera, which only holds a handful of photos.  A 1 GB card will add about $50 to the overall price.)  (b)  Heft:  This camera is too big to fit in a pocket, but not at all heavy carried in a shoulder pouch.  I found the mini cameras I sampled too small to get an easy grip on.  The A620 fits very nicely in the hand and can be gripped firmly (important for non-blurry shots) by the side compartment.  The battery compartment and cable compartment doors are amazingly flimsy -- especially when you first open the box, be very careful installing the batteries since the door looks like it will break in a moment if moved the wrong way.  The door over the cable connections is simply a cheap fold of rubber, which I suspect will have fallen off within a year.  (c)  LCD and viewfinder:  Not all digital cameras have traditional viewfinders.  The A620 does.  I think a viewfinder is essential, since the LCD cannot always be viewed, especially in bright outdoor light.  Note that the viewfinder on the A620 is slightly offset from the camera lens, so photos taken using the viewfinder will be \"off\" a bit.  This is something one either needs to learn to adjust for, or plan on doing some cropping on the PC later.  The LCD on the A620 swivels out, which is very handy.  Not only does this protect the LCD (by folding it in when the camera's not in use), but the LCD can be angled in various ways to help take shots aimed low or high, or flipped all the way around for the inevitable self-protraits.  (d)  Batteries:  This uses 4 AA batteries.  I used the same 4 throughout my 2-week vacation and they are still going strong.  One should get a set of rechargeable AA's and a good charger (this will add another $40 or so if you don't scrimp).  I wanted a camera that uses AA's since my main interest in having a camera is travel photos, and AA's are available everywhere.  (e)  Movies:  The A620 can shoot nice quality video, although the sound quality suffers from an unavoidable motor-like background sound.  (f)  Zoom:  Digital cameras advertise both digital and optical zoom.  I understand now the difference between the two, and can summarize it in lay terms:  Optical zoom is \"real\" zoom, performed with the lens, and digital zoom is, in effect, an auto-blur feature.  I find the digital zoom useful for using the camera in a pinch as a pair of binoculars, but only the optical zoom produces nice photos.  This is also where the 7 megs come in useful:  photos taken at very high resolution provide amazing detail, so the best way to get a close-up is to combine the optical zoom at high resolution with subsequent PC zooming and cropping.  I had hoped for more than a 4X optical zoom, but that turns out to be hard to find on digital cameras without adding more weight than I wanted.  (g)  Connections:  The camera interacts with your PC and TV through cables plugged in on the side.  Downloading the contents of a full 1 GB card to my PC via the USB cable took only a few moments.  The bundled software is easy to use for storing photos on your PC; it can tell which photos you've already downloaded from your camera.  The software includes only a few editing features.  For backing up photos onto CD, the bundled software worked poorly, but this task was easy to accomplish with the CD-burning software that came with my PC's CD-burner (Sonic).  Interestingly, lower resolution photos look much nicer on a TV screen than higher resolution ones.  (h)  Fun stuff:  There are settings for stitching together landscapes, making sepia and B&W; photos, and (my favorite) swapping colors, so you can, e.g. see what your cat would look like if she were the color of your car.(3)  Key lesson learned:  A nice side-effect of only having 27 shots on a disposable camera was the importance that gets placed on each shot.  With my new digital camera, I took an awful lot of bad pictures on my vacation.  I wasn't used to the idea that every shot can be immediately checked, and not patient enough in setting up shots in the first place.  By making it almost TOO easy to take pictures, a digital camera also makes it too easy not to put any thought into them.(4)  Conclusion:  Overall I'm very happy with the A620.  I dropped a star since I think Canon knows how to build more solid compartment doors -- there shouldn't be anything flimsy on a product like this.  Otherwise I think this is a great starter camera, which should keep snapshot photographers happy for a long time.", "Date": "July 17, 2006"}, {"Title": "Best Camera I've ever owned...", "Author": "Barbara A.

I was ready to buy a Nikon Coolpix S5 when I visited my local camera store and the salesman showed me the Canon Powershot A620.His main objection to the Nikon was there was no viewfinder. The LCD display would wash out on a sunny day. The A620 has both and the A620's LCD display is adjustable to a zillion different positions. Right then and there I was sold.The A620 is bigger and easier to hold. The hump for the batteries also adds extra finger grip for holding it. The shutter button is large and away from the other buttons.The A620 uses 4 AA batteries. At first I thought this was a negative. But the saleman said it was a positive. If the batteries are dead, in a jam its easier to buy AA batteries than special photographic batteries. He sold me a AA rapid battery recharger which includes NiMH batteries. I can also use it for my Garmin i5 PND (personal navigation device).I have read some reviews that feel a camera that uses two AA batteries is better than one that uses four. Do they realize that four batteries last twice as long as two?The A620 is a 7 Megapixel camera, the S5 was 6 Megapixels. The A620 has a 4x zoom optical lens, the S5 was 3x.I bought a one Gigabyte SD memory card for storing pictures. At 7 Megapixels per picture, it holds 320 pictures.The only problem I have is that I am not familar with Canon cameras and the instruction manual isn't very clear. I've had to figure things out through trial and error. I had no problems figuring out how to turn the flash off as this was identical to the Nikon.

Four years ago, I went digital with an Olympus 3.2 megapixel Camedia. Love that camera, but started having problems (over-exposure in all modes, and contrast off especially in macro. After six months of study, I decided on the A620, and am moderately happy with my decision.I should explain that, no matter how much investigating you do, you'll never know if you made the right decision. When I bought the Olympus, the choices were limited to perhaps four 3+ megapixel cameras. Now, with a hundred choices, your chances of getting the ideal camera are slim IF you know digital cameras at all. Sometimes, ignorance is bliss.A620 pros: Easy to use. Menus are well laid out, though the primary button on the back of the camera could have \"easier\" more readable buttons. But once you get used to them, they're fine. Love the various special effects that you can add to your pictures. And even the movie mode will give a decent movie if you have a 1 gig card.The LCD is fantastic, and revolved 180 degrees. Not that I expected to take a self-portrait, but I actually have used the easy-to-see (in most any light) LCD for all kinds of shots.The viewfinder (a must for those of you who are looking at any digital camera) is good, and off by only a degree or two.Pictures are sharp and the lens is as good as Olympus Zuiko, and that's going some.Before I forget, I'd give Canon an A+ on its software. It is downright simple and though I might have to use Thumbs+ or Photoshop for minor tweaking, this software is a snap on layouts and printing. Many who have written about Canon's software call it \"weak\" or \"for beginners only.\" Well, I'm no beginner, and it's a pleasure to get a composite print or contact sheet set up and printed in 5 minutes.Portraits and landscapes are excellent. Closeups...see below.It's fast.It has the feel of a 35mm camera. It has some weight and it's comfortable.The zoom is very good.Cons: Can't turn off flash in Auto mode.The macro is trickier than the Olympus and doesn't always produce good results. One trick is that you press the shutter button half-way before taking the picture, and you'll get better focus. Half of my pictures are macros, and I've been somewhat disappointed. I think that going to the manual mode is the solution, and that may put off most who go the digital route for more than just point and shoot.The warning light for using a tripod seemingly comes on 80% of the time. Admittedly, we've had rain in California since I bought the camera, but I have no trouble keeping the camera steady and, in low light suituations, letting the flash do the rest.I'd recommend the camera, but if you're looking for one that you can just tuck in your shirt pocket, this isn't for you.", "Date": "June 29, 2006"}, {"Title": "Great Compact Camera", "Author": "Ryan Lynch", "ReviewID": "RR3P0JBF6OMD", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I own a Canon Digital Rebel XT, But I always don't want to carry that around everywhere I go.

While indeed larger than Canon's popular Elph line of cameras, the A620 is not the tank it appears in the photograph. In giving up the slim design, the user gets total customizability. Whereas minicameras, such as the Elphs, offer simplicity in their \"point-and-shoot\" design, the A620 goes a step further.Now, I must stress that this camera absolutely has point-and-shoot usability. In fact, the speed at which the thing powers up very much impressed me: from touching the power button, I can comfortably move my finger to the shutter, depress it, and the photo is taken. No more missed shots waited for the camera to turn on!So the A620 does all the slimmer models do, just in a slightly wider package. The benefits, however, are great: 4 AA batteries means greater power and longer life; manual adjustment of settings, such as shutter speed, aperture value, and focus depth; fold-out LCD screen, useful for odd camera angles, such as shots low to the ground (also means the LCD can be protected when camera is not in use; very handy to me, as I bought the A620 to replace my old digital camera, whose screen had cracked while in my backpack!); 4x zoom rather than 3x, means you'll be doing less cropping to get the shot you want--and remember that in digital photography, cropping means a loss of quality.If those facts aren't enough to convince you to accept an extra half inch or so of casing, maybe the camera isn't for you. I for one bought it because it was cheaper than the comparable--and also because it's not quite as girlie. ;) After having it only a week, I was already experimenting with the different manual settings, and found myself able to execute shots simply not possible from using the point-and-shoot setting, such as focusing on obscure part of the picture, or placing the camera on a tripod and taking a picture of the night sky with the shutter left open for 15 seconds. Beautiful!Couldn't be more impressed with this model. Don't buy something simpler and limit yourself!One more piece of advice: I bought the cheapest 1GB card available, about $10 or $15, and it works splendidly with this camera.

The picture quality is excellent with accurate color and sharp images.  I have not noticed any purple fringing.  The barrel distortion at wide-open can be seen if you look for it, but is not noticible in telephoto (this is typical of all telephoto cameras)  It is fast, especially when using the continuous shooting feature.  I have been able to get good pictures of the kid's basketball activity at ISO 200 in a fairly dark gym without the flash by using the continuous shooting.  This model has a huge advantage over the 540 because it has 4 AA batteries instead of two.  As a result, the flash powers up quickly and allows you to take shots without waiting for 10-20 seconds.  It also seems to last forever with 2400 mAh ni-mh batteries.  The LCD display is easy to see indoors and out and has one of the best features of this camera, something that all digital cameras should have.  Being able to rotate the display so that you can hold this camera over your head and over the crowd and still see what you are shooting is very useful.  Point and shoot automatic mode works great, but I usually use the A, or aperature priority mode.  There is visible noise in the images at ISO 400, but it's a good thing to have when shooting in dark places where other cameras won't let you get a shot at all.  The flash is positioned off to the side enough that you won't always get red-eye, but not enough that red-eye won't be an issue in some of your pictures.  (Photoshop Elements works very well for eliminating red-eye)This camera has a mode where you can take a series of pictures for a panaramic shot and then stitch the images together later.

However, what i am very dissapointed in is the construction of the camera.  Notice that most digi camera under 250.00 do not offer 7 Megapixles.  that is reserved for the higher priced cameras.  The reason canon was able to do this is simply in the body construction.  PLASTIC - and alot of it.  Its flimsy feeling plastic.  the A95 had a much more sturdy feel than the A620 especially in the pop out LCD.  the cover for the ports on the camera (USB, Power...) is very poorly designed.  Its a rubber/plastic type piece that is made to fit over the ports but never seems to want to stay - theres no latch or way to secure it.  The A95 had the ports scattered all over the camera, which I liked, it allowed me to have more than one cord plugged into the camera without trying to shove them into one small space all together.  the rubber piece covering the A95's ports were alot more effective.  I have No idea why they decided to go with the SD memory type instead of sticking with the compact flash.  that just boggles my mind.  Anyhow...Performance wise the A620 reminds me very much of the A95.  the menus are familiar and the options are a plenty.  I like being able to control how the camera focuses, where it focuses and the grip/LCD combo makes it easy to take interesting angle shots where as other cameras have the LCD fixed on the back of the camera (how are you going to take that myspace picture without a mirror or flip around LCD screen...HMMm???).  The image quality is what you'd expect.  Im not sure if the images Look Better but u can certainly zoom closer into them without getting any pixles.  I would say it hosts about the same amount of colors.  speaking of colors..the \"my colors\" option on the camera is pretty neat.  Change any color to another or accent any color you want.  Now you can also set your own white balance (an advanced feature only enthusiests would want to use)...im tired..i have nothing else to say...If you are an enthusiest with a very limited budget I wouldnt look further than this camera.  theres no two ways about it.  its an amazing price for a VERY versitile camera (most digi's arent even this versatile untill you get to the SLR range.)", "Date": "July 26, 2006"}, {"Title": "Great Camera Great Value", "Author": "Rodney E.

I play with light settings constantly, and often settle on ISO400, since it seems to take the best pictures, but when you come back home and look at it on the camera, it's noticeably very noisy. Love this camera. It gives the perfect mix of automated camera settings and the power to play with everything. I am pretty picky when it comes to how the light looks in my photos, so I love how I can set certain settings fixed (like aperture or exposure) and then let the camera figure out the rest, letting me create exactly the kind of effect I want for a series of shots without having to spend a minute fiddling with the camera before each one. Auto mode is kind of all-right, but generally I set the camera once for a certain light level, and then leave it in fixed aperture or fixed exposure mode for the duration I'm at a place.Love this camera. Replaced my Kodak Easyshot with it, which took terrible terrible indoor shots, and have never looked back.", "Date": "November 23, 2006"}, {"Title": "Awesome camera!", "Author": "Deanokat", "ReviewID": "R1Q619OI1X0F28", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I'm 45 years old and have owned two cameras in my life. So I guess that doesn't make me an expert or anything. My previous camera was a Canon Powershot film camera, purchased 17 years ago for about $150 at Target. And it still works great. People always have said, \"That camera takes great pictures.\" I felt like a genius, but really just bought it because it was on sale. After finally converting over to Macs and loving the iPhoto software, I decided to go digital. I automatically started looking at Canons because of the years of pleasure my other Canon gave me. I stumbled across this camera at Amazon and figured a 4.5 star average rating with 199 customer reviews had to mean it was decent. And I also read great reviews of it elsewhere. So I decided to take the plunge. Funny thing...I must've got one of the last ones of these that Amazon itself was selling. Because the price on the descriptioin page when I went to put it in my cart was $329.99. But when I added it to my cart, the price changed to $214.99...and I have no idea why. I was worried that I was gonna get some camera that was returned or something, but the customer service rep at Amazon said that that wasn't the case...that mine was a brand new camera. When it came, sure enough...it was brand new. I've only used it for about 5 days, but I love everything about it. Even the 2\" screen seems plently big enough for me. The pictures are fabulous. And I was able to start taking pix right out of the box. The only thing I had to consult the manual for was how to set the time and date. Other than that, at least on the AUTO setting, it's just point and shoot. And the pix upload beautifully into my Mac PowerBook's iPhoto library. The best part, in my opinion, about using this camera with a Mac? I didn't even have to load the multiple software packages that came with the Canon camera. iPhoto handles most everything, and what it doesn't I can do in Photoshop. This is a great camera, which I think has been replaced by the A630. But I don't care! I got a great deal and love the A620. The only caveat? Buy yourself a good set of rechargeable NiMH batteries and a quality charger, like I did. Using regular AA batteries may end up costing a lot in the long run. I'd recommend the Canon A620 to anyone looking for a mid-range, quality digital camera. Look around for bargain prices on the web, though.

I bought the A620 about 8 months ago because I wanted something small but good to go along with my much larger new Nikon D50.  Both cameras were replacing an old 3 MP Fujifilm and a Minolta film SLR.  We took the A620 and the D50 on a major trip to the Canadian Rockies and several U.S. national parks.  The D50 was my \"default\" camera on the trip--frankly, I was afraid to \"risk\" the shots on the A620, especially since there were many times when I needed a wider-angle lens than the A620 provides.  Then, one afternoon, at the top of a mountain in Jasper with a spectacular panoramic view, the D50's battery ran down.  I was crestfallen, forced to use the A620.  For the rest of the afternoon, I worried and fretted about how one of the major highlights of our trip wouldn't be captured as well by the A620.  Well, to make a long story short, several weeks later I uploaded all our photos from the D50 and A620, and the ones from the A620 at the top of that mountain were better!  I was amazed--nicer color, sharper, just plain better!  Now I totally trust the A620 and actually use it far more than the D50 because it's a lot easier to take along.  I still prefer the D50 for indoor flash shots--there's a lot of red-eye with the A620--but I have to say, if I'd bought the A620 before the D50 and given it a good test run, I don't think I would have bought the D50, even though I really like it.  Sometimes portability is much more important than you think it's going to be.  I got the A620 brand new for under $200--it was a great deal and is a great camera.  I think it's especially good for people like me who aren't likely to delve into all the intricacies of settings, etc., but still take a lot of photos and want them to look great.

Then, to further the deal, i ended up getting the pricey underwater casing that complements this camera. In a few simple words, amazing. This camera has shattered all of my expectations and then some. I face little to no problem with red eye upon taking hundreds of pictures. I went to the Milwaukee Domes and Botanical gardens and managed to obtain professional grade photo close ups on hundreds of flowers and pictures. With a 1gb sd card (only about thirty bucks outside a kit) you can take about 800 pictures on the highest resolution or about 8 minutes of video. The video is top notch, providing high quality sound and video that is good enough for putting on the television screen. This means if you feel like investing in say a 4 gb sd card, you can have upwards of 24 minutes of video, which is a pretty much all you would need for video recording (you'd be surprises how long 24 minutes is when you are playing it back on your computer)The battery life is amazing. Upon taking it to the gardens, the domes, Noah's Ark (to test underwater), a nearby park, a few other test runs one takes when they get a new toy, i finally managed to wear out the batteries that came with it. After that, I started using rechargeable batteries that came with my kit. I charged them once about three months ago, and I am still using the camera on there first charge after two months of camera use.The LCD screen seems a bit fragile, seeing as it is not completely attached to the camera from all sides (for its swivel feature). I have really only had a use for the swivel feature once with all my shooting, but it is nice to have and I wouldn't have it any other way.The one or two disadvantages is no internal memory, so if you forget to put an sd card in the camera, it doesn't function at all. Also, it isn't a small camera. Which means investing in a good case is a smart idea, especially if you got all the accessories and want to use most of them. (The one that came with the kit is lacking)With respect to the attachments one may think about getting with this camera, the filters are nice. there is a uv filter, pl filter, and another filter. The HD and wide angle lenses are lacking in practical use for the computer. They don't seem to help very much unless your intent on getting a full landscape picture that doesn't already turn out nice without. The other problem is that the flash produces a very pronounce shadow over the corner, meaning you have to turn the flash off if you are ever using any of the filters or lenses. (in other words, they can only be used in well lit areas). The stand that came with the kit is just some small short thing with bendy legs, not really useful for portraits, but pretty useful for trips if you want something to take a steady shot or if you want to be in your shot. The underwater camera case is nice, and unlike the filters and lenses, it comes with a flash blocker that keeps the flash from casting a shadow (unfortunately you can't use this for the filters and stuff). The casing is pricey, but if you consider they fact you can take very high quality underwater picts without having to buy expensive disposables and movies too, its worth it.Back to the actual camera, it has a large degree of modes, functions and speeds. For less experienced people, you can use the 5 some modes for auto set features. These include an in camera stitching functions for extreme wide angle views. What is does it takes a picture, then places the edge of the picture next to the screen of the current camera  view. This allows you to line up your shot and not make any mistakes with the stitch while taking the adjacent pictures. For those who don't know what a stitch is, a stitch is taking two picture side by side, then using a program to match them together, thus giving one continual shot. For more advanced users, you can manipulate hundreds of functions from how rapidly it takes photos to how long it get the image of the photo. You can also manipulate lighting, flashes, resolution, and a 100 other things in another five settings that range in what they specifically target (one mode concentrates on shutter speed, another concentrates on something else. You can also take sepia, black and white, and even underwater picture settings(a setting designed to decrease the blueness of water while using the casing). Also, the close up feature is very good, which allows the picture to adjust with every picture distance to give the optimum clear picture for close ups. (I use this extensively).Long story short (although it already is pretty long), this camera is definitely a great camera that anyone could find a great deal of uses for. I use it for everything and it has never given me any trouble. I have had it for four months and have not once come up with any major complaint. It still works fine and does not give me any problems. I come up with some of the most professional looking pictures one could expect in a high quality photo journal and its a camera that is not very expensive for what you get.", "Date": "November 4, 2006"}, {"Title": "Great combination of features and price", "Author": "I.

I was pleased with my decision, finding I enjoyed the luxury of internal light metering, auto focus, and built-in shooting modes, in addition to being able to set everything myself in Manual mode. So I decided to look into digital cameras. I chose to stick with the Canon brand and, as a Digital rebel is several thousand dollars out of my range, I settled on the PowerShot A620. I thouroughly enjoy being able to set aperture priority and allow pictures without a flash (but a very steady hand instead). In addition to taking gorgeous high-resolution pictures, it's good to know that I can buy a teleconverter lens, a macro lens, and even an underwater case for the camera, allowing me to upgrade without buying a new camera. Also, I enjoy some of the bells and whistles featured on this camera, particularly the features in the My Colors mode, which let me swap two colors, or choose an accent color in an otherwise black and white photo. While this won't replace my two manual cameras, just as my Rebel won't replace my Mamiya/Sekor, I am completely satisfied and would recommend it highly to anyone looking for a high-quality digital camera that's easy to use whether you're a novice or professional.", "Date": "July 17, 2006"}, {"Title": "Great Camera", "Author": "Maria Weiser", "ReviewID": "R1L90AFZT3M7B8", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "This is a terrific camera for a modest price, easy to use even for a beginner like myself.

The advantages of this camera include the fact that the user can set it to operate in an automatic mode (in which the camera makes all the focusing, shutter speed, f-stop, etc. adjustments for you) or in a variety of semi-manual or fully manual modes.  This allows the novice user to enjoy the camera right out of the box, but keeps the more experienced user from getting bored with plain ol' snapshots.Also advantageous are the swivel lcd screen and the optical viewfinder.  The swivel screen lets the user view the potential picture at all sorts of angles.  This, I have found, is particularly useful when trying to take a timed picture of a group.  People can stand in the group and generally check the swiveled-around screen (at least when indoors) to see that everyone will be in the picture.  The optical viewfinder helps when taking several pictures in rapid sequence - trying to follow the action in the lcd screen is, I think, more difficult.The shutter lag time (the time between when you push the shutter button and when the camera takes a picture) for this camera is fairly short.  There are faster cameras out there, but when you've already focused this camera on the subject first by pushing the shutter button down halfway, the shutter time when you then fully press the shutter button is less than half a second.The movie modes work well, and in the finest resolution mode they are pretty sharp.As far as regular photographs go, the camera takes incredibly sharp pictures.  I have found that the pictures are actually better than those taken by my old Pentax K-1000 SLR.The downside to the camera is probably its weight and bulk.  It is smaller than an SLR for certain, but bigger than a lot of other digital cameras out there.  Unlike most other digital cameras, it uses four AA bateries instead of only two.  The batteries last a long time, but the camera does not have any battery power gauge.  It does give you a warning when the batteries are low, but when that happened to me it ran out of power very shortly afterwards.  I recommend travelling with spare batteries.Overall, for the general user, I highly recommend this camera because of its sharp pictures and great versatility.", "Date": "August 13, 2006"}, {"Title": "Excellent", "Author": "cameraGuy2007", "ReviewID": "R1HR8DXLRZQ2ZC", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "This is an excellent camera.  It was my first camera, and I loved its feel, features, and functionality.I do have to admit, this little thing was what got me motivated to get into photography as a hobby, so after a half-year, I jumped up to the more expensive but higher-quality DSLR range.  For those who want to take photography seriously, this is the perfect camera to start off on.  Or, for those who want a simple point-and-shooter that packs a lot of punch, this camera succeeds there as well.Some other thoughts: - Battery life was stellar, even on cheap alkalines - Zoom was very decent (4X), but don't use the digital zoom - My Colors modes were nice, but remember that they're permanant  (a picture taken in black and white will always be black and white) - Tripod mount was plastic, but for the little tripod work I've done,  I didn't seem to mind or notice. - The lens motor isn't very loud, which is a good thing. - The little \"beeps\" and shutter sounds can be customized or muted. - Don't buy accessories for this, they're not worth the extra $.  If you ever outgrow the camera, save up and look into getting  a fancy, sub-$1000 camera instead of trying to add on to this.  This camera does a great job at what it tries to do, but fails somewhat  with the add-on lenses (that require a hood and distort quality),  filters, etc.Overall, I highly recommend to all (there's a newer version out, I think.. A640 or A710; I'm not sure which is more comparable to this, as I'm not sure what the feature changes in the A700 line are.).  However, if you're taking photography more seriously and have some experience, then by all means save up and go with a DSLR instead (or buy this as a back-up camera).", "Date": "January 18, 2007"}, {"Title": "Excellent Camera, Beautiful Photos", "Author": "L.

This is because I found that the camera had a few weaknesses, but once you figure out how to control it, you can get past those pretty easily.First, this camera does not have an electronic viewfinder.  This will only affect you if you like to look through the viewfinder when taking photos instead of at the LCD.  If you do, then the pictures will be slightly off center, as the viewfinder is set above the lens and the difference between the views from the two is not corrected electronically.  At least I think  that's the problem.  I just know they're off center.Secondly, I found that shots taken on Auto came out overexposed--too much light.  I've taken to using the Manual setting for virtually every photo I take.  By doing that, you can control things like the shutter speed and get shots that are better exposed.  It's kind of a pain, especially if you don't want to deal with the technical aspects of photography, but I'm ok with it because it's forced me to be a better photographer in some ways.Really, most of the problems mentioned in the reviews I've read can be fixed by using the manual controls.  You can control the amount of flash emitted from the camera and you can set the shutter speed and ISO to make low light shots a little easier.  Also, if you set the camera on something steady and do the two second delay (self-timer function), press the button, and don't touch the camera, it will come out very clear.  If you have nowhere to set the camera, I've found success by taking continuous shots.  Put it on the continuous mode or whatever it's called, and hold the button down, and it will snap for ages.  Then scroll through and pick the least blurry shot out of all of them.  It worked quite well for me.Some good things...  It's very good with macro shots and really picks up color quite well.  You can boost the color by using the vivid color setting.  Kind of nice for some shots.  And the flip screen is true genius.  Great for aiming those self-portraits, shots from above, and even balancing the camera somewhere if you get desperate. :)  I'm also very happy with the way the pictures look when they're printed out.  The mega-pixel amount is more than good enough for any amateur use.All in all, I've been happy with this camera.  It takes some getting used to, but if you're willing to work with it, it produces quality results.  As you might have gathered though, it may not be the camera for the person who doesn't want to deal with manual settings and the like.

It always moans at me about taking a potentially unsteady shot when the light is low, and I don't remember the A80 ever being that fussy. But I think it is down to cramming 7 MP into the same sensor size as the 4 MP of the A80, so each pixel becomes smaller, and therefore less sensitive to light.I have taken some really great photos with this camera, and would only replace it by moving up to a digital SLR, however I would still use it as an everyday carry around camera.It's metal frame construction makes it quite robust too.

I get a ton of detail and can pick out what I want, even if it's really far away. I took some pictures of tigers at the zoo and I could zoom in so much I could see their fur. It was awesome.Automatic settings: If, like me at first, you dont' know how to use all those crazy manual settings, there's a ton of other settings to pick from that you can use for pretty much anything.

I have to go to manual settings, and if the lighting is crappy, don't even try it. The shorter you make the shutter speed, the less light gets in.Focus: because it's digital, you can't focus on your own, and the camera just picks something it thinks is most important.

That goes double in sunlit conditions.I hadn't replaced my digital camera for years, and being able to interchange lenses on a sub-$400 camera is mindblowing to me...way to go, Canon!The fact that it takes 4 standard \"AA\" batteries is a double-edged sword, with generic rechargeables and cheap alkalines readily available, as well as unbelievable battery life. Almost two months and I haven't changed them yet. Still, it makes it a bit less travel worthy from bulk, as does the protruding power lens which is always a danger of extending in my ever packed briefcase where I'm forced to carry it on business. Still, the flush set power button is well designed to help eliminate that problem.I'd say my only serious beef with this otherwise fine piece of equipment is the fact that a few features that should be quickly and intuitively available are not.

I have taken this on various journeys and carried in my front jacket pocket for the majority of the time with no effect to the camera.Never mind the technical specs. The pictures are spectacular.

Whether in the fields of Mexico or in the grit of Paris and London, this camera takes AMAZING 7.1 mp pictures every time.  An old set of 2300nmh AA batteries powers it for about 300 pictures.  In good lighting situations, the pictures are crisp and sharp.  The Auto setting is fantastic, but the manual settings are impressive.  I've had this camera for two years and it hasn't failed, despite being jostled in a cargo pants pocket and being pulled in and out of camera bags.

I have had it for about 3 years now, and, not considering minor wear, it is just as fantastic as the first day I bought it.  There are literally too many amazing features to mention.  I STILL find new, creative settings to use on my camera, and, believe me, I use my camera almost every day! One of my favorite features is the swivel screen.  It really is worth the extra money to have this on a digital camera.  I wouldn't ever get one that didn't have this feature. Not only can you be in the pictures much easier by swiveling the screen around, but, more importantly, it protects your screen from scratches and cracks.  Pretty much all digital cameras chew through batteries faster than the speed of light, and the A620 is no exception.  Therefore, I definitely recommend rechargeable batteries for the A620.  I use Energizer 2500 mAh rechargeables, and I have only switched back and forth between 4 packages (4 AA batteries come in a package) in 3 years.  They are about $10.00-12.00 for a pack of 4.

It's easy to use, has many features more expensive Canon's use, and has a fantastic zoom capability.Then, after about 3 weeks of use, the batteries included with the camera caused the case to burn, damaging the lid. Naturally, we were really concerned about this and called Canon. Even though the batteries were not made by Canon, they were extremely responsive and within a week they had another camera on the way.All we can say is not only is the camera an EXCELLENT buy, so too is the quality of service. The followups. The interaction. And the deep committment to our satisfaction is testiment to the way Canon does business.We're a customer for life.

When I bought this camera over a year ago, I got it for about 300...  I think there is an error because the newer model is selling for about half the price.In any event, I want to declare that this is the BEST camera I had ever owned.  I used this camera for more than one year, taking thousands and thousands of pictures.  I studied abroad in Argentina for the year and took pictures of absolutely everything.  This camera never failed me.  Never.  It took brillant, rich, great color pictures.  I was never interested in the video component, but it served my purposes the few times I used it.The BEST feature is the pop out LCD screen.  Not only does it let you take pictures up high or down low (like at a concert, looking out over everyone) but you can turn the screen around and take amazing self portraits.  Instead of asking strangers to take pictures of my friends and me, we'd just turn the screen around and I got some of my best pictures this way.  The zoom is good, the pic quality is five stars, the menu and settings are great. . . No complains whatsoever.I do want to talk about it's death so you that you are aware of it.  This camera has a huge lense and is quite heavy.  After about 14 months, the lens got stuck open.  I assume it's a mechanical failure in the mechanism that opens and closes the lens.  I've sent it in for service and await Canon's answer.  I deeply miss it and although at the end it malfunctioned, I've never had such a good camera.  I hope Canon will have good news for me.  I don't know if this has happened to anyone else, but I doubt it's the case.  My friend bought the newest model and it has even more cool feature, like zooming in and focusing on a single subject and then only applying color to it and leaving the background graytone.  Well, that's a review for another day.  If you want a very capable, but heavy camera, this one will not disspoint you.  But you should be able to find it between 200 and 300.", "Date": "September 21, 2007"}, {"Title": "Fantastic!", "Author": "Paul Hughes \"Nemrel\"", "ReviewID": "R2467NKPRI4HHO", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "Options - options - options!!! This camera gives you the options you need in a nice entry level digital camera. I have used it for portrait photography, during meteor showers (pictures just needed slightly edited in Photoshop), for paranormal investigations (yep ghost hunting is a hobby), for product shots for websites and much more. It has everything you can want in a camera. Although it might be a little old (I got mine about a year ago), but if I was going to buy somebody a camera or another one for myself I would definitely choose this camera or another Canon Powershot. In fact my mother-in-law loved the pictures so much she went out and bought herself one. And she loves it too.The only con is a slight problem it has when taking pictures of eyes. If you use the red eye reduction mode it isn't much of a problem, but without it you may get a lot of green and red hued eyes from your subjects. If you forget to set your red eye reduction mode on you may need to touch up your pictures in a photo editor.Other than that the camera is perfect! Batteries last long (I'd say over 300-400 pictures per set of batteries - which includes a lot of looking at the screen and reviewing the pictures), their are a ton of customizable settings, the movie mode takes gorgeous movies and the pets & kids mode sure helped me when taking pictures of my new kitten. It also has everything you need in order to plug it into your TV outs and play picture shows for family and friends. Which is great when you want to show grandma some of your pictures and she doesn't have a computer.The first major use the camera got was at the zoo and in the hands of my wife. She didn't bother to read the manual or practice. Without really kn owing what she was doing - the pictures turned out perfectly! The zoom was amazing!!! She got pictures of the animals that showed such detail as veins on the tongues of the giraffes. Dust cracks on the backs of the elephants and much more. Best part was that she was over 20 to 30 feet away from her subjects and out of harms way. Yet the pictures were so close and detailed!One tip - get a larger memory card - 1gb or more. As with ALL digital cameras you buy these days you will need higher storage than the card they give you. I mean at the highest quality setting on this camera (7mb) - you can only take about 15 pictures before the camera card they give you is full. Save yourself the frustration and just buy a larger memory card.For those of you interested in ghost hunting this camera is great! I'm happy to say that after extensive testing this camera doesn't show that many orbs created from dust.

The really awesome feature that most people seem to over look is the tilt/rotating screen on the back of the camera.  I would suggest that you should always buy a camera with this feature.  It makes taking so many pictures easy.  You can hold it over your head and see what you are taking,  on the ground without laying down, and a favorite of mine is the self portrait of my wife and I.  Just flip the screen and there you are, compose and shot.(helps to have long arms)  Being the third or forth generation of chip for Cannon I am impressed with the blacks in low light.  Older cameras the blacks seem to get real noisey.  I am not a huge fan of digital zooms but this one holds up ok, but it just can't be perfect.  And if you use the right batteries you really can get 300-400 pictures out of this guy.  I would suggest this camera over it counterparts up to the 10-12 megapixel area just for the control and the flip screen.  To my knowledge the megapixel differance doesn't come into play unless you triple the pixels and even in those cases with most people using just 4x6,5x7 and some 8x10s you not going to see it unless you have to do major cropping. I have also given two of these as gifts and everybody seems to be very impressed with the overall performance.  One problem I have with mine is the battery door.

Unlike some users, I had no trouble downloading pics from the camera using Canon's\"Camera Window\" software (for Windows and Macs).  But I have a Mac - perhaps there's some problem with the for-Windows version.After 4 months, I purchased a \"virtual twin\" A610 (6 megapixel instead of 7.1) for my daughter - her first digital camera.  We've both been very pleased at the quality of pictures and the ease of getting good photographic results.  I took very good care of my camera, I loved it so much!Cons: excellent battery life with NiMha rechargeables, 3072 x 2304 image size produces excellent poster sized prints (and down to wallet size).  Amazing macro focus - can produce pictures of honey bees which appear to be the size of chickens.Drawbacks were minor: only 4x zoom and the flash is a bit small (but causes little red eye and that easily corrected).  And - all digital point & shoot cameras seem too vulnerable to rain, a common condition in most climates.  Putting them in an expensive waterproof case reduces portability and hampers picture taking and functions like the microphone.  (Otherwise - videos have almost startling sound quality from the tiny, built-in design mic.)Until, that is, my A620 suddenly gave out a loud scream and displayed \"E18\" on the LCD viewscreen.  The lens barrel had jammed when I turned the camera on; this caused the drive motor to strip the gears which extend and retract the lens barrel.  This happened after 3,000 pics, a few dozen (very good) video clips and  7 months and 7 days of frequent (trouble free) use.  I had \"thought\" I'd heard some tell-tale gear noises before the breakdown, but the sound difference was slight and I thought I might be imagining it.Investigation on the web revealed this problem (known as the E18 error) has been around long enough that a class action suit has been filed against Canon because of it.  Right now, I've sent in my camera to Canon and I'm waiting to hear from them.  They have a very good \"support\" web page and responded within a few hours via email, giving detailed instructions for returning the camera and what to expect in terms of waiting period, etc.Would I buy another Canon PowerShot?  Yes - within hours of the breakdown, I had researched their PowerShot S3-1S, 6 megapixel and picked one up locally.  The S3 is a definite upgrade from the A620: 12 x zoom, great \"image stabilizer\" and much sturdier construction (along with another 8 oz weight).  I plan to continue using the A620 once its repaired because its handy to carry around (I use a belt-mounted carrying case).  But though I believe the A6*0 series is a lemon, Canon produces many fine models besides those.

Pictures are also easy to download at reasonably fast speeds.The available options allow you to customize almost everything, and they function logically once you understand the concepts (ISO, f stops, shutter speed, etc.)The included software isn't as fancy as photoshop, etc. but is adequate for a beginner.I like the fact it uses AA batteries (get some good rechargables while you're at it) so you can just buy new alkalines if you run out in a pinch. Battery life seems pretty good, but it'd be nice if it had a real battery meter. When you get the low battery signal it's almost too late.Some may think the camera is too bulky, but I don't find it too bad, especially considering all the features packed inside. I also have big hands and have a hard time w/ some camera's tiny buttons. It's about the same as a simple film camera for size & weight.The only complaint I have is the flimsy door for the AC/USB/RCA jacks panel. It doesn't like to stay closed on mine.All in all, I can't recommend this camera highly enough. Just wish I'd had it a long time ago.

Ellis", "ReviewID": "RM36OQNUELZC9", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "Up until I bought this product, I've never owned a camera before. After doing a lot of research online, I settled for this one. I bought it back in July, I think...so this would be a semi-longrun review. I am by no means an expert photographer, but even I can appreciate what this camera has to offer.Pros:-Control. This product has a lot of little buttons and switches. If you don't learn what they do, then they get in the way. If you do take the time to read the manual, you will be very happy with the results. The automatic controls work pretty well, and there are enough manual options to keep the expert photographers interested.-7.1 Megapixels. On the default settings, this camera takes pictures at 3072 x 2304 pixels. This is HUGE, and allows you to capture a lot of detail in your shots. Example: let's say you're zoomed all the way in on a distant object. You take the picture, and look at the LCD screen only to say to yourself \"Aww, this looks small.\" Upon getting home and uploading it to your computer, chances are the distant object will be HUGE on your computer screen. (Sorry for my lack of technical terms, I'm a novice photographer)-The LCD screen. Being able to swivel the screen around to face any direction gives you infinite possibilities for how you take shots. Example: You want to take a picture of yourself. Instead of doing that typical MySpace-onehanded-mirror-picture we see everywhere, you can point the camera at yourself, and line the shot up looking at the swiveled around LCD screen. You then put on a nice smile, and let the camera do a timed shot. Having a mini tripod helps this immensely. I bought a 6\" collapsible tripod from a local Big Lots for $4.-Battery life. This is one of this product's biggest selling points. It uses four AA batteries, and this can potentially give you a lot of battery life. I say potentially because it depends on the batteries you use. When I first got it, I used the alkalines that came with the camera. They lasted about a week. I then bought a set of rechargeable Ni-Cad batteries. Those lasted a MONTH. And I took a lot of pictures when I got the camera. I've only had it 4 months, and I have over 500 shots...about 1.7 gigs, including the video I've shot. That's a lot by my standards, at least.Cons:-Size/weight. When you read the dimensions, it sounds like a small camera. When you actually hold the thing, the right half of the camera is huge and bulky (due to the 4 AA batteries inside). So what this means is that you can buy a smaller camera, but it's probably not going to be 7.1 megapixels, and the battery life is not going to be as good. Unless you want to shell out the money for a top of the line Sony Cybershot, that is.  And yes, having 4 AA batteries makes this camera kind of heavy. Carrying it in your pockets might be uncomfortable.All in all, I'm very pleased with this camera. I've gotten a lot of good shots with it in these past four months, and I expect to get many more.  This is a good camera for any person, be they a beginner (like me) or a more experienced photographer. I cannot recommend this camera highly enough. I will say, however, that you should visit a local electronics store and handle this camera before you order it. If you're okay with the size and weight, then you'll be rewarded by a powerful camera with excellent battery life.", "Date": "November 5, 2006"}, {"Title": "great camera", "Author": "Mark Hubbard", "ReviewID": "R3LKLB8E8M0M1B", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "Very good camera.

Previously i've owned 2 SLR cameras with various lenses and flash attachments, as I am also NOT a fan of the small point and shoot cameras because I don't like their pictures either.  But THIS camera is AWESOME.  It takes beautiful pictures in all sorts of conditions on the AUTO setting.  It has some really cool features like being able to make the whole picture black and white except you can choose one color to be highlighted.  It is so much fun to experiment with.  I bought it for a beach and Disney World vacation and i'm thrilled with the results.  I took over 400 pictures just on the Disney trip alone!  I've had several people ask me if I have a really high end digital camera, based on the quality of the photos and they're always shocked when i tell them the price.  I feel like this is a STEAL! I've recommended it to others and 2 family members have already purchased it.  It is really a marvelous little camera.  The large amount of MP is not typical for this price range and the zoom is more than adequate (that's the one thing i REALLY miss about my SLR is the 300x zoom) but as far as digi cams go, this one has an impressive zoom.  I really researched reviews and consumer electronics websites before the purchase.  THis camera was highly rated across the board so i purchased it and i'm COMPLETELY satisfied.  It does take 4 AA batteries rather than the typical 2, but the Energizer lithium batteries have lasted me thru more than 400 pictures, constantly reviewing the pictures (because they turned out so great, i keep looking at them), using the large screen rather than the viewfinder and constantly zooming in and out and turning the camera on and off.

Also, the computer program the camera comes with helps to fix up the colors and brightness quite nicely.- The screen flips out so that you can use it in different ways.

H.", "ReviewID": "R14VGXVDXYVS0Q", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "In choosing a new digital camera I was looking for the following features: both automatic and manual settings, optical zoom, more than 5MP, optional lenses, AA batteries, and under $500. I found this all in the A620. I like simplicity and have not yet explored the advanced settings with manual controls, but I have taken advantage of the macro, beach, night and portrait settings a great deal, all with great results. The flip-out monitor is quite handy and the optical zoom visualized through the viewfinder for battery conservation. I have the optional macro lens attachment for close ups of foliage and animals and find it to be useful, but for the average user the regular macro setting is adequate. The only things I would change would be to make the dc/av door hard instead of flimsy plastic, and to include a better lens cover of some sort. When the lens is closed, two thin plastic \"doors\" fit together to cover the lens. Unfortunately I dropped the camera and the pieces did not go back together properly at first. Fortunately I was able to manipulate them back into place to fix it. I would advise an upgrade to a larger card as the included disk will not hold much at the higher settings - and purchasing a 7 mp camera indicates you would want to use them. I invested in a 1GB card, and it was well worth the money. I like the convenience of AA batteries as they are easy to obtain in a pinch. I bought 2500 mAH rechargeables and they lasted my entire vacation while taking over 350 photos and still have plenty of juice left.

My beef is with the abhorrent software that Canon provides. It takes me a dozen tries just to download images to my computer. I may be no Alfred Einstein (sic), but I am a computer professional. I've never dealt with software so completely unwilling to cooperate. It doesn't matter how great the photos are if you have to struggle to get Canon software to download images from your Canon camera.First, if Canon would see fit to make the A620 look like any USB memory stick, I'd just drag and drop the images to my hard drive. But it doesn't look like a memory stick, so you have to use Canon's software to move images to your PC.Second, the software repeatedly tells me that the camera is no longer available and to check my USB cable. Wrong! My cable is fine and the camera remains powered up. The software is simply crappy. I uninstalled the software, cleared everything \"Canon\" from my registry and reinstalled but to no avail.Third, when I tried to get support from Canon's web site, guess what? There is no support for the A620. So, I tried to contact Canon, and guess what? They are experiencing technical difficulties, so I can't even get an e-mail address or phone number from their web site.Customer service? I don't think so. This is absurd.

I figured a Canon camera, with 7.1MP and 4x optical zoom under $250- how could I go wrong.  When the camera came I was disappointed with the small size of the screen- only 2\" versus most of the competitors that are 2.5\" and yes it does make a big difference in how the picture looks.  Big deal the lens swivels around, and after a day or so you will get tired of that.  It does nothing to actually help the camera.  And also if you look at the lens from the side it is hazy and lacks color, which is a sign of a cheap screen.  Also notice this camera takes four large batteries whereas most of the competition takes only two.  These extra batteries make it almost impossible to fit this camera in your pocket and weigh the camera down.  Most importantly I was disappointed with the optics of the camera.  4x zoom should come in clearer than what this camera delivers.  Objects only 30 feet away will come in faintly and will lack crispness.  One should not have to buy overpriced, proprietary lenses to take a good picture.  A better bet would be the Fuji Finepix with 9MP which is more portable and has much better resolution.", "Date": "June 27, 2006"}, {"Title": "Canon Powershot A620 7.1mp Digital Camera", "Author": "William G.
