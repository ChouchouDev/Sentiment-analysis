{"Reviews": [{"Title": "Great Camera with a few small issues", "Author": "Howard \"Howie\"", "ReviewID": "R1AQBIWMQEPBHG", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "So I was in the market for a new camera and I wanted a tough camera because well cell phones these days who really needs a basic point and shoot camera and also I Scuba Dive and previously had a Canon Elph with a waterproof enclosure.  Every time I would take it in the water I had a moment where I crossed my fingers and hoped the case wouldn't leak.  With the recent 2013 model releases I narrowed it down to the Nikon AW110 and the Panasonic Lumix TS5.  I finally decided to go with the Lumix TS5 for 1 major reason.  Panasonic sells an external enclosure in case you plan on going deeper then 43 feet. (not on the market yet but I plan on getting one)I had read a lot of mix reviews on the TS4 about leaking which made me a bit nervous but I'm going to hope and assume they have rectified all the issues with the TS5.  I've had the camera about a week now.  I'm going to start off with a few negatives for me first (these are mostly pet peeves).Negatives:1.  What is the deal with the battery charger?  Why Panasonic didn't build the charger prongs into the charger is beyond me.  Now you need to carry around a charger plus a cable to plug into the charger and the wall.2. The manual states you can't keep the camera under water more then 60 minutes, that is not listed anywhere on their website would have been nice to know prior to purchasing.3. The manual states, if you drop the camera and then it leaks its not covered under warranty.  Um isn't the point of a tough camera so it can be dropped?  Why is that voiding the warranty?4.  My biggest complaint though is this proprietary connector they use to connect to your computer (hello micro usb standard Panasonic?), also the connector looks almost identical to the micro HDMI slot) so you gotta pay attention to make sure your putting it in the correct slot because their smaller connector cable sort of fits in the micro hdmi port. (made that mistake by accident already once)Positives:1.  The picture quality seems very good.  While I have only used the camera twice so far most of the pictures came out great.  I took the camera to a concert the other day, being very dark I was concerned how the pictures would show up. The camera has a feature called Hand Held Night Mode, and it basically took a bunch of shots in a row and I'm guessing merged them together so the final photo was actually good looking.  I had the camera on auto made and it automatically selected this.2.  The zoom is decent at 4.6X and adding the digital zoom up to 9.3X I had no issues getting a clear shot (even when it was dark).3.  The NFC is a nice feature as I own an Android phone and all you need to do is tap the phone and the camera together to pair them.  You have to install the Panasonic App, but you can do a bunch of things with it.  Remote control the camera, copy photos from the camera to the phone etc. (**disclaimer** occasionally I've had issues with the pairing on my HTC EVO LTE)4. The video recording and sound is great.  I record a 30 second clip while at the concert the other day and it was very clear and the picture looked great (from no zoom to fully zoomed).5. Had no problems catching moving objects and even with my shaky hands the pictures came out un-blurred.Miscellaneous:On a side note I needed to confirm some things with Panasonic the manual stated, Panasonic Tier 1 support is worthless, finally escalated to Tier 2 and they were a lot more helpful.1.  The camera has a rattling noise when it is off.  Panasonic's response was: This is normal.  The camera contains an Optical Image Stabilizer.  When turned on the optical image stabilizer is engaged and thereby compensates for hand shake or camera movement.  However, when it the camera is turned off the Optical Image Stabilizer is disengaged and allows movement of those components.  This is the rattling or clicking that you hear.2.  The manual says \"do not use for Scuba Diving\" I wanted to confirm if that meant at any depth or in general.  Their response was: Recreational Scuba diving goes to ~120 ft.  We included this statement due to the camera's depth limitation.3. The manual says \"Waterproof function of the camera is for sea water and fresh water only.\"  I wanted the make sure I could take the camera in the pool.  Their response was: You can use it in a pool, which is fresh water.  We included this statement as it cannot be used in hot tubs (due to high temp) or used as an inspection camera in hazardous situations such as polluted water, chemical spills and so on.I have not yet taken the camera in the water or dropped it or used it as a \"tough\" camera so I can't really comment on any of that, hopefully I can update this review as I use it over the course of the next few months.  But for now I will give it 5 stars as it hasn't shown me any reason to rate it lower just yet.", "Date": "April 5, 2013"}, {"Title": "great features-unusual set up", "Author": "R. Chadwick \"robchad67\"", "ReviewID": "R1ONBHSI9BT4CJ", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "First this is a great camera and a pretty reasonable price. The included features are fun and certainly creative.Going to just put some thoughts down- positive and negative 1. Very slippery grip and I would purchase a floating grip. My last underwater camera was an Optio WG-1. Very different shape and that camera was surrounded by a non-skd type grip. Thisonly has them on either side. ( but is is comfortable )2. The \"manual mode is almost manual. I assumed that i could adjust aperture and shutter at my discretion. This only has two apertures available F3.3 and F10. The shutter speed is from fractions of a second to 4\". I guess i was expecting DSLR manual. so milky waterfall scenes \"could\" get done- more playing with the exposure value- which can be done With Bracketing for you HDR fans ( still useful )3. For the time lapse you can adjust the intervals from 10/20/30/40/50/60 seconds ( nothing  else ) and then by the minute for up to 30 minutes with up to 1000 shots. ( unsure about this - to make nice cloudscapes you not only have to drag the shutter you have to keep a tighter interval then 10 second---but still fun! )4. During TIME LAPSE the max open shutter speed is 4 seconds, I guess i was going to try some backyard astrophotography like my d7000 and show the rotation of the circumpolar stars but 4 seconds is really not enough to get the fainter details. Generally i use high aperture 1.8 and 30 seconds for milky way type shots ( still interesting and while not art is it fun )5.Creative filters are fun and interesting. ( Beats trying to post edit them someplace when in-camera works great! )6. Very fast autofocus and the IQ is very good! scene modes are fun and HDR is very good. ( can i keep saying this is a fun camera ? )7. Starry skies scene mode -unlike above #4, is a long term open shutter 15 or 30 seconds-fixed. I can see this being useful for fireworks also. ( to cloudy to get a lot of use lately )8. Stupid double buttom \"menu/set\". To access you must double click. This is just a gripe coming from a dlsr. My Optio was similar. ( just need to get used to using it )9. NFC and wifi --well wifi works well but i cannot get app to work on iPhone--but works great on my daughters galaxy note. and no NFC for iPhone ( so just move along nothing to see folks )10. The most important---most important button is the lower right \"trash can/Q menu\". While shooting in any mode and any scene pressing this will pull up a nice graphic interface of what is available for you to use or adjust. This is the creative side that we use when in other than program mode! White balance-ISO-mp size-video settings-burst mode ( up to 60 fps!- reduces mp size )11. This has a dozen different video sizes and formats avchd and mp4 1080 i,p,g,- 720 same with 60 fps!! going to get twixtor and try some things plus a few old school web type 640x480 ( really ? )12. Zoom is quick and quiet but i wont use digital zoom on any camera as it only degrades the quality--BUT this has a nice intelligent zoom that seems ok so far.13. Lastly for now, this is a very nice camera and while it doesn't have everything i wanted- i can drop it and throw it in the river and it still take great pics. Macro with 1 led light was ok but not at good as my Optio, but the wireless fun, greature aperture and shutter speed with options make up for it. Amazon was great with upgraded shipping and the price was good. Compared many cameras and while the nikon was close ( 240 fps slo mo )the wider aperture and better than most controls were a good selling point fo me.

Then with the camera in the review,menu option you can create a time lapse video and select a group of time lapse photos. You can edit or remove each of the pictures prior to editing. Once a time lapse video is created you will have all of the still pictures as well as the newly created video. Very cool feature!I bought this camera after mine broke on my first day of vacation. I wanted a tough, waterproof camera and this TS-5 was the best that I found after comparing it to several other waterproof cameras. This TS-5 had a larger battery, which allowed 340 pictures on a charge and that is about 100 more then the closest similar camera. By the way I bought additional batteries (http://www.amazon.com/dp/B00CIVVT04/ref=pe_175190_21431760_3p_M3T1_ST1_dp_1) that allowed me to take 700 pictures on a charge.This camera has a time lapse option that s a great feature when used with a tripod. You have several options such as 10 second intervals up to 30 minutes to take pictures of the changing sky or a blooming flower etc. once you have set and taken time lapse photos the camera has an option to convert it to a movie at 6 frames per second or 30 fps to create a seamless movie from the still pictures.There is also a feature that will allow you, while reviewing video that you have already recorded, to save/convert any frame to a still picture. This will also keep the newly created still picture in perfect focus. I recorded a bird drinking and flying off and was able to create still pictures of it taking flight. This was a very cool effect and is simple to use.I would recommend a tripod to use some of these options. I bought a flexible tripod, which allowed me to wrap the legs in a small tree and use the remote control function to take video of a birds nest feeding new born chicks. I found myself keeping the camera with me all the time to try to get familiar with the functions and I had a lot of fun doing it.This camera was the only one that has built in WIFI. The remote control function uses this feature. The camera generates its own wifi signal and you just have to connect your tablet, I-Pad, I-Phone or other smart phone to that SSID wifi network,  did use a I-Pad and an I-Phone 4s and each worked fine. You do have to download the free Panasonic app to use this feature. With the remote control function you can take video, still pic's and zoom. You can also review still pictures only with this, not video, as well as drag and drop them to save them on your smart phone or tablet. You can setup a link to apps like Facebook and send them right from the camera if you setup a Lumix Club account (free)  and it will create a Lumix folder for uploads to Facebook and other apps.Once you have connected to your own wifi setting you can go to the wifi history and rename that setting and save it as a favorite connection, this will remember your network SSID and password and connect quickly without having to re-enter your password, which can be a pain if you do this a lot. With the wifi you can automatically save pictures to your connected device as you take each picture. You can also use this to send pics to your pc without having to connect your camera or remove the mem card. However this did not work with my IMac, nor does the software that comes with the camera work on a Mac. This was not an issue for me as I did open the camera and put the mem card into the Mac and copied all pics that way.The GPS, Altimeter,depth gauge and compass features are also very cool, but I have not used all of them yet. The camera can use the GPS to tag your city and your pictures. I have not been on a vacation to take advantage of this, but I am looking forward to trying it out in a remote setting.This camera has a bunch of preset settings for different situations such as night time shots, pictures through glass, far off scenery etc. it also has an automatic setting that will automatically change according to each situation to take a great pictures. The camera powers up very fast, about 3 seconds so you can shut it off to save the battery and turn it on quickly to take fast shots. You can use burst shooting to take several frames with one push of the shutter button to make the best picture out of the many frames used. This camera focus quickly as well.I haven't even used this under water yet and I absolutely love this camera. Is has these great features plus it is a waterproof (up to 43 feet), shock proof (for a drop up to 6 feet), dust proof and freeze proof and a rugged tough camera.I would recommend extra batteries, a hard case, a tripod and a floating strap in case you drop it in the ocean. As some other reviewers stated you may want to use the heavy or thick part of the strap instead of the thin string to attach your strap to the camera.", "Date": "June 19, 2013"}, {"Title": "Before buying this read the customer experience with the TS4 mine follows", "Author": "Michael \"SnapDoc\"", "ReviewID": "R25Y152Z5RF2R6", "Overall": "1.0", "Content": "Let me start by saying that I am a photographer. I buy cameras all the time. I buy them for myself my family and recommend them for my friends. I love to do the research and usually enjoy the results. This camera came highly recommended by reliable sources(DPreview etc) and I purchased it 15 months ago. I bought this camera to serve a specific role as the go anywhere, not worry about camera that I could give to my six-year-old. It was for vacation swimming and snorkeling as well as winter skiing when it was extremely cold and other cameras wouldn't work. It served those purposes well during its first year. It gave decent pictures. It's GPS function was reliable. It was problem free and gave good underwater pictures as well. I followed the recommendations about maintenance for the camera's battery and memory card door (yes I read directions). I have a Nikonos film underwater camera. Yes I am old, but I understand the care and maintenance that's required for cameras that you take underwater.Last week while vacationing in Hawaii, snorkeling in shallow water we encountered a pod of dolphins. They were playfully all around us. A fantastic photo op. It was at that moment that my Lumix failed. The screen became multicolored lines without a discernible image and I could not capture an image. The day was partially saved by my wife's Canon S 95. She was able to capture some of the action from topsides.I researched this online and found that many owners had this problem and that Panasonic had recommended that after year you buy an expensive kit from them to recondition the door seal or send the camera to them and for a very significant fee they would do that repair/Maintenance.This is not mentioned in their owners manual nor did I receive an email or written product advisory. Now I have an expensive bronze colored paperweight. Based on the reviews Panasonic has not done anything for all of those customers whose cameras failed in this fashion.So sorry Panasonic but I will not be buying any more of your products. This is not how you treat customers. You are not Apple we have lots of other choices for the products that you make.", "Date": "August 29, 2013"}, {"Title": "Horrible Customer Service, Mediocre Camera", "Author": "Matt S.", "ReviewID": "R35S8RZPPFN50C", "Overall": "1.0", "Content": "To make this easier for all reader formats, I will put the quick version at the top and argue the matter below it:Cons: 1)I have owned two Panasonic cameras that were supposed to be rugged and waterproof, and neither were.  Both failed in less than 1 year, both with less than 3 exposures to water.2) Their customer service is horrible.  I have spent many calls trying to work with them to fix my cameras, and they have some of the worst customer service I have had in years, maybe even my whole life.3) Expensive to maintain the waterproofing.4) Bad warrantyPros: 1) Pictures are fine.  You could get better image quality (pictures and video) with a less expensive camera though.2) My wife likes the outside color :)Further details: I consider myself an amateur photographer.  I usually shoot landscape photography and portraiture.  I ski, snowboard, snorkel and SCUBA dive (not all at the same time).  So it just makes sense to buy a camera that is compact and waterproof for some of these activities.  Years ago, you would buy a camera and waterproof housing.  The O-rings would eventually fail on the housings, especially if they were not cleaned and lubricated.  Most large camera makers now offer an \"all-in-one\" option.  I knew of a few friends who had the Panasonic Lumix and based on their testimonial and some online research, decided to buy into this product line.For the same purchase price, it is a fact that you can buy another camera that is not made to be \"weatherproof\" that provides better photo and video quality.  This matters if you do not use the camera by water or around harsh conditions.  If you only use it during nice weather and on land, stop reading and buy something else!!!  If you read Digital Photo magazine, August 2013, it lists its top 5 underwater cameras.  Panasonic does not make the list.  Not in the top 5!!  Canon, Fujifilm, Nikon, Olympus, Pentax.  No Panasonic.  Tells me Panasonic is doing something wrong.By personal experience, the one I bought was taken on a few snorkeling trips.  With the 3rd exposure to water, in less than 5 feet of water, its water seals failed.  The camera never turned back on.  My wife was upset that she couldn't take pictures the rest of the trip.  We had to send the camera back to Panasonic for repair.  In their warranty contract, they can repair the camera with refurbished parts, or just send you back a refurbished camera.  Whatever they decide, you have no choice.  So, they sent us back a refurbished one.We went on our next vacation 6 months later.  1st time this camera was put in the water it failed.  Let me repeat that, 1st time.  In under 20 feet of water.  It is rated to be waterproof much lower than that.  Called customer service multiple times.  Come to find out they only warranty their replacements for 3 months.  It doesn't provoke consumer confidence when a product that should be \"good as new\" is only warrantied for 3 months.  Because ours is outside of that, they want me to agree to ship it to them and pay for whatever they find is wrong.  No joke, I talked to a supervisor at customer service, she said, \"we will send you a shipping label if you agree to repair your camera for a charge.\"  I said, \"What is the charge?\"  Her reply, \"We will have to inspect it 1st.  You have to agree to pay the charge, whatever it is when we determine it, before we will send you a shipping label.  Do you want me to send the shipping label?\"  After three calls and two hours on the phone, that is the best customer service they had to offer.  The first time I called, I spoke with a very reasonable guy, however, the statements and promises he made were later cancelled by another supervisor, and they never called to tell me.Lastly, as you will read in other reviews, it costs a lot to maintain the cameras waterproof rating.  If you are lucky enough to have your camera last 1 year, you have to shell out the cash to have the seals replaced.  You would be foolish to do it yourself, but you can try.Overall, If you have read this far, please just buy another camera.  How many reviews have I written in the past 5 years.... 2.  Why two?  Because I don't want people to have the same experience with a substandard product.  You work hard for your money.  Spend it on something that has a better track record.

This camera, despite the advance in time, is not  only not a better camera but has regressed in several key areas.The three redeeming features of this camera:1.) the new coating on the lens is simply awesome; the old one was good but this one seems to shed almost everything!2.) when it decides to take a good, sharp picture, it takes a great sharp picture with excellent color rendition.3.) it really is waterproof.The rest of the reality:The battery life is execrable. Unless you're going to charge it every single day, you have to turn off GPS and the other features that distinguish this from the TS2. Even then, it's a hundred or so shots before recharging rather than 300-400 for the TS2. But of course the charger from the TS2 doesn't fit so you can't even leave your old charger in the car.The continued use of special-connectors is inexcusable, and fact that it's different special connectors than the TS2 is even more inexcusable.The UI went from good to atrocious. For example, you can't actually turn off the digital zoom; turning it \"off\" simply means that it pauses at the end of the optical zoom before digitally zooming. So you have to look at the UI rather than just holding down the zoom button. Sigh.The picture quality runs the gamut from incredibly impressive to the appalling, and alas many of the ones you really want to come out are on the appalling end of the scale. For me I think the primary issue is the image stabilization: the exposure is decent, the focus is best at the image point, but the image itself is so soft as to look like an old-school print enlargement.I'd put up with all of this if the average image quality was as good or better as the TS2. But really, the percentage of pictures that come out great is significantly lower than with the TS2.Finally, for those concerned about internal condensation: it does happen. Burying it in rice is one approach, but I find leaving it open in the freezer for a few days works great and doesn't have the risk of rice dust.", "Date": "September 19, 2013"}, {"Title": "Unacceptable noise in video", "Author": "Aaron Cohen", "ReviewID": "R110CDOUZZRKLT", "Overall": "1.0", "Content": "I purchased this camera due in large part to the issues with noise when recording video I keep reading about with the Olympus TG-2.

This is present both when playing back on my camera as well as on my television.  There are steady repeating grinding noises when taking a video in my room by myself with no ambient noise...Pictures look fine but the video is a dealbreaker.

You'll search the web, make the comparisons and hopefully NOT choose the least expensive . . . or most expensive. Still a LOT of choices and its hard to decide. You need to narrow them down. As an avid Nikon digital photog, I understand most of the important features one looks for in a camera, but still had to narrow down the tough waterproof PAS choices somehow.The Nikon looked a little too delicate, but its not. The Canon D20 is a great camera, but I'm not a Canon fan. I wanted full 1080p HD video @ 60 fps. I wanted the best lens system possible. Super fast lens (low aperture) in low light isn't as important as it used to be wit the new technology, so I wanted about 5x zoom. Didn't care about the additional 5x DIGITAL zoom on the TS5, but honestly in \"intelligent\" zoom setting it works way beyond my expectations. This Lumix TS5 has a Leica lens system. Pixel resolution is so high on most all of them, its enough for anyone @ 12 megapixels. The Lumix TS5 has 16.1. Like I said, that's higher resolution than you'll ever need. Good anti shake technology is important with these small tough cameras you take out into the field. I am amazed at what you can keep sharp handheld with this camera.All things equal. Narrow down the choices to 3 or 4. Make sure your most important features are included, and then get the one with the most NEW features on top of those. The one's your not sure about, because chances are they are worthwhile. Read the reviews and then go back to your comparison pages and bring up all the features side by side. You'll be amazed at some of the new features such as true HDR, and low light capability via multiple automatic exposures blended together seamlessly and staying sharp.Pro's: 1) The low light capability is amazing 2) the anti-shake system exceeds my expectations 3) The Panorama mode is terrific. Naturally on the camera screen its simply a long narrow shot very hard to see. What is great it has a \"play\" feature and places back the panorama shot like a video. Very cool. Maybe all of then do so - not sure. 4) the video quality in FULL 1080p HD video is also amazing. This is a little PAS camera that can do this? HD video in AVCHD or choose MP4. Vid quality is much better in AVCHD, but unless you have a Mac running OSX Mavericks, your system likely will choke on AVCHD if you want to transfer and play the video's on a PC. My iMac & Macbook can play AVCHD with a few mac tricks, or VLC will handle them for you. 5) Full GPS. Not for navigation, but for geotagging your photos & video's if you wanna. You can turn it on and off at will to conserve battery power. 6) Too many positives to go any further. You'll like the camera. I didn't really care much, but it also comes in black, gray, orange & blue.Con's: 1) Lack of availability of optional accessories. Try to find an OEM Micro HDMI to standard HDMI so you can play back direct from camera to your HDTV. They can't be found. I bought a $7 including shipping micro HDMI to HDMI cable that does the trick & works exactly as it should. 2) The \"manual\" settings are very limited, but how much are you actually going to need that with a PAS that has so many awesome automatic features? 3) The WiFi is a little tricky to get setup, and doesn't really work as I expected, but it does work. It's easier, and faster, to simply remove the SDHC card and transfer the files that way. 4) It comes with a smallish charger, but with a BIG AC cable that plugs into the side. I'd like to see a fold out plug type to keep the size down in your backpack and do away with the big AC cable. 5) I'm sure I'll get used to the lens it the upper left, rather than the middle of the case, but I've adjusted my grip.Last - DON'T FORGET to buy as big and fast SDHC card as possible and an extra battery. I was able to find a 64 GB Sony SDXC Class 10 card (40 MB/s) for $35 & a 2 pack of batteries with an extra small charger from Big Mike's for another $26.All in all, once you do your homework you will be very happy with any of the top 5 tough waterproof PAS's. I'm pretty sure if you choose the Lumix TS5 you will be tickled pink. I'd give it 5 stars if the accessories were available, and the WiFi worked as expected.

Sure will be nice not to have to worry about saltwater, sand, rain, banging it around a bit during these trips.Initial impressions, VERY nice quality pictures. Rich colors and contrast, even in lower light conditions. It appears to be a bit better quality than my DMC-ZS19, and more like the quality I had been used to on the CCD DMC-TZ5. I plan on stacking them all up and taking comparison shots. The video is super nice and I have not noticed the \"noise\" some have mentioned during recording. Again, plan on doing serious comparisons between all 3 cameras.Not taking any stars away for the 4.6x zoom (it IS what it IS) vs 10x+. I have read reviews where people complain it ONLY has the 4.6x zoom, YOU KNEW THAT WHEN YOU BOUGHT IT, DON'T COMPLAIN ABOUT IT! That's about 3/3rd's dumb!

I've never been into DLSR's as I like to travel light on my adventures and a point-and-shoot works better for that.  Recently the GoPro Hero3 has been getting a lot of buzz and it got me thinking about getting a newer camera with better video and camera resolution.  I have several outdoor adventures planned for this summer and so I wanted to upgrade before the season so that I could capture all the memories in higher resolution.  I did a lot of research into the GoPro Hero3 and studied its amazon ratings and reviews carefully.  The mixed reviews and troubles with the hero3 firmware led me to another possibility.  A ruggedized, waterproof point-and-shoot.There were several features of the GoPro that I really liked: - Waterproof, weatherproof - Remote control via Smartphone app - Video quality - Ability to mount in a variety of waysI began to research the leading ruggedized camera offerings and found the Lumix TS5 which has barely been released.  As of this review, there were only 2 reviews for it on Amazon and only a few CES 2013 videos on YouTube.  I searched Twitter and found more info and actual field video footage from Europe where it looks like a few guys got their hands on the camera early.  I took a chance and ordered the camera and received it last Thursday (4/11).The Lumix TS5 came with the features I really wanted, particularly the Smartphone remote control capability and GPS tagging.  The reason I wanted the remote control is so that I can mount the camera to my bike helmet and be able to start/stop the video recording without having to remove my helmet first.  I also wanted a good upgrade in video quality from my current Canon.  The GPS tagging is a bonus and I used to do that manually by keeping my camera clock in sync with GPS time and then later correlating the timestamps to determine position when the photo was taken.  Now I don't have to worry about it.So far my impressions of using the Lumix TS5 for a few days is favorable.  I was a little worried about the menu interface going from Canon to Panasonic, but I have found the menu system to be very easy to navigate and haven't had an frustrations.  I was able to set all the major functions up without having to refer to the manual.I am using the Panasonic Image App with my AT&T; Samsung Galaxy S3 and it works well with the camera.  I have tested the remote control functions and haven't had any issues with connecting the phone to the camera via WiFi.The GPS tagging works well and the GPS receiver seems to quickly acquire and maintain signal.  After I imported my first test images to Picasa, I was pleased to see that Picasa automatically brought up the Google map view of the photo location.  The Panorama feature will also come in handy as I usually create panorama images manually using Microsoft ICE.I can't yet talk about the battery life as I haven't had the camera long enough to really field test it on a weekend adventure (ATV, hiking, etc).  My guess is that the GPS and WiFi will really eat up the battery life and I am already anticipating the need for more than one battery on an excursion.  I have been looking closely at the Wasasbi batteries and am waiting for them to come out with a model compatible with the TS5.  Again, the TS5 has barely been released and so there isn't a lot out there yet.I bought the Professional Mini-Ball Head Camera Mount ([...]) and bolted it to my bike helmet.  I then mounted the TS5 to the helmet and used the smartphone app to remote control the camera.  My intention is to be able to capture footage of mountain biking in Moab this summer.

I took it with me on a dive trip to Bonaire.The intelligent features of this camera made it very useful above and below the water.  In the automatic mode in would detect back-lighting and take multiple exposures to integrate for the optimal exposure of foreground and background features.  The auto-focus was a bit fussy in low-light conditions with an in-experienced operator.  If time isn't allowed for the camera to properly sense some low-light pictures at dinner were out of focus.The battery held up well.  I purchased a back-up with a plug-in wall charger that worked well from Big Mike on amazon.I used it for shallow dives (typically second dive of the day).  Keeping my depth to less than 35 feet, I put the camera into advanced underwater mode and set the flash to always on and got some really amazing pictures.  It really captured the vivid colors of fish, corals, and my dive buddy.  The water clarity in Bonaire contributed to easily getting great pictures.  On one night dive when the water was very turbid only my macro shots looked good.  I could typically get into small areas that those with larger cameras could not and take some \"blind\" shots to try and get some fish hiding in the coral.  At the macro level I could get shots to within 8-12 inches that would remain in focus.  One curious fish came within 6 inches of the lens and I could not keep him in focus.  The best part was that I could put the camera on a retractable cord attached to my BC and just let it fall if I needed to use my hands.  I typically kept it in my BC pocket when entering and exiting the water.  I did have to be cautious to make sure the retractable cord did not become entangled with my Reg/Octo.  On deck I stored it in a waterproof otter box 3000 to protect it from heavy gear.It seems to feature some good stop action as well.  I was able to use it while skiing to capture great images of the kids taking some jumps under good lighting conditions.The wifi was a little difficult to figure out at first. But, I was able to directly transfer my images to my iPad after getting it set up.  First, I downloaded the Panasonic Image App for my iPad. When you turn on the wifi for the camera there is an option for direct connect.  I used this and then in my iPad settings I connected to the wifi sent from the camera and entered the passcode.  The camera then detected the direct connection with the iPad and instructed to open the Panasonic Image app.  Opening the app allowed initially does not appear to connect to the camera if one is looking at the iPad.  But, on the camera I was able to manually select multiple images (a bit tedious) and then send them to the iPad. While the iPad seemed to be still searching, the camera began uploading the images which wen t very quickly.  Once the images were uploaded the iPad prompted to view the images.

It replaced my prior Panasonic Waterproof camera that was stolen on vacation.  That camera was great, and this is even better.Let's start off with the main issues.  I'm so tired of people that pay for these small point-and-shoot cameras and then complain about picture quality.  This camera takes very solid pictures. Is it a professional camera? Of course not.  If you want that - then spend your huge $$ for a large camera that won't fit in your pocket and won't go in a pool.Besides solid pictures, the camera has a lot of size/quality settings for photo and video, and has a fairly quick trigger.  The interface is easy to use, and you pop the SD card in the computer to transfer your pictures.  The battery has been fine.  There is built in Wi-Fi which is pretty cool for uploading pictures off the camera on the fly (for backup, e-mail, Facebook etc)..  I must admit this was a bit challenging to set up, but once it was set up, it has been fine.If I had any complaint, its a very minor one that should never deter anyone from buying this camera - the battery charging.  You have to remove the battery, and you have to use a charging unit that is a unit plus a cord.  Compared to prior Panasonic cameras, this is a step backwards.  Other cameras let you charge the battery right in the camera with the USB cable, and I've also seen the charger unit as a self-contained wall-plug-in type.  Not sure why this camera doesn't have either of those.  Again, really not a big deal, but figured I'd mention it.This is a great camera with great features for the price point.

Initial reaction is positive - easy set up and configuration, decent picture quality in both stills and video.** Update - picture quality is good and video mode on the beach worked well.  Easily cleaned up and didn't worry about taking it in the water. **Let me first state that this and the other waterproof cameras are not a DSLR cameras, so you should not expect great pictures that you could enlarge while maintaining quality.  So, if that is what you are used to, I suggest you try out some other point and shoot cameras before purchasing.  This is a rugged, take anywhere camera, so some things will have to give to protect the lens.1. Wi-Fi - Standard feature - easily transfer pictures and control device remotely through Image App on your smartphone.  In addition, allows for wi-fi updates of gps assist data. Your options are wifi direct (camera to phone) or wifi through access point.2. GPS Assist Data - lasts 30 days versus the TG-2's 14 days and can be updated through any wi-fi connection (i.e. public hotspots).  No need to use special software or connect to your computer like the TG-2 requires.3. Charger - Battery is charged outside of the camera unlike the TG-2 which may seem like a negative until you factor in the charge time while you are on vacation.  You will probably want to keep a second battery on hand and will need/want a separate charger unless you are not going to be using he camera during the charging process.  I can state on my last vacation, I had a battery charging while I used my other camera during the day.  You do not want to miss a snorkeling shot because you ran out of juice.  The TG-2 uses a special USB connector and if you want to charge outside of the camera, you need to purchase a special USB charger.4. Video - TS5 offers 1080p/60 for video so eliminates some of the choppiness. Yes, you do hear the focusing of the camera, but only in quiet locations.  If you are filming outside, it shouldn't be an issue.I think those are the major reasons/differences for right now and I will update more about the most important factor - picture quality after I use it a bit more.

I took a couple of months to really do my research...and it paid off.  This camera is amaaaaazing.  Took it to Belize for a vacation- used it for a full day snorkeling trip.  We were in and outta the water all day- the camera did NOT fail.  It was trustworthy, took awesome underwater pictures and was easy to use.  Just read the simple directions for underwater use and you can't go wrong.  Outside of the water, it was also fantastic!  Beautiful pictures of mayan ruins, sunrises, sunsets, beach scenes, wildlife...the list goes on.  We even got impressive night pictures of the moon reflecting on the water which is normally not easy to do!  Use the intelligent setting OR have some fun and choose for yourself.  Lots of neat options and you can also crop and use special features (black and white, etc) on the pictures too.Another important feature that worked like a charm: the wifi!!  I was psyched that this worked so well and we were on a remote island!  Once the camera linked to my phone on its' own wifi, I was able to download the pix RIGHT TO MY PHONE with NO problems.  It took about 1/2 an hour to figure out; I'm no techie.  However, if I could figure it out, using the insert, so can you.  You can't upload directly from camera to facebook and you can't send directly from camera to email...but being able to send directly to your phone with no wires is good enough for me.You cannot beat the price for this camera.  It LOOKS really nice too!  I got mine in the blue and I bought an orange wrist floatie to go with it...that's a must have if you're taking it in the water.  On our snorkeling trip others also brought underwater cameras...one guy's failed as soon as he got in the water.  Somebody else had a cheap plastic one so you can't even see what your pix look like until developed.  Everyone loved this one and was asking where I got it from.If you check out other underwater camera reviews, there are so many in which people say that it failed once underwater.  There is only a VERY small percentage of reviewers that report this for this camera.  This may be b/c of user error- just something to consider.I highly recommend this camera.

Time LapseAnd, I'm disappointed with all 3 features.You can read below why or you can view this video: http://youtu.be/ddRL5ROW_2g60fps Movies:If you choose MP4, all your movie frame rates are 30fps. If I choose AVCHD, all whole bunch of 60fps options are available.If I record in AVCHD and download to a PC, no problem. If I try to import AVCHD to my MAC where I do all my movie editing, iMovie and iPhoto both don't seem to be able to import them.  Very disappointing.  I know - maybe this is Apple's problem, not Panasonic's but if they had those frame rates for the MP4 format, it wouldn't be a problem.Manual Exposure Mode:You only have two choices for aperture: F3.3 and F10, that's it.  And you don't have any choice of shutter speed.  You can choose +/- 1/3 EV, +/- 2/3 EV and +/- 1 EV.  And when you take a picture, it takes 3.  One at 0EV, and one darker and one lighter.  Dumb, dumb, dumb.  This shouldn't be called Manual Exposure mode.  I'll never use this.Time Lapse:I had a hard time finding it.  I would have thought it would be a mode on the camera, but it's hidden on page 4/5 in the setup menu.  You get to choose a shooting interval (10s, 20s, up to 1 min, then 2 min, 3 min up to 30 min) and you get to choose how many shots it will take with the maximum being 1000.  At 30fps, that means, you can only take 33 seconds of video... It actually doesn't make this into a video, it just takes individual pictures and you have to assemble them into a video.  An old Canon I had made a real video.  My old Canon could go down to .5 second (1/2 second) intervals and that was perfect for time lapse of construction workers doing something.  10 seconds is WAAAAAAAYYYYYY TOOOOOO LONG.

Every time the seal for the battery/sd card compartment is opened, you risk letting in debris which could cause failure. I was extremely excited to use the new wifi features as I hoped they would limit the number of times the camera needs to be opened. The wifi features include sending pictures to an Android device (and maybe more) and using the Android device as a viewfinder and remote trigger. These features are great when they work. Unfortunately, connecting to the camera is difficult and requires me to attempt multiple times most likely due to my phone looking for a wifi signal. The best method for connecting to favorite devices that I have found is as follows: Turn off wifi on device. Turn on camera's wifi. Enter Pin (password for camera's wifi). Click favorite connections. When the camera is looking for the connection, open the app on the device. Turn on wifi on device. Go back to App quickly before it can connect anywhere. Hit refresh until you see the TS5 connection. Click on the TS5 connection and you should be connected. If you don't see the TS5 connection, turn off the wifi, turn it back on and refresh the app again.Once connected the remote shutter works great. just put the camera on a tripod and snap away with your smartphone; no camera shake! When going for hikes, I can set the camera up walk to where it is pointing, and line myself up for a picture. When ready snap away again.The other feature that makes this camera stand out is the weather proofing. I bought this to go places my cell phone cannot go. Rainy hikes, pool days, skiing, beach days, etc are the types of places I will bring this camera and if performance is anything like the TS-3 model, I will be very happy.GPS - I love this feature. It Geo tags the photos so you can relive your vacation and see where you were! While connected to the GPS satilites, the camera shows your coordinates and altitude. Great for hikes. If you know the height of a stop point, just track your progress on the camera.Dark pictures - I have found using the built in HDR mode and the Starry sky mode produce the best dark/night photos. Starry sky has a shutter time of 15 or 30 seconds (plus processing time) and grabs all light from the area.I have not had it very long yet so I can not comment on its durability, or how well the seals hold up. The TS-3 died in 18 months but this camera has been redesigned so I am hopeful for longer life. The great pictures and features of the TS-3 made me give Panasonic another chance.I have a couple more minor complaints:Battery - Seems to die somewhat faster the the older model. It lasts for a couple of hours of use. The camera is still very usable. I am only commenting because it was disappointing.difficult buttons - I find the buttons more difficult to push and spaced a bit too close. This is in no way a deal breaker though.I recommend this camera but be aware of the downfalls. It seems very well built, is easy to use (minus the wifi) and the pictures come out fantastic.", "Date": "April 13, 2013"}, {"Title": "Not Water proof!", "Author": "Tech Dad \"T Daddy\"", "ReviewID": "R32HPGHVO1CKAB", "Overall": "1.0", "Content": "I got this for my vacation and invested in the expensive Marine case for Scuba dives and while the camera worked well in the case as soon as i walked into the ocean without the extra case just 5 feet deep it filled with water and died.If I knew this would only work with the $300 extra case I would have selected another camera..

I'm very displeased with this, although other reviews had mentioned this fact. (edit feb 2014)  I use this camera all the time, it totally replaced my ZS-19, it's one heck of a camera, and I could only be happier if there wasn't lens motor noise in videos.  it'd definitely get a 5 star review from me if not for this fact. (end edit)Other then that, it does appear to take good pictures,  and the waterproof/dustproof will be really nice. I'm tired of having to replace a lumix zs series every six months or so due to dust in the lenses. I've owned six or so zs series over the last few years, and I really loved them, just need a more robust camera.Again,  if you plan to ever record ambient video with audio, DO NOT BUY THIS CAMERA.I've had this camera over a month now,  it takes really good pictures, in most cases as good as the pictures my Lumix DMC-ZS19.  Battery life is as good as the ZS19,  as long as you remember to set up airplane mode.  (airplane mode turns OFF gps when the camera is off, otherwise GPS is always on)  A little annoying is that every time you open the door to remove the memory card or replace the battery, it reminds you to check and ensure the door is closed.It turns on very quickly, faster then the DMC series, which is really useful.The time lapse feature is excellent, and the 'hand held night shot' mode takes far better pictures then I'd ever expect it to, as is the starry night mode, in either 15second or 30second shutter.The noise in video is really unfortunate, as it takes quite good video at max resolution.I'll probably have to give up and buy a GoPro for my active videos, since Contour is out of business, and the new Sony doesn't record sound at most FPSAll in all, I'm very happy with this camera, and pull it out 99% of the time vs the DMC-ZS19,  due to its durability.", "Date": "September 17, 2013"}, {"Title": "\u00bfQue?

I've owned this camera for about 6 weeks and taken it on one extended trip.  The camera has never been dropped or used outside of its stated design parameters.  Despite my careful handling of this camera the top button on the dpad has become stuck, and no longer functions correctly.  I contacted customer support, and was told I would have to pay to send it in for repair, and that the repair process would likely take over 2 weeks.  I requested an advanced replacement (paying in advance for the new camera, and receiving a refund when Panasonic receives the original malfunctioning unit), and I was told that this was not an option.  I requested that Panasonic at least pay for shipping since the camera is nearly new, I am (but no longer) a loyal repeat Panasonic customer, the camera is about twice as expensive as its competition, and I have never requested service from Panasonic in the past.  I was told this was not possible either.  Panasonic does not seem very interested in maintaining customer loyalty.  I willing paid for the extra cost of this camera over its competition in the belief that I was getting a higher quality item with better customer service.  Unfortunately, that belief seems to be in error.  I would suggest to prospective purchasers of this camera that they purchase a less expensive alternative brand since this camera's higher price does not seem to net you much over the lower priced competition.Pros:-seems well built (aside from sticking button)-battery lasts much longer than the last generation-camera UI is mostly straightforward-gps photo tagging is great when the camera has a location fixCons:-each panasonic point and shoot model (including new generations of the same model) seems to use a different proprietary battery--- neither of the batteries from my other recent point and shoot Lumix cameras fit this model--- other people on my trip had new and older Lumix P&S; cameras and none of the batteries were interchangeable-to get a good photo you really need good light (and some luck)-for gps photo tagging to function correctly you need a location fix which can take up to several minutes (an eternity when you're worried about your batteries lasting for another 2 weeks)-wifi setup and usage is not intuitive-As far as I've been able to determine, the only way to charge the battery is to place it in the battery charging tray and plug it into AC current.  This is really annoying when you are one multi-day (week) trips and there is no outlet handy.  I haven't discovered any way to charge a battery via USB (either in or out of the camera).

Heavy handed noise reduction - all these tough/waterproof cameras seem to have strong noise reduction algorithms, but the TS5 seems to have the heaviest of the bunch.  This has the effect of waxy skin tones and loss of detail.3. Good and bad video qualities - 1080p at 60 fps takes silky smooth video.  But like many other reviewers have noted, there is a noticeable ticking sound generated by the camera in quieter environments.  Unacceptable!4. No Macintosh support!  Panasonic does not supply any Mac software to download photos/videos.  Also, AVCHD video is difficult to extract onto Macs.  60 fps is only available in the AVCHD format, negating the TS5's video quality advantage over its peers.5. Other peculiarities - NFC did not work with my Nexus 7 tablet.  The battery charger has a separate cord (really, in this day and age?).  The USB interface uses a proprietary interface, instead of the practically standard micro USB.In the end, this camera failed to deliver on what a point and shoot camera should be - easy to use with a minimum of work to extract useable photos and videos.

Unfortunately the camera believes that pretty much all indoor shoots to be a \"low light\" scenes.That happens probably because of high ISO the camera tries to setup at the first possible chance.Even shooting outdoor (it was quite cloudy there but anyway it was a late morning!) on tele the camera setup ISO of 320 which caused some noise/graininess to be noticeable. If you go with ISO 100-200 it is quite nice, however.Also very strange logic the camera utilizes - if I shoot a scene with flash (in a low light) - it setups ISO at 800 and make exposure around 1/60.But when I shoot the same scene without flash - exposure goes up to 1/2-1/4 (which is totally understandable) but the ISO goes down to 400!One additional thing to mention: a few days after I bought it, the camera started making some \"clicking\" noise when I took it in my hand and shake it gently.Like something is moving inside and bouncing back and forth. I asked Panasonic technical support and they said it was something that should be looked at.WiFi is clumsy and very odd - the camera cana) transfer images to your PC (upload files to smb share),b) upload pictures to your smartphone,c) upload pictures to web services like Flickr, Picasa, Facebook etc.d) Upload pictures to Panasonic's cloud storage server,e) be managed remotely from your smartphone,f) display pictures on an external AV device,g) print pictures on a printer,so seven functions in total. So far so good.Now guess - how many times you'll have to enter your WiFi settings (like an SSID if it is hidden for security purposes and encryption key) if you stay with the same network and decide to try all these nice features?If you say \"one\" - you are wrong. SEVEN TIMES! Yes, the password for your wifi network is a property of an \"action\" you choose so if you just entered your 20-symbols password to uploads photos to your computer and decided to upload a couple of them to your Facebook page straight from the camera - be ready to enter the password again. Very annoying.Luckily those settings could be saved and reused later but if you want to do the same \u0446\u0440\u0448\u0434\u0443 being connected to your friend's network - be prepared to repeat the all those steps again.Display image is good - nice and sharp, has auto back-light option so camera adjusts brightness of the screen automatically.Controls are relatively small and when you press those buttons - you cannot hear \"click\" or get good haptic feedback as in normal cameras.This is probably due to some level of toughness the camera provide, it feels unusual at the beginning but a few days later you get used to it.PROS:good design and feeling how it sits in your hands,good video quality,a lot of WiFi options (when you eventually go through that glitches I described above - it works),remote management over WiFi is a really nice feature,optical image stabilization does a good job,logically organized menu with descriptions to every optionCONS:low image quality at low light conditions - that is my primary complainsometimes visible distortions on a wide end if you shoot something that is closed to you.illogical WiFi settingsIt is difficult to compare with other competitors because I have not used them. Actually it is my first point-and-shoot camera after DSLR so this is why I may be so demanding about picture quality.However looking at photos that were taken from Olympus TG-2 and Nikon AW110 it looks like those chaps have (much) better photo quality, especially for indoor environment.", "Date": "May 7, 2013"}, {"Title": "MOORE THAN EXPECTED", "Author": "Jaime M.", "ReviewID": "R2HSWOWIH0RYIE", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "MY FIRST LUMIX CAMERA WAS  FROM THE EARLY DIGITAL CAMERAS!!I USED SO MUCH THAT I DESTROYED  THE CAMERA!.ONE REAZON FOR BUYN THE CAMERA WAS THE  LEYCA LENS.THE BEST ,THIS LUMIX CAMERA IS REAL GOOD IM GETTING GREAT PICTURES AND WITH ALL THE NEW EXTRAS ,WATER  AND FALL RESISTANCE,,  UFF I LOV IT!!GREAT EXPECTATIONS!!", "Date": "March 10, 2014"}, {"Title": "Great camera, but I haven't tested it under water yet.", "Author": "Chrissy", "ReviewID": "R3MDS9ZT7Y4FQE", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "We bought this to replace our canon power shot sd1300.  Overall, the camera is very user friendly, and durable so our 2 year old can handle it without worry.  Most of the photo options are available within a couple clicks, a few are hidden within the menu (multiple photos per second for example)  I have tried a few other photo options, but the best seems to be intelligent autofocus, which is the default setting on the camera.  Another feature that is really cool is the ability to take multiple photos per second.  I found the 5 frames per second to be very useful when taking photos of your dog or children who tend to move a bit.  I tried the sport setting for this and was disappointed in the photo quality; most movement photos showed blurr; maybe because the photos were taken inside.  The flash is good for inside photos in dimly lit rooms, but doesn't work as well in dark areas.Video quality is on par with our video camera.  There is also the option of super slow motion video, and 1080p, but if you plan on using that feature often I'd recommend a high performance SD card because the video takes longer to write to the card.  With lower performance SD cards it takes longer and some of the older cards can't even handle it at all.  I checked out about SD card performance on SDcard.org.  There is no reason to pay $100 for an SD card unless you are taking two hour videos in 1080p or something equivalent, but you need at least a SDHC(10) or better for hd video.  I have a SDHC 10 and I have to wait about 30 seconds or so after shooting video for the data to be fully written to the card.  This may be more of an issue to others but for me it was't a big deal.  Just know that it isn't the camera's fault.  Every camera has this issue.  It's the card's.Wi-fi sounds like a gimmick, but if you are taking this underwater, which we fully intend to do, it will be much safer to upload photos wirelessly, than risk water damage from opening the waterproof door to take the SD card out for uploading photos every time.  It can be a handy feature.  That becomes irrelevant when you still have to open the door to charge the battery, however.  So, until they come up with a way to charge the battery without opening the door WiFi is still just a gimmick to me.  I don't have a smart phone to test the NFC technology, but I can see where it could be useful to some people as long as they have a phone that is compatible.  If this is an important feature to you, it would be wise to check with Panasonic for a list of compatible phones to see if you can use this feature.  I bet the majority of people can't.I haven't been outside with the camera yet.  I haven't taken it under water yet.  I haven't dropped it on the ground or my tile floor yet.

I admit that I haven't fully utilized every feature yet, but I've played around with different still-camera modes, as well as the video function.The main reasons for 4 stars and not 5 are minor. First, the audio quality from the top mounted stereo microphones is good, but overly compressed in loud settings. It's good because you get good clarity without distortion, but not so good because it doesn't provide an accurate mix of the audio. I've used it mainly in loud music venues, and that's where my experience comes from.Another little ding against this camera comes because of the proprietary USB connector. Really?? Why not go with a micro-USB like everybody else?? And I wish the battery charger was one-piece that plugs directly into the outlet like Canon's, instead of having a long, detachable cable that I can lose now.Otherwise the various still modes are really cool.

The failure of this camera has prompted me to do so. That alone should tell you something.First, be forewarned that movies take with the Panasonic Lumix DMC-TS5 are split up into multiple files in multiple folders on the memory chip. That means no file that is easy to move around and, in my case, it does not import into iPhoto, as a single .mov file does, so that with this camera I cannot keep all the photos and movies from a single hike in one place together. Okay, I'll just shoot my hike videos on my iPhone. Pain in the a** having to use two devices, but it's a viable work-around.Worse yet -- and this is a real deal killer -- the Panasonic Lumix DMC-TS5 randomly borks a photo's geocode such that the lat & long are set to some impossible to interpret value such as 17056881.853375 , where the lat should be some valid value like 33.237572 , while the long is some valid value like -111.131239 . The wierd part is, it is not consistent. Sometimes the geocode is good, but most of the time it is garbage. Now, my iPhone ocassionally throws a photo's geocode off by a half mile, but it *never* munges a geocode so completely it is impossible to interpret.
