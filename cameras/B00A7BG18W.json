EXCEPT FEW THINGS :/ because the picture shows the camera that looks good. but when i got THE CAMERA it was really small. I like everything that on there but except the camera... it said the camera is high and better then normal qualities... but it wasn't... it was really bad... i couldn't see anything. i thought it was just 1st try... but i used it so many times and i wasn't happy with what I've got... the pictures and videos qualities are really s***... i didn't used this camera for a month or more... i'm thinking of selling this one and get new one... or give it to friend for FREE. i do love everything that I've got... but only the problem is the camera... if the camera is PERFECT then i would really buy more things at Amazon... I don't know i could trust Amazon anymore... i guess it was because... it's less then $100?.... i thought 12 MP is big but it's not.... this camera is S***... feel like less then 10 or 5 MP... DON'T CALL ME FOR THIS AGAIN! I JUST TELLING YOU THE TRUTH... TRUTH IS... THIS CAMERA IS CRAP...(IF ANYONE READ THIS... WRITE SOMETHING NICE ABOUT THE AMAZON... LIE IF YOU CAN... BECAUSE IF YOU DON'T... THEY WILL CALL YOU... REALLY REALLY THEY WILL, THEY WILL CALL YOU...) :D", "Date": "March 4, 2013"}], "ProductInfo": {"Price": "$92.39", "Features": "12Mp Resolution\n2.4\" LCD Screen\n35mm Lens\nSD/SDHC Memory Card Slot\n5x Digital Zoom", "Name": "Kodak Easyshare C1505 12 MP Digital Camera with 5x Digital Zoom (Black) 16GB Package 2", "ImgURL": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/51%2BA87kyOeL._SY300_.jpg", "ProductID": "B00A7BG18W"}}
