I bought this camera to use not only for snorkeling and underwater adventures, but also just to take pictures at the beach and in the pool.  It works really well - a huge improvement from the disposable underwater cameras that I used to buy for vacations. I used it for a week straight in the Cayman Islands and did not experience any issues at all. The underwater pictures were very bright and clear for the most part. I even used it to capture some pictures of a sunset and the colors in the sky came out beautifully. I read some reviews where people complained that it did not take good pictures at night.  I did not use this camera at night so I cannot comment on this, however I would not let that deter you since the purpose of this camera is mainly for underwater daytime use. To keep this camera working properly, I took the advice of other reviewers and made sure I rinsed the camera off in fresh water after being in the ocean or pool every day.  It's also important to keep sand away from the camera to avoid any jams in the trigger.", "Date": "December 12, 2013"}, {"Title": "A great camera!!!!", "Author": "Tammy H.", "ReviewID": "RE5ZCEHYAQFLJ", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I purchased this for my six year old grand daughter for her birthday......

We had some sea-side escapes planned and I wanted to be able to bring a waterproof camera into the water while we were swimming and snorkeling. This was exactly what I was looking for. I'm sure the calm, crystal blue Aegean Sea may have been a factor in how well the underwater pictures turned out, but these came out better than some other camera reviewer's photos taken in a pool! We didn't take many night-time shots, so I can't comment on that, but day time, underwater, and pics while the camera was wet came out crystal clear. Would definitely recommend this camera to anyone.

I read the reviews that the pictures aren't superb underwater, but since I was hoping NOT to take it underwater, no problem there.Well, all of my indoor pictures are blurry or fuzzy or just not good. Some of the outdoor pictures come out pretty well. It is not a camera I want to use to capture everyday memories. It's kind of...a dud. I'm sorry I bought it. I have no plans to go snorkeling any time soon, and I like to like my picture, if you know what I mean, which I don't when I use this camera.Another down side of this camera is that there is nothing to protect the lens. I mean, it has an outer part (probably what makes all my pictures blurry is this outer glass layer), but there is no way to close it, so it gets dirty very easily.I guess I just need an easier to use point-and-click and to NOT go into lakes with it. That is my new game plan, and I'm back to my other camera (coincidentally also a Nikon Coolpix, but not waterproof -- takes great pictures but has a funky problem where it randomly turns off while I'm trying to use it).I'll save this camera for the kids to use.

Continued trial and error showed the solution - a more detailed instruction pack could have headed off twenty minutes of frustration. The camera did exactly what I needed it to - provided me with pictures when I went to notoriously misty waterfalls, captured shots and videos of gorgeous tropical fish underwater.I had no experience of a faulty battery pack door, and the camera itself is very rugged, resisting blows when underwater currents knock you about in the sea. My one complaint is the picture quality when using the zoom: the camera takes its best shots close to the subject. Pictures of Toucans in the dewy mist are hazy, but not from the moisture!The camera delivers what it sets out to, with silly features like the mirror shots, fish-eye lens and soft focus editing options.

I end up having to put it on flash all the time because the auto-flash is unreliable and more than half the time doesnt detect when its really needed. The recording is alright but not great either, the sound is good though. Its a very very simple and boring camera, since its meant to be waterproof and sealed, i guess they decided to forgo any detailed buttons, or options on camera operation. It takes some getting used to, because theres not a whole lot you can do with the camera. For the purpose of taking pictures in wet or water area, its good, and doesnt give me problems, but its not my go to camera AT ALL for anything that doesnt have to do with water. This camera will most likely sit in a drawer until I need it for water purposes. As for the body of the camera, its sealed pretty well, but the area where the battery and sd card go, the cover seems flimsy and not really sealed, i worry that if its submerged in water, the sd card and battery could be damaged, i havent submerged it yet, but this is just my observation. I have a warranty for water damage, since i bought the 2 year one, so its covered, but it would be inconvenient if this did happen, thats all. So yea, thats my opinion.

I wanted a waterproof, shockproof camera because I live near the water and take a lot of photos on the beach. I think I ruined my last camera because some sand probably got in it.  Nikon has a good reputation so I purchased it on that and the price. Though I like taking good photos I hold back on putting a lot of money in a camera because the camera is so delicate.  This camera has been a disappointment in clearity of photos and ease of use. I find it inconsistant on quality.  Some closeups come out ok - but for the most part it's a poor point and shoot camera.  I haven't used it that much.  I tried to get photos of my grandson performing at his school, but was unable to get good clarity.  I have had several small point and shoot cameras.
