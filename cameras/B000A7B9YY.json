You can go with a wide choice of automatic modes or control the aperture, shutter, ISO, etc. settings yourself. It may not be a camera for professional photographers, but for  amatuers who wants more than a \"point a shoot\", this camera is great. Like many compact cameras, the SP-350's built in flash has a limited range, but unlike many others, the SP-350 has a \"hot shoe\" (which the 7.1 megapixel SP-310 lacks) so you can add a more powerful flash. Olympus makes a very compact flash unit, the FL-20, as well as more powerful units, labelled FL-36 and FL-50. Telephoto (1.7x) and wide angle (.7x) conversion lenses are also available. The ability to use regular AA batteries is a real plus for travel. I considered many cameras, including the Canon Powershot SD-550, the Casio Elixim Ex-Z750 , and the Nikon Coolpix L1. I wanted quality images, some manual control, and a camera that is comfortable to hold. The SP-350 feels natural in one average sized hand. My pictures shot with the SP-350 have been excellent.  Finally, for what you get, the price is quite reasonable.  There are many good digital cameras, my advice is to get the one which you are comfortable with.", "Date": "November 11, 2005"}, {"Title": "A great little camera!!", "Author": "Peter Gaffney", "ReviewID": "R1X1XPS710U83T", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I bought this camera after finding that my EOS 20D was too cumbersome for hiking in the Sierras.  After shooting about 40 images of both friends and scenery, i can only say that the results are spectacular.  Images are wonderfully sharp, colors are very true and vivid and the exposure meter does a first rate job under a variety of lighting conditions.  The camera is easy to use, (although the power button could stand to be two-sizes bigger,) and it nests very comfortably on the strap inside a jacket, out of the way and weighing practically nothing, yet readily accessible for those sudden shots.I've used several generations of Canon Powershot cameras in the past, as well as the very excellent 20D and I was sceptical about this camera after reading a previous negative review.  I have to say that I'm completely sold - a great hiking camera that is also perfect for everyday use.", "Date": "November 25, 2005"}, {"Title": "An advanced amateur camera at a point and shoot price.", "Author": "Carl M. Flarity", "ReviewID": "R2I9YJDIMIOOUP", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I bought this camera for myself as a Christmas present four months ago. The longer I've owned and used it, the more I appreciate it. As noted in the other reviews, it takes sharp, brilliant pictures that make great 81/2 X 11 prints (or larger I suppose).The first thing that caught my attention on this camera is the hot shoe. Very unusual in this size and price range. I've purchased the FL-36 flash unit so I can do bounce flash. This avoids the \"deer in the headlights\" look you usually get with an on-camera flash. The bounce flash pictures I've taken look as if no flash was used at all - great! I'm considering getting the hot shoe extension cable to give me even more flexibility in the use of the flash. If you hold a direct flash more than a couple feet away from the camera you don't get red-eye.As an advanced amateur photographer, I appreciate the ability to manually control the shutter speed, aperture and even manually focus the lens as needed. Of course, you can set it to full Auto and let the camera do all the thinking if you want. If you press the shutter release half way it will focus and set the exposure. Then press the shutter the rest of the way to avoid delay in actually taking the picture.I've also been taking quite a few (spectacular) macro photographs with this camera. It focuses very closely in normal mode. It gets even closer in macro mode. As in most other cameras, you lose zoom capability in macro mode. I'm a little disappointed that the smallest aperture is F8 rather than F16 (or better still F22 or F32). A smaller aperture would give more depth of field for macro photography. But I get by okay with F8.When I first got the camera I tried using alkaline AA batteries instead of the disposable CRV-3 lithium battery. This did not work well at all. I only got about ten shots before the batteries were declared dead by the camera. They were actually NOT dead. It's just that the camera needs a higher Voltage than alkalines can deliver when only slightly used. So I bought a rechargeable lithium battery, which works extremely well in this camera even though it's not listed in the specifications given by Olympus. Unfortunately, although it fits in the flash unit, the rechargeable lithium does not work in the FL-36. Its Voltage is actually too high (higher than the disposable lithium) and the flash unit shuts itself down after two seconds.  The AA alkalines work fine in the flash unit but the disposable lithium CRV-3 gives faster recycling times.I also purchased the 1.7x Tele Conversion Lens as well as the Wide angle lens. You also need to purchase an adapter tube to use either accessory lens. (They are over-priced.) The Tele Conversion lens blocks a corner of the optical view finder. The wide angle lens blocks most of the view finder. This can be a problem when you use the camera out of doors where the LCD is not usable because of the bright light. The front end of the adapter tube is 37mm but uses a non-standard thread so you can't put filters or other accessory lenses on it. I have since discovered that there is an adapter tube made by another company with a standard 37mm thread on the front. I can now install a polarizing (or other) filter on my SP-350. There are a large number of (non-Olympus) 37mm accessory lenses that will work with the SP-350 using this adapter tube. I'm having a lot of fun with the wide-angle fisheye lens I bought. Do a Google search for this stuff.I noticed they have recently introduced a faster version of the xD memory card. If I didn't already own the slower version I would pay extra for the faster one. I recommend buying either the 512 Meg or one Gigabyte card.", "Date": "April 17, 2006"}, {"Title": "Great, but Just a Little Shy", "Author": "ChrisBrogan", "ReviewID": "R335EG9J28FTCZ", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "I'm a big fan of Olympus cameras.

It has a built in speaker for sounds. The picture quality is outstanding, sharp vivid colors. I have had some of my shots printed, and they are beautiful. As with any digital camera, you have to focus before you shoot. It has a sweet spot for focusing on your subject, just be patient and let it focus before you shoot.

I took a lot of pictures with it. I wanted an 8 megapixel camera next. I looked at the C-8080 wide angle but never bought it. When the SP-350 came out I thought this might be the one.I was going on a trip to Eastern Europe and decided to pull the trigger. I bought the camera and the two lenses that go with it. The first thing I noticed was the size, IT'S HALF AS BIG AS THE C-4000. And the wide-angle lens is \u00bc the size of the C-4000 wide-angle lens.The camera takes unbelievable pictures; it even takes pictures in RAW format. So I'm thinking great camera right, well.When I get to Europe the camera works fine with the batteries that come with the camera. I couldn't believe how long the \"stock\" ones lasted. But as everyone knows you need to have rechargeable batteries with any digital camera. So I brought along 4 sets of 2300milamp AA.Well I was in Eastern Europe between Christmas and New Years. And as you would think it's cold, to say the least. The batteries kept dieing really fast, like take 5 pictures and the camera battery indicator light comes on. I can't tell you how frustrating this was.  So I chalked it up to the cold, and pressed on.Well it's not the cold; it's the firmware in the camera. After I called Olympus they told me there might be a problem with my cameras firmware, and I would need to upgrade it. After I upgraded the firmware, it's working just fine now.I'm still giving the camera 5 stars because it's got a lot of shooting functions, it's easy to use, even though it's more complicated, it's small and compact, and as I found out you can upgrade the firmware. It's a more complicated camera then the C-4000 but if you're the type that likes more functions then this it the one for you to.", "Date": "March 7, 2006"}, {"Title": "An easy to use camera with a lot of creative control", "Author": "Joe D \"RealGuns.Com\"", "ReviewID": "R2ME5P4VG58N13", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "This is my second Olympus in this price and feature range and it has been great to use for informal snap shots, as well as for formal shooting with external flash and photo floods.

Yes, I have high end SLR products, film and digital that are used for more specialized applications, but a single camera to tuck in a pocket for a trip or day out or a quick web site shoot or family party coverage; it's a great little camera and well worth the price.The only areas where a good deal of improvement could be made are availability of accessories like filter adapters, chargers, and auxilary lenses and a price reduction on typical accessories like flash units and PC hot shoe adapters.", "Date": "April 28, 2006"}, {"Title": "Power and Performance in a little black box.", "Author": "South Central Library Emporium \"Library Emporium\"", "ReviewID": "R2K2N7W7CUQIE4", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "Huge LCD and DC power make this a great camera for professional use.

The menus are very easy to navigate through as well. My only gripe with this camera is the way it eats up batteries. If you plan to shoot all day, you might want to bring at least 4 extra AAs. Or you can spend the money and purchase a lithium ion, which might last a little bit longer.

Eckel", "ReviewID": "R2BR9SLL1P0K1W", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "When I received this camera, a 3 volt battery was provided. This battery lasted a long time but was not rechargable. After this battery went dead, things turned bad in the battery department. The tech info said Alkalines or NIMH rechargables will work. Unfortunately, they only worked for about 4 or 5 pictures before the camera shut down. The Alkalines were worst, lasting two or three shots before shutting down. The rechargables were new 6 months ago and work just fine in my other Olympus cameras (C3200 & C4000). I discovered there is a firmware upgrade so I did it. The batteries run longer but the low battery indicator still comes on after a few shots which is annoying. It doesn't seem to stop the camera now but the indicator being on all the time means you don't know when the batteries are REALLY low. I bought new rechargables and these do keep the indicator off so I must believe it is simply set too sensitive to battery voltage and the firmware was to simply make it work regardless of the indication. It did nothing to reset the indicator turn on point. My guess is that in six months, the new rechargables will give the same false indicator as my other ones do now.The camera only comes with some small amopunt of internal RAM but not enough to be useful since high quality 8 MP files are large. I see no point in buying a camera such as this and using it in the lowest resolution, therefore, I had to purchase a memory card for it immediately.The camera does take fine pictures and has some nice features. The monitor is bright enough and the size for such a full featured camera is perfect for stowing in a pants pocket. Olympus maintained the bump where the batteries go and that makes for a more solid hand grip. Larger hands need something to grab onto and this provides that. Too many cameras, in an effort to be ultra compact, forget the need to actually hold the device steady while taking a photo. Having 8 MP of blurry image does no good for anyone.I have printed frames on a large format plotter and have some beautiful three foot by five foot prints from it (yes, that is FEET). People cannot believe the prints are from a digital camera unless they examine the print VERY closely so prints in a typical album size are as crisp as the printer is capable of printing them.Overall, it is a good camera but Olympus could have done MUCH better regarding the batteries and how well the low indicator performs. My older cameras did not have these problems and they still don't have any problems and I've shot many thousands of frames with each without incident.", "Date": "January 3, 2007"}, {"Title": "A great little point and shooter for day trips - only the small zoom and very slow capture disappoints a little", "Author": "Keith Joseph", "ReviewID": "R38MUN0NG1UNJF", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "This is a very comfortable, lightweight and small 8MP camera that produces very good photos in varied conditions (even flash). I use cheap hi-power 2700 mH AA rechargeable batteries (2) and battery life is fine considering it's just two batteries. Others have reported poor battery life, but it's normally the battery indicator is lying and you need a firmware upgrade to correct the bug (easy, if a little risky, with the Olympus supplied software). Mind you even with the firmware upgrade, batteries don't last long at all, so pack 6 spares (and only use hi-power rechargables or expensive lithium packs). So you need a camera case that can pack more batteries, and a charger. Focus is quite good and fairly fast to lock if the menu is set to central focus and lock, rather than continuous hunting mode. Image quality is very good (for the price) and images are generally well exposed (rarely if ever overexposed) with a vivid attractive colour balance, and ASA goes up to 400 if needed - although at higher ASAs image noise (speckles & fuzz) is very noticable when magnified. There is a very good set of menu options enabling you to remove chirping camera sounds and annoying flash assisted focus, plus more pro options like focus modes & lock, ASA, many `scene' modes etc.. You can use an external flash (but it'll probably cost more than the camera) and a fun waterproof housing (twice the cost of the camera). We have a selection of xD cards but even a 512Mb one only holds 250 pictures in 3,264 x 2,176 HQ jpg mode. A 1Gb H (highspeed) Olympus Xd card works OK. Transfer to PC seems quite fast compared to my E500 SLR (as it's USB2). There's no LCD viewfinder (it's there but optical only). Fortunately the very large rear 6.4cm [2.5\"] LCD panel is great (and I can easily read the menus without glasses). It also has VGA movie with sound.The only thing I miss with this good little camera is a large zoom. The 3x just isn't as flexible as the image stabilised 12x zoom on the likes of a Canon S3IS and Panasonic DMZ. In the SP350's favour you get far less finger marks on the smaller lens, it's a great deal cheaper, a lot smaller and the wife/kids aren't fussed anyway. Also the recycle time is very very slow (5s or more) with flash - you think the camera or batteries have died - perhaps try increasing the ASA instead (although image noise may then become annoying). This slow capture time has turned my wife against the camera, as she keeps missing shots waiting for the camera. Plus you must pay to upgrade the supplied software to the excellent Olympus Master `Pro' - reasonable for once as this camera is so cheap . But overall this is a great pocket-sized point and shoot camera, with a very comprehensive set of menu options should you wish to be more adventurous - a real improvement on the last generation sub $250 cameras. There simply aren't many cameras that offer shutter speed and aperture priority in this price band. It is also well worth considering as a 'cheap' second camera for places where a digital SLR (or prosumer 12x camera) is just too large and obtrusive.", "Date": "December 23, 2006"}, {"Title": "Another Great Olympus Advancement", "Author": "Peter La Barbera \"plabjazz\"", "ReviewID": "R35ICXZ6VFEZAW", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "This makes my fourth digital camera from Olympus.

I am a \"film\" geek and have 2 35 MM cameras with several lenses, plus several point and shoot cameras.  I decided to delve into the digital world as I am getting married and wanted something to take quick pics with while wedding planning.  I also foster dogs, so I needed something with instantaneous results taht I could send the Humane Society.  Here's what I think.1. it is a good size camera, easy to hold and stabilize with a lot of MP for the money.2. I use the CRV battery, and have used the same one all along at this point, and still have lots of battery power left.  I haven't tried either AA or rechargeables to check this out. One of the reasons I bought this camera however, was because I like the option of whereever I go, I can get a quick battery if I run out and don't need to wait for the battery to charge.3.  while the picture quality is not up to film quality, I am very happy with the pictures that I have taken.  At 8MP I was able to blow up some pictures on my computer screen with very little loss of resolution.  I have had some printed in 4X6 size and they are great4.  I use the current scene settings and pictures are good in both low light with the flash and outdoors in the snow.  I took pictures of me in wedding gowns when I was trying them on and all turned out good.5. Speed is a bit slow, but it is with all digital cameras as compared to a film camera.  I made some changes in the settings and that has helped a bit.  I also plan to get a high speed XD card and that should also help. I don't plan to take pictures of fast moving objects with this camera, except for puppies, so that doesn't bother me too much.6.  I like being able to zoom in on the camera screen itself.  It lets me see if I actually got the picture that I wanted.  I also like an actual view finder for those bright days, although I took some while sledding and had no problem seeing the large screen on the back.7.  I love the fact that I can get the underwater housing (which I plan on getting and again a major reason for my purchasing of this camera).8.  I like the idea of a hot shoe.  Any point and shoot camera flash is not going to carry well and usually leaves a lot to be desired in the color and lighting of the picture.9.  I like the idea of being able to get both a wide angle and a doubler for the lense.  While the zoom on this camera isn't great, you can adapt by having the doubler.  Again, I don't plan on using this as I do my 35MM so the camera zoom wasn't the most important thing to me.10.  There are many settings on this camera that I haven't even tried yet.

The drawbacks have been many.Daily I am frustrated with my camera, as I've lost many good shots. The camera in auto mode takes so long \"thinking\" that my subjects have moved on or gotten bored and impatient by the time it shoots. Sometimes I will use the shoot and select mode so I can get multiple shots and hopefully one will come out fine. But quality of lighting or focus is often sacrificed. It takes a long time thinking in general, but takes longest in auto mode.The battery drains quickly if you're using the viewer. You get more shooting time if the viewer is off. But if you turn off your camera (I turn it off often to protect the lens), it doesn't remember that you've turned off the viewer, as some other cameras do. So, you have to turn off the viewer each time (if you want to preserve battery life), which can cause you to lose a good shot.Additionally, in one year and two months, the CCD sensor gave out and we had to get it repaired. Fortunately, I had the 4-year extended service plan through Best Buy and I didn't have to pay for the costly repair or have to buy a new camera. I've learned that the type of battery that this camera uses can damage the CCD sensor if left in the camera all day long (who remembers to take out the battery every day?).If you've managed to take a picture despite the slow shutter speed, it can take some nice shots. Sometimes the color isn't so vibrant, but there is clarity and there is sharpness under the right conditions. The \"scene\" modes are nice if you're a novice like me.Bottom line, though, you're better off spending an extra couple hundred dollars for a camera with better shutter speed and longer battery life (Canon PowerShot will be my next purchase).", "Date": "March 31, 2007"}, {"Title": "I would buy it again", "Author": "A.Right \"Nothing is what I seems.

Well, I would pay  around $40-50 dollars for it. Do not be misled, this is an old camera.  I remember it was slow to acquire focus on low light. Given enough time or light it would provide the most wonderful, deep, colorful pictures.  Small enough to be handld with one hand to take a photo. The \"dating\" of the camera can be detected by the 3X zoom, which is rarely seen in updated cameras unless it is the cheap P&S;, but this was not a cheap P&S; at the time.

The still shots were pretty decent too. I bought it at Costco for $200. I carried this camera EVERYWHERE, and it took quite a beating from me so the fact that it lasted 4 years is pretty amazing. I took thousands of photos with it. First, the flash gave out in maybe the 3rd year... it first started to look too bright and everything was washed out. Finally it just didn't work at all. Then in the 4th year it started taking pics that looked photoshopped / grainy. Still, I kept using it. Finally, the poor camera just wouldn't turn on. But I would still recommend this camera (even despite the slow factor) because overall the pics were very good.For the longest time I didn't realize you had to change the adjustment settings so the volume would actually record, when you ran the video camera, and I finally figured it out (I thought it only did \"silent videos.\") So now I have a whole collection of charlie chaplin-esque clips.

I bought the Olympus D-360L 1.3 megapixel digital when it first came out several years ago, but of course it didn't do the job of my Stylus with 800 Kodak Max film which I use for travel photos. During the past couple of years I have looked at just about every available digital camera in this price range but was never happy. A few weeks ago I decided the SP-350 was about as good as it was going to get so I took the plunge. When I earned money as a photographer I owned an SLR so I liked the idea of being able to have manual control over the camera if I wanted to. So far I haven't had to use it as the auto settings seem to do the trick. I've used it in many situations, low light, indoors, night time, bright sun, shade, all variations of zooms and macro. Now, this is definitely not an $800 camera but I post the photos on my website and look at them on CDs, rarely print them out, but if you are happy with excellent point and shoot quality (I am at this stage in my life), this is the perfect camera. I bought an Olympus Memory Adapter for about $17 so I can chug the images directly into Photoshop. The colors are true and the focus sharp (yes, it does take a second to focus but I'm not shooting horse races). As I have arthritis, I love the grip on the camera even though it is smaller than any camera I have owned previously. I also like the black casing, just like my film camera (what is with silver, anyway?). And I like the large, bright, viewing screen and the self-closing lens cover. It is well-designed, comfortable, and except for needing an engineering degree to figure out how to put the carry-strap on, it is intuitive to use.

After comparing the SP-350 side by side with several other compact cameras, including a 5MP Kodak z730 and a very sharp 6MP Kodak z760, I immediately gave the SP-350 away even though it was then my only RAW-capable camera.  I was VERY disappointed in the optical quality.  I could not make a sharp 13x19 print, something that both consumer-oriented Kodak cameras could do with ease.  (Actually, the 6MP Kodak z760 is capable of a decent 18x24\" print.)Do yourself a favor:  Spend less money and get a more modern and effective S90 or G11 series Canon.

I could not do that with the Olympus. Every time I got ready to take a photo the time for the shutter to go off was extremely slow thereby losing the chance to take a great picture. The battery life is quite limited. It would drain after taking several pictures. In summary, although the camera took nice photos it was just not the one for me and if you have young kids and like to take consecutive candid photos of them, I suggest that you spend a few hundred dollars and buy a digital SLR camera.
