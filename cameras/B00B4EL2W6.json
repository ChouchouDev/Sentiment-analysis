{"Reviews": [{"Title": "Excellent camera and kit", "Author": "amazon buyer", "ReviewID": "R1UQ1J0OU7E28J", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I recieved the kit in good condition and ships fast. This kit has all the essentials for the D5200. I was suspicious about the quality of the other items in the kit, but everything is good quality. The tripod was good and sturdy. The tripod provides upto 5 feet of height which is plenty.The D5200 is exceptional and shoots razor sharp images. The color depth is really good. I have always rated Sony as a good color depth camera, but the 5200 is exceptional.I love the autofocus feature and the servo motor is on the lens system rather than the body of the camera.Movie mode is really good and you can set an autofocus for movie mode which will refocus automatically with a moving object.Burst mode take pics with a speed of 5 frames a second.The lens system has vibration reduction option to minimize blurs.This is one of the very few kits with the 64GB card option.Overall an excellent value for the price.You can get the D5200 kit in Sams's club for like $979  but it comes with a 16GB card and with a wi-fi adapter. The 16GB card is not sufficient and also the wi-fi adapter is useful only in wi-fi areas. Not very useful. Then you will end up buying a 64GB card and the other items for about $200+shipping.This kit is the bang for the buck.", "Date": "April 25, 2013"}, {"Title": "The camera is fantastic", "Author": "A. Wang", "ReviewID": "RG3PC04H139Z7", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "What I didn't find so great was the off-brand accessories are not high quality and frankly mostly useless for my purposes.  I should have saved my money and stayed away from such bundles.Note that the latest firmware is supposed to render non-Nikon batteries unusable.  Thank you Nikon.Otherwise, the pix are really great.  I took a picture of a helicopter about 100m away with a 18-200 lens (not part of this kit) and was able to tell what time it was from the pilot's wristwatch.", "Date": "January 16, 2014"}, {"Title": "great camera", "Author": "Michael P.", "ReviewID": "R1LFCNYG55CD9D", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "This was a great purchase well worth the money...we have a baby on the way tqo boxer dogs and have a beautiful lanscaped yard to take pictures of...we have been having fun learning how to use this camera", "Date": "September 4, 2013"}], "ProductInfo": {"Price": "$1,079.95", "Features": "KIT INCLUDES 15 PRODUCTS -- All BRAND NEW Items with all Manufacturer-supplied Accessories + Full USA Warranties:\n<1> Nikon D5200 Digital SLR Camera & 18-55mm G VR DX AF-S Zoom Lens (Red) + <2> Nikon 55-300mm VR DX AF-S Lens + <3> Nikon Digital SLR Camera Case +\n<4> Transcend 64GB SDXC 10 Card + <5> Spare EN-EL14 Battery + <6> Vivitar 52mm UV Glass Filter + <7> Vivitar 58mm UV Glass Filter +\n<8> ML-L3 Shutter Remote Control + <9> Precision Design 58\" Tripod + <10> PD 2.5x Tele & .45x Wide Lens + <11> HDMI to Mini-HDMI Cable +\n<12> HB-45 Lens Hood + <13> PD 6pc Complete Cleaning Kit + <14> PD Memory Card Storage Wallet + <15> LCD Monitor Screen Protectors", "Name": "Nikon D5200 Digital SLR Camera & 18-55mm G VR DX AF-S Zoom Lens (Red) with 55-300mm VR Lens + 64GB Card + Battery + Case + Tripod + Tele/Wide Lenses + Remote + Accessory Kit", "ImgURL": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/51KefV9Hm2L._SY300_.jpg", "ProductID": "B00B4EL2W6"}}
