{"Reviews": [{"Title": "Excellent Value and Wonderful Features", "Author": "AJS", "ReviewID": "RA4ZWL5NLIOZ", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "There has already been a lot said on this camera so far so I'll only add a few things.  I have never owned an SLR type camera so this was a new experience for me - in fact, after owning the camera now for a month, I am finally just figuring out how to use it to its full potential - and its potential is very high.First, let me say that this camera is an excellent value - 8 megapixels and packed with features, including the wonderful super sonic wave filter (which removes dust from the digital sensor).  The Olympus line of Digital Zuiko lenses are fantastic, including one of the kit lenses (40-150).A word to those folks like me (new to the SLR world) to clear up some confusion: a few of the reviewers have mentioned \"bad low light performance.\"  This is not a camera issue, it is more a function of the lens that is attached (or, the speed of the \"film\" (AKA sensor) that you have the camera set too).  Without getting into too much detail, kit lenses included with all of these entry-level DSLR's are not exactly the best in low light situations - they are referred to in the photographic world as \"slow\" lenses - meaning that the aperture values they have at the low end are really only good in sunny conditions - at least without setting the camera to a much faster ISO (or film speed setting).  So, in other words, the guy that said he is returning his Olympus to go get the canon kit is going to be just as unhappy with the performance of that camera in these situations as he was with the Olympus (from what I've read on the professional reviews of the canon, the kit lens is possibly the worst of all the major manufacturers).  Blurry pictures are NOT the camera's fault - they are the user - set the ISO higher to get a higher shutter speed or buy a lens with a \"faster\" aperture.  This is the same with all cameras.So where does this leave one who is interested in purchasing this camera, well there are two options (at least in my opinion):1.  Buy the 14-45 and 40-150 kit.  This really is an excellent value, and while the 14-45 lens isn't bad (it's very good outdoors), the 40-150 lens is fantastic.  Search any major review - especially those folks that are enthusiasts about olympus and they'll tell you the same - this lens is remarkable for the price.  However, if you do buy this kit (like I did), and you're planning on taking a lot of pics indoors or in low light situations, do yourself a favor and upgrade to the 14-54 f/2.8-3.5 Digital zuiko lens.  This is the kit lens for the professional Olympus DSLR - the E-1.  I purchased this recently and the difference is night and day compared to the kit 14-45 f3.5-5.6.  The camera has no issues in low light situations, and the \"speed\" of the lens is fantastic.  (BTW, I bought this off of ebay for $400 - I think amazon has it for about $430 with free shipping - so it's probably a toss up. (this price BTW is much cheaper than upgrading to comparable lenses of competitors like canon and Nikon - remember, you're going to have to do it no matter which camera you buy if you want good indoor/low light performance).2.  If I had to do it over again, I may have just bought the body.  Save yourself $200 and just buy the e-500 body.  Then take that $200 and apply it to the price of the 14-54 f2.8-3.5 lens - this would put the total purchase around $1000 and you'll have a fantastic lens to really learn how the camera works in all situations.  So how do you get the great 40-150 lens? I noticed that there are probably 10 on sale on ebay at any given time (from people that are upgrading to the absolutely wonderful 50-200 digial zuiko zoom) for around $100-125.Whichever option you choose, you really can't go wrong - this is a wonderful camera for a beginner or serious amateur in SLR photography.Good luck and welcome to the olympus family!", "Date": "January 21, 2006"}, {"Title": "Many blame the hardware but its almost ALWAYS the user.

I recently purchased the E-500 dual lens kit for a fraction of the cost and must say that my brother and I both agree it is by FAR the best bang for the buck.At the level 98% of us are at it is all user error and not camera error when our pictures don't come out as we would like (most professionals even say its mostly user error or lack of knowledge).  I still have a friend who uses a small 2001-Canon S230 and takes pictures that are far better then most of mine.In low light I have noticed that my E500 does not focus as fast as my brothers 20D (but it definitely still focuses) but from reading online with firmware upgrades they remedied this problem in the E300.We both also agreed that it felt better in our hands (grip and general ergonomics) and was quite a bit lighter then the 20D as well.He ,just as myself, LOVED the rear LCD controls for everything from ISO to flash speed and exposure, far more easier and quicker then the 20D for a newbie such as myself.  But he commented saying it would have been nice if it had the small simple LCD up top that the canons do as a supplement to the detailed and informative one of the back.PQ was amazing requiring very little PP, and with the vivid setting we both agreed that the colors did feel better and more vibrant (of course with a small PP Tweak the 20D was right there but for the casual photographer as myself I shy away from PP).Bottom line we were both floored at what a phenomenal deal this kit is for the price.---------- UPDATED 3/29/2006 ------------Everything said above still holds true, and I must say this is one of the few purchases that almost 6 months later Im still VERY happy with and use it frequently.  Through no advertising or sales pitch I have created 3 new customers for Olympus's E500 kit up to date.My brother has over $4000 now invested in his camera and he still finds it amusing that my little old $700 kit gets as much attention from all our friends as it does.  He recently upgraded to the 580EX flash and a new Wide angel L series lens, and I must admit VERY VERY amazing hardware bursting 3 or 4 pictures WITH flash is very cool.But we recently went to India to tour Agra, see the Taj Mahal, Sikhanders tomb, and other such sites on the way.  At the end of the trip without PP during the day my pictures looked better (we both agreed) and thats all I cared about (mainly talking about color saturation and not detail, just over all presentation).  I will admit though in a couple action shots from our speeding bus his camera did perform better, and in the evening some of mine didnt focus properly while his did on the same subject, but Im not a pro, I just enjoy the hobby.One of my better purchases in recent years.His camera IS better, mine is just a better deal, it's all about peace of mind..", "Date": "November 7, 2005"}, {"Title": "A digital camera for the traditional photographer", "Author": "David Bradford", "ReviewID": "R2EG6DRXPZFSMB", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I should preface this review by saying I'm a bit of a Luddite:  I hang on to the traditional tools in my primary fields of interest--music (both listening and performing) and photography.  To me the Nikon F2 (well, OK, I'll stretch my endorsement to something as technically advanced as the aperture-priority F3) are the quintessential cameras: rugged, natural in the hand, and immune to the demons that possess electronic devices.Then four years ago, my father gave me my first digital camera, a Minolta.  I was initially skeptical, but I quickly came to enjoy the convenience of the camera.  Then, when I paired with it the right printer (an Epson Photo R-800), I became a confirmed user, if not yet a fan.  Based on that camera-printer combination (with the addition of a scanner for the conversion of my B&W; negatives), I packed up my darkroom and offered it to the local public schools.But even though I was happy with the print quality of the digital setup, I still missed the heft and the old SLRs, and I lamented the loss of control they offered me.Then, based on fairly extensive reading of advance reviews, I decided to buy the Olympus E-500.This camera is a revelation to me.  I can't compare it to its competitors (none of which I've used extensively), but I can say that this camera fully reconciles me  to digital photography.  It gives me that reassuring \"whump\" when I press the shutter (rather than that puny \"snick\"), offers me total control in manual mode, allows the flexibilty of interchangable lenses, and--most importantly--seems to be to have as its paradigm (sorry for the word choice) the ways of a photographer trained on manual film cameras (rather than catering the \"point and shoot\" audience).The menus are easily mastered, the features (including filters in B&W; mode!) are remarkable, the battery lasts for hours of heavy shooting, and the images--even with the equivalent of a 300MM focal length--are stunning.This is a remarkable camera at a very reasonable price.", "Date": "November 5, 2005"}, {"Title": "Olympus E500 the perfect DSLR entry level.", "Author": "D.

But it IS very good, and at the prices Olympus has been selling it for. It is a downright remarkable value.Size/Weight - As I write this, it is the lightest DSLR on the market.  A major selling point IMO, after a couple of hours 3 or 4 extra ounces can feel like a ton.  Size is about average though.Comfort/Ergonomics - OUTSTANDING The best and most comfortable fit of any DSLR I tried.  It FEELS like a quality camera (unlike the Canon DRebelXT/300D-outside North America), and my hand didn't feel cramped like with the Canon. While the Nikon D70 was almost as good in this category, I'd give the Oly E500 a slight edge. Menus and manual controls are well placed and made sense to me. Learning to use the camera was quick and easy.Viewfinder - A weak point for some, but not me. It is a smallish viewfinder compared to the Canon or Nikon.  But as compensation, I felt it worked the best with my eyeglasses.  The exposure and other info is not very bright in the viewfinder and difficult to see, especially in bright light.Image quality with Kit lenses - Very good with lenses stopped down to f/5.6 or f/8 or so.  A little soft with the lenses wide open, but better than the Canon lenses.  Olympus has always had a reputation as one of the best of the Japanese lensmakers and these kit lenses continue to promote that reputation, I think.Image Noise - definitely has noise issues starting at iso 800.  However it is manageable with software like NoiseNinja and such.  Also how many people shoot at iso higher than 400 anyway?  but If you intend to do something where noise is an issue like concert photography or astronomical phototography, this is not the camera for you. for everyone else, 'fugedaboutit!'.Autofocus - about average IMO.  There is no such thing as a GOOD autofocus IMO. Manual focus is pretty good, but the ground glass optical viewscreen really needs a split image for good focus.Exposure seems dead on accurate no complaints whatsoever.  I shoot raw mostly and the only exposure correction I've been doing is for effect only, not to correct any deficiency in exposure.  All the detail is there.Things I wish it had - better remote control or a cable release socket. A bigger viewfinder, the one it has is perfectly acceptable, BUT. . . bigger IS better. Ability to use standard photoflash connectors without a hotshoe connector (for manual and studio flash).  That's pretty much it.  Nothing really major.I'd buy it again.  Especailly at these prices!Update: 2/9/2008  A little guidance for those who wonder if they should still buy the E500 when the E510 is out and the competition has released cameras with 'better' specs.  In my opinion, it is still a viable option for a beginner especially at the close-out prices we are starting to see.The practical difference between 8 and 10 megapixels is pretty small.  And while the E510 has addressed the image noise issue pretty well, many people feel that the E500 still has a slightly better Dynamic Range (the ability to differentiate various shades of gray without being too contrasty or too dull). This can be compensated for by manual adjustements in the E510, but for those who want full auto and are super picky about their photos, that may be more hassle than they want to deal with.The E500 lacks the Image stabilization and live view capabilities of the E510, and while these are nice features to have, I would remind you that people have been taking great photos without them for 200 some odd years. This isn't nearly the handicap that a lack of talent would be!It still takes great photos and it's cheaper than the rest.  It may not be for everyone, but I think it's still worth considering.", "Date": "May 13, 2006"}, {"Title": "What's not to love?", "Author": "R. A Gibson", "ReviewID": "R33UMF2F6CXZCR", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "Olympus got this camera right.  Great 4/3rds sensor takes crisp, beautiful shots edge to edge.  You have beginner options in the umpteen shooting modes available (check out high key and low key, they're wonderful).  You can save to Compactflash AND/OR XD picture card (you're not going to run out of room on a shoot provided the cards are large enough).  You have advanced options like using the Adobe RGB color space.  Menus are intuitive and smart.  Options you'll reference often either have their own button or are at the top of the menu stack.  Autofocus works very well in all but the poorest lighting conditions.  I've taken portraits, landscapes, sports photos, macros, indoor and outdoor and been satisfied with them all.  Olympus's decision to bundle the body with the two lenses (admittedly Zuiko's lower end stuff... the 14-45mm & the 40-150) gets you a setup you can use for nearly every situation from the get go (Note: an affordable 18-180mm has been released, demand is high and everyone has this lens backordered).  You can shoot at varying qualities, but I've grown accustomed to Camera Raw which this camera supports.  RAW gives you so much more flexibility in correcting your shots after the fact.  Battery life is better than point and shoots because the LCD is NOT used to compose the shot.  You use the viewfinder, as is the case with all dSLRs except for the soon to be released E-330 (April 1, 2006).  Bottom line, I've taken 4000 photos with this camera since late November and I don't have a single complaint.  I use the camera 3-4 times a week and I'll confess if something happened to it now, I'd need therapy.  So if you're sitting on the fence about purchasing this camera, you need not be.  Go ahead, spend the rent money (just a joke Moms, no letters please) and have a blast with a great camera.

The Olympus E-500 combined with the FL-50 flash has all the features that anyone, pro or amateur, would want per a high quality digital SLR.  The only feature missing is a Titanium housing, but at this price, you could buy six E-500s before getting into the Titanium market per Digital SLRs.  Olympus has done their homework and provided fast setups for most picture situations one would come across.  So point and shoot, and the camera will do the rest. It is really hard to take a bad picture with this setup!  But they didn't stop there.  Olympus also allows you to modify the quick setups manually per your creative desires per the moment.  So use the quick setups to get on target, then modify it per your special needs.  The camera comes with the lower end Zuikor 14-45mm and 40-150mm lenses.  Not as good as the high-end Zuikor ED lenses, but much better than any point-n-shoot camera. I keep an Olympus SP-350 in the car,  which comes in handy when you rub fenders with another car!  It is also an 8 MegaPixel camera,  but take the same pic with the SP-350 and the E-500, and the quality is definitely noticeable.  The good news. The E-500 is a quality professional camera at a great price.  The bad news. The accessories cost more than the camera! You can spend $6,000 if you want to goto a 300mm Zuikor ED lens (600mm equivalent per a 35mm film camera).  Even the basics are overpriced per Flash Brackets and Sync Cords.  But if you are looking to find a camera to match your creative talent, it is well worth considering the Olympus E-500.  Who am I? I was a wedding photographer for years using Nikons, Hasselblads, and Mamiyas. I also worked with Rocky Gunn in California, considered at the time to be one of the top ten wedding photographers in the USA. Time and decades have passed, and I've moved on to other more profitable endeavors. Still my heart was in still photography.  And for all my years of experience,  I'm hard pressed  to find a major flaw with the E-500.

Williams \"Docoptics\"", "ReviewID": "R2FTFAAJRVOE8E", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I am new to digital SLR photography, but I have a long experience with 35 mm SLRs (Nikon N80, Nikon 6006 most recently).  I decided to go with the Olympus Evolt 500 about 1 month ago based partly on price (I bought the kit with the additional zoom) and on the EVOLT's extensive feature list (I particularly like the ability to shoot blue/purple/green/sepia) and the unique dust reduction system for the sensor.  I was also impressed at the 8 mega-pixels compared to the 6 for the Nikon D50 and D70s, as well as the compact size and light-weight.  I was also disturbed to hear about certain color problems importing Nikon RAW files into Adobe (giving them a slightly bluish hue) because of Nikon's attempt to force people into their software package.  So far the EVOLT has performed very well (at least comparable to my old film N80).  I love the freedom to shoot limitless pictures without concern for running out of film.  Now I am much more selective about printing (which will save me in the long run).Criticisms:--some difficulty shooting in low-light--takes some manipulation of the sub-menus to select film speeds more than 400--the pop-up flash is a poor performer unless you are very close to the subject--it does do a nice job on red-eye reduction--the packaged software is very limited in function--running in manual is possible, but much more complex than it needs to be (why can't camera makers go back to the old simple match needle system?)--view finder a bit cramped--I think it tends to under-expose by a 1/2 stop for my tasteStrengths:--lots of features very suitable for advanced amatures like myself--fairly fast writing--allows you to shoot multiple frames quickly in JPEG without having a delay to stop to write--intelligent design of small details (for instance, in the two lens kit the lens hoods reverse for storage on the lens itself!  Also, the filter size of the two lenses is identicle, reducing cost on filters that can be otherwise pricey)--lacks top LCD panel (this I think is great as it cuts down the size and weight of the camera--with the large LCD on the back who needs the top LCD anyway)--intelligent layout of the controls--they are also not to small like the Canon digital rebel--superior feel to the Canon digital rebel product which is flimsy by comparison, but not the tank like weight and feel of the Nikon D70s--easy ability to shoot high and low-key shots--this is a very nice little program to add and makes formerly tricky exposures much easier--can remember your designated preferences for program mode (for instance I have my program setting for Sepia/children/film speed 400/fill flash)  This allows me to shoot simply in the Auto setting (for point-shoot simplicity), but if I want to quickly switch to my favorite preference I simply switch to program and away I go shooting Sepia--hand-holds extremely well in low-light situationsCameras to compare to include the Canon Digital Rebel and 20D, Nikon D50 and D70.  I am not familiar with the Pentax and Konica-Minolta offerings to comment.  I think this camera offers superior design and lenses to the Canon Rebel without the excessive cost of the 20D.  It offers more creative control and higher Megapixels (and I think better kit lenses) than the Nikon D50 at comparable cost.  The D70s probably has comparable features but at much higher cost/weight and lacks the self-dusting sensor.

Below is a summary of likes and dislikes:- 2.5\" LCD, clear, bright (even in sunlight, just got back from Hawaii so I know)- Relatively fast camera for continuous shots.- Built in modes and scenes provide easy setup for the common situations you might run into (sunsets, candlelight, beach, etc)- Anti dust system works flawlessly- Feels like a SLR Film camera (good when you have big hands)- Good weight- Great battery life- Two lens kit with camera is an excellent value!What I don't like:- Auto-focusing during shots of low light landscapes (e.g. sunsets) using the 40-150mm zoom lens can cause the focusing to become confused- Manual mode adjustments could be a little more straight forward- Lack of USB 2.0 support (get a card reader)- Manual focusing just doesn't feel natural- Position of some controls can cause accidental activation while holding the camera during a shot.- For Olympus: Include the Eyecup Magnifier as a standard feature!- Limited lens selection and vendors (can you say \"EXPENSIVE\")I really like this camera and I feel it was a good choice for me at the time.  However, like technology often does, it changes after you made your purchase!Several vendors released 10-Megapixel camera about three weeks after I made my Olympus purchase all with the Anti-dust system and 2.5\" LCD displays.  I probably would have looked more seriously at the Canon Digital Rebel XT or XTi had the camera not felt so small in my hand (both versions have been rated very high).  Sony and Nikon have some very impressive DSLRs that are reasonably priced.Canon, Sony, and Nikon all have a larger selection of lenses and those lenses are more reasonably priced than Olympus.

Compared directly to the d80, the e500 didn't embarrass itself (which is saying something), and outfitted with the 50mm zuiko prime, takes just as sharp flicks as the Nikon. interestingly, oly's color system favors yellows and greens, while nikon is big on reds and blues. thus, the same shot taken with the e500 and the d80 looked different. this comes down to personal preference, although i believe you can tweak these settings a bit in menu if it's a major concern.the plusses to this camera are:-good-to-excellent picture quality.-full manual controls, plus Aperture, Shutter, and Program modes, and various scene options (landscape, night shot, sports)-bulb setting for long exposures.-SLR-like feel and ergonomics; the E500 looks like a \"real\" SLR, not a toy, and has a nice, solid heft without being too heavy.-a wealth of advanced menu options (which might be overwhelming for newbies).-comes with a 2 lens kit covering 28-300mm film equivalent (due to 2x conversion factor).-more megapixels than nikon d40/d50 (8mp is plenty of pixels for large prints); same MPs as rebel XT (although MPs don't necessarily equal image quality, despite the fact that that's what consumers are led to believe)-takes CF and x-D cards.-has a hot shoe for external flash.-dust reduction system (which nikon lacks).-extremely low noise at ISOs up to 400; has auto ISO feature; can shoot at 1600 ISO if necessary, although you can expect more grain than fine detail at that setting.- 2x conversion factor a boon to telephoto enthusiasts and wildlife shooters, since it effectively doubles your range. pair this with a long telezoom and you'll be seeing the whites of bird's eyes.-if you have manual-focus oly film lenses, a digital adapter is available.-the price. it's already $150 less than what my friend paid six months ago, and the price can only drop further. definitely a deal, considering what you'd spend for a similar body/2-lens kit from other manufacturers.the minuses are:-not as user friendly as nikon d-series; complicated menu means steep learning curve for first-time DSLR users and P&S; converts. reading the manual is a must!!!-average burst rate for a DSLR (Oly claims 2.5 fps, faster than most P&S;'s but not as speedy as the nikon D80 or the canon xt's).-at high ISOs--800 and up--superiority of nikon is evident.-only one jog wheel dial (a sure sign of an entry-level dslr).-many functions require fiddling with menu settings (rather than external controls), which can be frustrating when you're trying to get \"the shot.\"-no image stabilization feature (which pentax and sony have, as well as many high-end P&S; digitals).-built-in flash isn't great (strongly recommend external flash, like Oly FL-36).-kit lenses deliver mediocre low-light performance; the 14-45's aperture is a sloth-like 6.3 on the long end, far worse than the 40-150 which is 5.6 maximum fully zoomed out even though it covers a longer range.-2x mag. factor adversely affects wide-angle capabilities. if you want to go wider than 14mm (28mm film equivalent), you're looking at outlaying  the price of the camera or more for a wide prime or zoom.here's the catch: if you want comparable DSLR performance from the oly, you'll have to pay a pretty penny for higher-quality lenses, which really depends on your faith in oly's 4/3rds system, which it shares with panasonic and leica. at first, the 4/3rds selection was sparse, but as of 3/10/2007, olympus has just announced several new zuiko zoom lenses to go with their aftermarket offerings: a 12-60 (24-120 equiv.), 50-200 (100-400 equiv)and 14-35 (28-70 equiv.), all with an ultra-quiet motor oly calls \"SWD\" (basically serves the same function as sigma's USM or nikon's SWM) and a 70-300 (140-600 (!) equiv.). this shows they are serious about playing in the dslr arena and should inspire confidence among entry-level users that oly's commited to its product line. these new lenses aren't cheap, but with wider apertures (as wide as f/2.0) and quick internal motors, they could rival canon and nikon's offerings. there's still no IS/VR equivalent offered, but the pot just got sweeter, especialy for those who don't want to jump on the canikon bandwagon.lens options aside, the E500 is aimed more at the casual user who wants to look like a pro without spending pro dough. More to the point, to really unlock the full potential of this camera, you're going to have to take some time really learning the functions (and maybe researching terms like aperture, shutter speed, and iso). and of course, by the time you figure out the manual, there will probably be a lot more lenses available. for a P&S; user who wants to take exhibition-quality shots right out of the box without having to adjust every setting, this isn't the camera for you (that camera may not exist). For a film shooter converting to DSLR, the E500 will deliver adequate-to-very good performance without breaking the bank.for the majority of users who want a high-quality, if not super high-end, camera, with some flexibility as far as options, at a value price, the E500 deserves a long look. However, if budget is your primary concern, i'd also check out some fixed-lens superzooms, like the Canon S3 IS Pro (6mp/12x zoom), and the Panasonic DMC FZ50 (10mp/12x zoom), which both have image stabilization, deliver near-DSLR performance, and have most (but not all) of the same functionality as the E500 at a lower price -- hundreds less, in fact. But if faster frames per second rates and having options like super wide-angle, long telephoto, and lower aperture numbers appeals to you, then you'll want to go DSLR.if you do get this camera, make sure you get at least a 2GB card with a fast writing speed, which will improve performance and decrease lag time between shots. also, if you have the loot, definitely consider buying the body only, and starting off with one or two of the premium lenses. with the 12-60 and the 70-300, for instance, it's possible to cover a focal range from 24-600 with only two lenses.", "Date": "March 12, 2007"}, {"Title": "Best deal", "Author": "owookiee \"owookiee\"", "ReviewID": "R2YWRL50PV8JPY", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I'd been scoping out digital SLRs for a while, reading up extensively on the technical reviews, and finally chose the Olympus E500 over the equivalent Nikon and Canon.

Battery life has been awesome, even with lots of flash and LCD reviewing.There's two things I would change about it:Autofocus in low light - you can use the annoying strobe flash to aid it, but otherwise it doesn't focus well, which surprises me because my Olympus C-60 has no issue with this.Lack of a \"Supermacro\" - this is understandable as you can get a macro lens for it, but again, the lesser model C-60 has this feature built in, and so if I need to get a super close shot, I revert back to my C-60!", "Date": "February 25, 2006"}, {"Title": "Very happy with my purchase", "Author": "John Klopp", "ReviewID": "R2A86WQGBCJBK7", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "As an amateur photographer who has used a conventional film SLR (Olympus OM-1) for years and transitioned to digital with a lesser camera before purchasing the EVOLT E500 kit, I think I made the right choice.

I was concerned about it before seeing the camera, but as soon as I started taking pictures I realized it was not an issue.  I wear glasses most of the time and it is not a problem.  It can be difficult in brighter lighting to see the information to the right of the image in the viewfinder, though.I find the menu system, particularly the ability to jump quickly into any part of it via the viewing screen, to be well done.  There are several pathways available to changing settings.The kit lenses are only so-so.  Not long after I bought the kit, I upgraded to the 14-54 and 50-200 lenses, which are truly excellent.  Probably should have bought the body only and gone straight to these lenses.The auto white-balance button is easy to press accidentally while taking a hurried action shot.  It just takes a bit of practice to avoid doing it.The USB 1.1 means relatively slow transfer of images off the card, but I consider that a minor annoyance.The LCD screen on back is superb.In theory, at least, the automatic dust reduction system is a great feature.Summary:I have no second thoughts about this purchase.

I've never seen a speck of dust in a shot, and I laugh at Canon / Nikon users when I see them swabbing off ther sensors--Kit lenses about as good as you can expect kit lenses to be--Good power-on and shot-to-shot times--Excellent menu system that (despite some reviews to the contrary) put every setting you could ever expect to change during a shoot at your fingertips--Very good ergonomics - it won't slip out of your hand, and is comfortable to hold (unlike, say, the Rebel XT), has a good weight, and has all the buttons exactly where your fingers expect them to beOf course, it's not perfect, and for less than $1000 (including two lenses!) you can't expect to get a pro-level camera, but I think it hit the balance of features and cost very nicely. The autofocus can be a little sluggish in low light, especially if you've turned off the AF illuminator (which has a tendency to annoy people). The buffer could be bigger - shooting in RAW, you can take about 4 pictures before you need to release the shutter and start again. Noise gets pretty high above ISO 1000, but not many people use such fast speeds too often, and it's no worse than the grain on a decent ISO 400 film, and it's not so bad that Noise Ninja can't make it go away, so it's not an issue.I think I've taken about 20,000 pictures with this camera, and I've never had a problem with it.

Kreis \"livedeadcat\"", "ReviewID": "R3D72RH1S6N2VW", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "In my opinion, the Olympus E-500 is perhaps the best camera available this season for the serious student of digital photography. It has a rich feature set that provides a student with the full range of adjustments to address most situations a student is likely to encounter. The price of the two-lens kit brings it within the means of all but the most cash-strapped of starving students.  This camera and the academic version of Photoshop should more than accommodate whatever photo projects a student is likely to undertake, excluding underwater and severe weather situations.The E-500 is a sturdy camera, plastic bodied but with a metal internal frame; it should stand up to some abuse.  Students will appreciate the Control Panel LCD, which provides quick access to almost all camera settings. Playback modes include separate histograms for R-G-B and luminance, and clipping indicators for highlights and shadows. File capture options include several compression levels of JPEG, 8-bit TIFF and 12-bit raw (ORF). The kit lenses are not the world's best, but they are certainly competent, capable of producing results that should pass muster for all but the most critical student eye.For students, I think the main limitations of the E-500 include a small viewfinder that makes manual focus a chore and the lack of a wired remote.  Rumors of noise at high ISO settings and slow multi-exposure performance may be true, but should not be a problem for most students.I think students should be careful not to spend too much money on camera equipment at this point in their careers.  True, more money buys better optics, higher performance and better build quality, but that should be viewed in the light of the rapid obsolescence cycles experienced by today's cameras.  Digital cameras should be regarded as little more than computer peripherals, subject to the same rapid technological advances experienced by all computer gear. Why should a student want to spend extra for a fancy camera that will be superceded next season and be obsolete in three seasons?  The premium a student would pay for a higher-tone camera might better be spent on a digitizing tablet (Wacom Intuos3 6x8) or a good TTL flash unit (Olympus FL-36).  I advise students to wait on the high-end gear until they can take it off their taxes as a business expense.Students who drive Porsches to school may disregard all of the above.", "Date": "July 27, 2006"}, {"Title": "Get the camera.

The camera is great, bla bla bla.  I think everyone's already beaten that horse to death. Plenty of reviews here on how great the camera is, and I agree with them.  But I have to say, compared to the other lenses made for the e500 (and other e-system DLSRs), these kit lenses are pretty bad.  The kit lenses are a great starter.  And they're worlds better than anything you'll get with a point-and-shoot.  But having replaced  both of these lenses with better ones, I regret spending the money on the kit initially.  I feel I should have just bought the body, and a separate lens (the 14-54 NON KIT lens is freakin' amazing!).  That's my advice to you.  Definitely get this camera.  The image quality is on par with similar offerings from Nikon and Canon, and it has the same, or very similar features.  But if I were you I'd get the e500 body ONLY rather than the kit.  Buy the body, buy a good lens separately.  Yeah, you'll pay a little more, but the quality you'll get will be worth it.  Especially if you think you may upgrade your lens later on anyway.  Trust me.  Spend a little more now, and it'll literally save you about $200 later.Buying a DSLR means buying into that maker's lens system. You're not just buying an e500 here, you're also buying into Olympus's lens system.  And that's a very good system to buy into.  Olympus Zuiko lenses are incredible, both in the image quality they give you, as well as their performance.As far as lenses go, I'd suggest you buy--seperately--the 14-54 Zuiko lens (Olympus 14-54mm f/2.8-3.5 Zuiko ED Digital SLR Lens for E1, E300 & E500 Cameras).  Careful not to confuse it with the 14-45 lens that comes with the kit.  It's not the same lens at all, and not at all in the same class.The 18-150mm lens may sound tempting, but don't bother with it.  It's of the same build quality, and has the same image quality and performance as the kit lens.

I have a 2.5 year old E1, the first of their 4/3rds DSLR cameras. I have Zuiko 50-200mm, 300mm, 18-45mm and several other lenses. I bought the E500 body to get more pixels: the E1 has only 5.5 megapixels and for the kind of work I do, that's just not enough.The E500 has a slightly less \"professional\" feature set than the E1, but adds many features that the older E1 doesn't have, including 25 (!) exposure modes and a digital viewing screen on the back that is bright, crisp and a true joy to use. You will want to download the firmware updates promptly on purchase; they help a lot with auto focus and exposures in low light conditions. But except for the firmware update, this is a fine camera out of the box.Pluses: The Kodak KAF-8300CE CCD sensor does a very nice, even exceptional job with colors and tones, and when you keep it at or below ISO 800 there is very little noise even in poor light conditions. The dust removal system introduced with the E1 works as well or better than ever. As I watch my buddies struggle with dust on the CCD sensor with each lens change, I appreciate even more the Olympus dust removal technology. It really works, and is a tremendous timesaver in the field. Finally, the camera is sturdy, ergonomic and the primary controls are convenient.Minuses: unlike the E1, it doesn't have a \"firewire\" port and the single port it has seems to be USB-1, not USB-2. It takes a long time to download photos shot in RAW/SHQ. The solution is to get a card reader instead. The 25 pre-defined shooting modes are simply too many. I shoot mostly in MF/MEx anyway, but I suspect it would take longer to select a suitable \"mode\" than to manually focus and set your exposure.Overall, though, this is an excellent camera and works well with all of the Zuiko lenses.

(The 6MP Pentax D100 was in the running, too.) Finally, I pretty much decided that based on the reviews for the E500, it seemed like people who know their way around SLR cameras enjoyed it, whereas the complaints mostly seemed to be lack of ease by those coming from the P&S; camp. That being said, Olympus does make fine cameras. So does Canon. So does Nikon. As I saw it, it's pretty much like the old Ford verus Chevy debate: just as many people can tell you why one is superior to the other. When it comes down to it, all cameras (like all cars) have their stong points and their weak points. And depending on what you're using a camera for, different aspects will weigh more heavily than others.For instance, for me, price was a big concern. This is, hands down, the best deal. I picked up a factory demo refurbished 2-lens kit. I don't think I can list the price in the review, but it was the cheapest among the 8MP cameras. And the two lenses are both made-for-digital. Somewhat limited by Olympus' 4/3 platform, but any camera you buy if you want good glass in front of it, you'll be spending as much as the body. Or more. Top of the line lenses are not cheap... anywhere, from any maker. These Zuiko lenses seem solid though, and I can't complain about them. I do wish there were more AF options versus what basically amounts to a center-focus option only. There are 3, but they're very close to the center. Minor irritation, though; just focus on your subject, hold the shutter down halfway, and then frame your shot. Really no different than lining up those two circles on older 35mm lenses.I like the overall ergonomics of the camera. It's just big enough that it has some heft, but not too heavy to weigh you down. (Granted, I'm a 6'1\" guy with average-sized hands.) However, it does feel a little plasticy, but coming from a Pentax K-1000, I think anything will. And having worked at a photography-based company in the recent past, I got a little spoiled on the Nikon D1 series; however, the D50 (and to a lesser extent the D70) felt more like a toy. But the E500 fits in my hands nicely. I actually really like the way the lens sits almost all the way over to one side, with an ample grip on the opposite. Makes for strong handling on vertical shots, even one-handed.Photos are great. Very sharp, very crisp. Colors have a nice vibrancy. Tones are balanced. I've seen a few complaints about noise in higher ISOs, but I didn't see anything too out of line. Plus, there's noise reduction, which takes it down to pretty much nil. Anything that's left, nothing a basic photo-editing program can't take care of in a second. I think the \"blur\" complaints are from people used to P&S; photography. I've shot down to 1/15 or so with no more blur than expected. It's just a matter of knowing how to hold a camera and maintain a firm stance. As someone who loves black-and-white shooting, the color filters for the momochrome mode are a nice touch. They can really make the images pop. I've been happy with the all the settings; it has lots of scene modes, lots of little ways to tweak the images as you shoot, too (high key/low key, vivid, muted, etc). The flash sits up a little higher than other cameras, too, so there's less of a chance of catching shadow on closer shots. The flash can be a little bright and slightly distracting when in auto-focus focus-finding (pre-flash). Again, though, not a huge deal.Now the menu IS a little convoluted. It could be more user-friendly and intuitive. But it's nothing that a reasonably adept photographer can't figure out after reading the manual and playing around a little bit. A second command wheel would be nice, but hey, you're here for an economical camera, and you're going to have to cut a few corners, I guess. All the commands of a second wheel are there, just back in the menu. Some way to set \"hot buttons\" or something could compensate some, too, but again... think value.My only other \"complaint,\" which is more of just a minor annoyance than anything, is the location of the power swith and the rear dial for adjusting aperture and/or shutter speed. Sometimes when changing settings, I'll trip the power and turn it off. Startup is quick, though, so it's not a biggie. And sometime when repositioning myself and moving the camera around, I'll inadvertently change the aperture or shutter (depending on which mode I'm shooting in). Either moving it more to the top, making it harder to turn, or making some sort of setting \"lock\" would help.Anyway, bottom line: if you're a 35mm SLR user wanting to make the switch to digital, and price is a deciding factor, just go ahead and get this camera. It's a solid camera that takes great pictures, and is likely just as good as any of the other--more expensive--options. If you're impatient and just want a better point-and-shoot, get another point and shoot.

Like all dslrs it's very easy to take a bad picture with this camera, but with a little practice the results are far better than point and shoots.The only draw back I would say is the cost of Zuiko lenses.

This being my first SLR I was a little worried about understanding all of the settings that are available. I was pleasantly surprised to see that when using the auto settings it does a very good job at taking pictures equal to or better than my point and shoot. The greatest part about this is that now I can work on learning all of the more advanced features yet still switch back to Auto mode when I need to take a quick picture. So far almost all of the dials and menus are very straight forward. If you are experienced using a point and shoot that was made in the last few years then this camera should be a breeze to pick up and use. I haven't opened the manual yet and I still have managed to play with most of the settings and not render it inoperable. I think this is a very good camera for someone wanting to try their hand at more professional photography. As a side note I noticed this camera got a bad review for not being a Nikon or Canon.

I imagine that you'll be very satisfied for paying the difference.8MP with 2 pretty good kit lenses for under $650 as of 4/2007, and an upgrade path to the E-510 for all the lenses and accessories. Once you make that upgrade, what's left to ask for except a faster burst mode and weather sealing. That's 10MP, IS in-body, SSWF and live-view.IMHO, even if you're an \"entry-level\" DSLR user, spend the extra $400+ and get the faster 14-54mm f2.8-3.5 lens and get rid of the the 14-45mm f3.5-5.6 lens. The 40-150mm f3.5-4.5 is a very nice lens, with no real peers in the entry-level DSLR range as a kit lens that I could see without going 3rd party. This lens put Olympus over the edge for me. For that speed of lens over that 35mm equivalent range (28-300mm), I'm not sure what else can compete on price.If you have to have a faster lens for the longer zoom, you could cough up the $800+ for the 50-200mm f2.8-3.5, and even then, that's a very, very good price for that kind of lens and 35mm equivalent range.The camera has full manual controls, as expected from a DSLR, and can drive a newbie like me nuts, but can also keep it simple with it's auto mode and numerous scene settings (which I use a good deal).If you get this camera, IMHO, don't bother with the xD cards. They are very slow in comparison to the less expensive CF cards in this camera.When it comes time to get a flash, go the extra mile and get the Olympus FL-36 over the FL-20. I'm not sure that the FL-50's warranted at this price point. I was lucky to find one cheap, so I didn't have to research 3rd party flashes.I confess to having been a pixel-peeper and compared the high-ISO samples from this camera to the Canons and Nikons of the world. It's definitely not bad in direct comparison, but after you're done resizing and touching up the photos, you'll never notice, IMHO.

The Amazon price for this camera body and two lens kit is simply the best price to be found anywhere, and is less than most vendors charge for this camera with a single lens.  No longer do I mourn the loss of my Nikon 8008s 35mm Film Camera.Both lenes have outstanding optics and the metering system is superb.  The included lens hoods are very helpful, but make sure you take them off for flash photography.  The lenses operate quietly and quickly.  They have nice grip.The built-in pop up flash is adequate for close-up snap shots, but you'll want one of the two available dedicated flash units the FL-36 or FL-50.  Don't waste your time or money with the FL-20.  I bought the FL-36, which is a full featured dedicated flash with significant manual overrides just as with the camera to meet your creative needs.  I'm likely to further upgrade to the FL-50 which is a more powerful full professional grade flash.For serious photographers, this camera gives you total manual control that provides overrides for every possible setting to ensure you realize your full creative needs (just as with any professional 35mm or digital SLR).The automatic settings for focus and exposure are outstanding as well.  There are several program modes for various types of shooting and a user program mode where you can essentially make your specific manual settings an automatic set-up.The controls are well placed, except for the the one-touch White Balance and the Auto-Focus frame buttons are right where you may normally want to place your right thumb while holding the camera, especially if you're taking vertical shots.  The large LCD display is excellent and easy to read even in bright light, but be advised that its not for composing and lining up your pictures.  The display is for making your camera settings and viewing the pictures you've taken.  You must compose your shots through the viewfinder only.  The viewfinder gives you gives you plenty of camera setting information along with immediate exposure and composition feedback so you can make adjustments without removing your eye from the viewfinder.The camera shoots in every file format that complete amatuers want and serious professional photographers need ranging from various degrees of quality for jpeg all the way up to TIFF and several RAW settings.  The has shutter speeds that go from manual settings up to 1/4000th and an ISO range up to 1600.The camera is built solid, is very well balanced and lightweight.  It looks great and feels great with a nice grip.  The included Olympus LBH-1 battery has extraordinary life.  I had in the camera for the first 3 months without a change or charge.  In that time I took over 600 pictures, and often found that I had left the camera on when I went to pull it out of my bag for the next shoot.  In fact, during my trip to Ireland during this mentioned timeframe. I basically left the camera on night and day for an entire week and had juice to spare when I got home.  Phenominal!As mentioned the included lenses with this kit (wide angel to normal & normal to long telephoto) are very, very good.  I'm so pleased with the overall performance and capabilities of the camera itself, that I'm definitely going to invest heavily in the professional level lens upgrades.  With the exception of the Macro and extreme wide angle, those lenses are essentially the same focal lengths as included with this camera kit.  However the upgrades are \"faster\" lenses allowing for more very low light levels and a greater ability to capture sports activity.Bottomline, this camera is fantastic and has everything that far more expensive professional cameras have.

I stuck with my trusty pentax K1000 and various Nikons over the years because i was a 'film guy.'  I even went out and bought a professional-grade film scanner and developing equipment so that I could stay a 'film guy' well into the future.  That was until I really scrutinized the photos, which, no matter how carefully I developed and scanned, all had a grainy look to them.  I realized that technology had finally caught up with me, and I needed to get with the program and buy a digital camera.  I'm only a hobbyist, not a professional, but I insisted on an SLR to avoid parallax problems.  All my cameras save one were SLR's of 1970's vintage.  The problem was that the fine cameras in the Nikon and Canon lines were way to pricy for my budget and hard to justify for amateur use; I was almost resigned to one of those consumer-grade units with the built-in non-interchangable lenses until I came upon this camera.  The package came with a body, a 14 to 45 mm zoom, a 40-150 mm zoom, a battery charger and battery, and various wires and software.  I took the camera on a day trip and used it mostly in \"Auto\" (easy) mode, and was instantly impressed with the quality of the pictures, especially their sharpness.

It has all sorts of programed exposure settings, plus aperture and shutter priority, as well as fully manual exposure.  Bottom line: I think this is the PERFECT camera for serious and semi-serious use, or for anyone who doesn't mind a little extra bulk and weight in order to have great pictures (it is not tiny, it's about the size of a standard 35mm SLR).  I wish the lenses were a bit faster; they are both only f/3.5, but that's quibbling.  Extra lenses are available, in three grades from Olympus but some of them are VERY pricy.

If you want a digital SLR, there is not a better value out there. This camera comes out of the box with 2 fully digital lenses. It has a ton of features and a pretty large display. I found it very easy to use in point and shoot mode. It took about 5 minutes to look through the quick start guide to get it set up that way and start shooting. For those that are more serious, it has a ton of different options for white balance, exposure settings, etc.. Those will definitely require more time investment to master. The E500 also has multiple image quality modes, so you can easily adjust for picture size and amount of detail you need.It takes excellent photos, and while a professional might be able to spot the differences at higher ISO settings, 1. you probably won't be using it at those extremes, and 2. you also won't notice any degradation. Even at the highest settings, the camera still produces excellent shots suitable for 8 x 10 printed pictures. Any noise you might see in the shots (again, rare) can be pretty easily handled by most graphics software.There might be a better camera out there, like the Canon EOS Digital Rebel XTi, but you will pay a lot more for it and you won't get any lenses. (A decent lens costs more than the camera.) I would also be amazed if you noticed any difference in picture quality, even though it has a higher megapixel rating. The E500 comes with two digital lenses that will handle just about any shots you're going to want to take. Olympus also has a whole family of digital lenses avialable if you are more serious about your photos or if you need something that the included lenses don't cover (extreme close up or miles away).Olympus includes decent photo capture software for PC or Mac, but I'd recommend something like Paint Shop Pro or another package. Other notes: The battery charge lasts a reasonable amount of time and the camera comes with USB and other video cables.

We used the pictures from this camera to put together a slide show for a week-long camp trip with junior high age kids. Everyone was well-impressed by the pictures this camera takes. The only disappointment I've found, and it isn't important to me, is that you have to use the viewfinder to take your picture, as the image does not appear on the screen on the back of the camera. Be sure to purchase a memory card when you purchase the camera or you won't be able to take any pictures. I missed that somewhere and had to quickly order a memory card before I left on the trip.

I have to say that the idea of buying a camera of this magnitude was daunting from the standpoint of all the terminology I would have to learn to better use the unit. The documentation takes care of that and is easy to understand. The on screen menu on the very large LCD is easy to use. The two lenses that came with the camera are the basic package where photographing small and large objects close and far away are concerned. Its really all here except it didn't come with a memory card, which I found not to be a big deal, because the capacity will largely be matter of personal preference. I opted for an 8.0 GB card with is more than adequate for capturing over 3000 images. The 8.1 Megapixel clarity is more than I've ever had in the way of a camera so maybe I'm just a bit dazzled right now, but the first photos I took for some product shots were clear beyond anything I've seen yet. All in all, with the combination of taking a digital photography class to better get most out of the unit, I would have to say this was positive experience. One would have to be a total pro looking for subtle nuances in a camera to not be happy with this camera.

I am the individual in my family who is always taking pictures and video and I absolutely love it.  I was previously a point and shoot user and have always owned Cannon Digital Cameras.  Canon Powershot A85 and most recently the Cannon Powershot S3.  We have an olympus point and shoot digital camera at work and it takes some good photos.Now what I like about this camera.. I love the large 2.5 display, I never got that with cannon.. althought the did have the rotating display which Iloved.  Actually this camera had been pretty user friendly for the most part.  I highly recommend contacting your local camera shop to see if they offer a class on how to use the camera.  It will be extremely helpful.  I also like the fact that you can do some editing right on the camera.If you are going to purchase this camera, be sure to purchase it with the lense kit.. If you try to purchase the same lenses separate you will end up spending upwards of $400.If you are new to DSLR, here is a few things you should know.  First,  you will not be able to see your photos on your LCD as you would with your other digital cameras.  Second, you can't take video.  Also, go to the Olympus website, they have various manuals written about the camera and how to get the most out of it.. This was very helpful.Overall, I think this is a camera you can grow with whether you are a beginner or a novice photographer..UPDATE 5/2/07I still love the camera; however, as with anything you can find a few flaws.  If you are in a extremely low light situation, the flash on the camera doesnt do well.  Purchasing the FL-36 Flash helped greatly and there are also some free olympus software upgrades that can be done.  Overall, I still feel it was the best value for the money..6/20/2007UPDATEI have enrolled in photography class and I love this camera.  It may not be the top of the line but it is definitely a workhorse.  The battery life for taking pictures is awesome.  Some recommendations1.  When purchasing a memory card, purchase the CF, it is the cheapest and the fasted.  The XD is ok, but you why spend the extra money2.  Get no less than a 1G card the preferrence is 2G3.  Forget hooking your camera up to your PC to download pictures, purchase a memory card reader.. don't drain your battery This camera has taken some great pictures and the two lens kit is awesome I have used the 14mm-145mm for some great macro shots in combination with the macro feature on the camera.Now here is one thing I don't like... the more I get into photgraphy and I learn about shutter speeds etc etc.. it would have been nice if Olympus had put the disply for reading this on top of the camera rather than having to look through the view finder.... but this is so small when you think of the overall vallue of this camera.Enjoy7/1/07 UpdateThis camera is really good.  I must say that I am in a photography class where the majority of the people have Nikon or Cannon and My photographs are just as good if not better.One of the things I have come to absolutely love is the dual memory slots...  One of the things I don't like is that you can't  use a \"cable release\" with this camera, you have to use the remote control which has to be pointed at the front of the camera.  The remote is a must for portrait photgraphy and in situations like photographing the moon or fireworks so you can avoid camera shake.", "Date": "April 30, 2007"}, {"Title": "Incredible buy!", "Author": "Eric M.

Plus having lost a `sealed' compact to dust on the sensor the Olympus vibrational dust removal CCD system is great idea. Basically the camera feels like a traditional SLR, holds very well, and is relatively easy to use, although many useful things (and there are a lot of them for your money) are hidden in the various menus (like ASA's above 800 needing an on/off to activate). See the independent site dpreview.com for an excellent review of this camera and it's main digital SLR competitors available on Amazon. Picture quality is very good, although a bit noisy above 400 ASA. Having to swap lenses to get more than 3x zoom is also a bit of a pain (especially on a windy beach). I have got used to a 12x zoom compact, and I tend to leave the telephoto at home as the camera bag is rather weighty with it stashed in. Naturally you need to get a generic second battery (although the supplied battery is good for few days intensive shooting). Like all SLR's the excellent back LCD screen is at very high risk of damage from face contact and scratches so I applied a [PALM branded] screen protector before use.The only downside is the painfully slow USB 1 (not 2) transfer speed (up to twenty minutes for a days shoot), no top notch autofocus (up to three focus areas not five) and the irritation of no distance markings on the manual focus ring. So when you try to use manual focus in the dark you find it virtually impossible to set focus manually, whereas you could easily twist to say 3m or infinity on the lens ring if it was there (or shown in the menu). The focus ring just spins round and round and you don't even know which way the focus is going - this will protect the focus motor though. There's also no focussing light aid other than the short range flash. Having to use the pop-up flash to focus in the dark is also a real pain unless your wish to dazzle the subject - I never use it and switch off the auto pop-up and flash focus aid, the camera focuses far better without it anyway. It also tends to overexpose a little and you often forget to compensate after it returns to default (if you stay on Auto it does remember settings though). The image quality is also rather noisy above 400 ASA, compared to the main opposition - and unfortunately I now find I use 800-1600 ASA quite a bit. Plus you have to pay a small charge to upgrade the basic supplied Olympus Master software to the excellent Pro version. If you can live with the downsides, the camera has a lot to recommend it. I couldn't find any SLR for the price that had everything I wanted, and this SLR offered a good compromise. It has so many features that I'm still discovering some.

Very good picture quality, good lenses, decent manual (considering the complexity of digital SLRs, a good manual is a necessity) and light weight.My one complaint is the lack of a usable remote trigger.

Make sure you have a card on hand. Or two.And also, while using the camera in AUTO mode, where the light is dim enough that a flash is needed, the flash can be VERY irritating. As the camera adjusts itself for the photo, it often performs several test flashes, meaning that taking an indoor picture on auto can actually take up to ten seconds - and multiple flashes that thoroughly blind your victim before the photo is actually taken. This is irritating.I have not used the included software, so I cannot comment on it.

I will save up for the 70 - 300 Olympus zoom for later.That lens is about $400.00.In the meantime, I am disappointed that Tamron or Tokina do not make lenses for the Olympus 4/3 system. Even Sigmaonly seems to have a few affordable choices.  Laslty,  Olympus seems to be totally focused on the Micro 4/3rds systems and seems be abandoning this 4/3 normal system.  When I search for adapters, they are almost all for the Micro cameras.I have found adapters that allow me to work with Olympus OM lenses and NIkon lenses.  This has expanded mylens choices, but with the loss of auto-focus.

When I first took this camera out of the box I found it more then a little intimidating.The instruction manual is the size of a small novel (presented in three languages) and frankly....three years after purchasing the camera I still haven't learned every single little thing about it. Digital SLR's are a very very different animal from what I'd been used to. After you insert your flash memory card your off to the races and all you have to do is....figure out all the complex technicalities of SLR photography. Of course with a few days practice you will get incredible photographs with this,especially if you had a lot of knowledge beforehand about photography as I did.At present there are 12 megapixel cameras out there but,even now the resolution on this 8 megapixel model is absolutely stunning. It's definately a professional camera and has all kinds of sophisticated features.One of my favorites on this is the motor drive.It's a bit tough to use this setting with the built in flash but in proper conditions it is an excellent feature for any kind of action photography.This camera also has a number of amazing lighting and and picture options.You can choose from a number of ISO speeds but,of course keep in mind that as with 35MM the higher an ISO speed you choose,the coarser and grainer the finished product is likely to appear,especially when printed on huge paper. But this camera does offer all the great features of a semi-automatic 35 mm SLR and two excellent lenses.One word of note:you'll probably require a longer range flash attachment for the 80-200 telephoto zoom lens included but in terms of outdoor work it really does bring in far images closer and clearer,with not too bad f-stops too.Other great lighting features are a handful of flash options,even for outdoor \"fill\" flash use and even on the automatic setting the use of exposure compensation to lighten or darken your general image. There is a manual setting which allows you full control but even I admit I rarely use it:the manual shutter/F-stop settings are controlled with tiny buttons that are hard to sync up and,while a built in light meter is included for this situation it's somewhat more time consuming.So recommended setting on this camera for the impatient subject?From my experience that would be the auto close up (or portrait) setting with the motor drive swiched on,with the use of flash indoors or natural light outside for the best effect.So with a little practice with it's complex modes and a little time this camera will delivery the best pictures you can probably imagine.", "Date": "June 16, 2009"}, {"Title": "My-Mode for HDR, and Silver body to keep it cool in the sun!", "Author": "Rolf Bertram \"RolfBertramDotCom\"", "ReviewID": "R2FXC2HWDCF615", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "The my-mode button helps in HDR by allowing to recall a user defined setting of, for example aperture and exposure time in manual mode.

I have a E300 with over 20k shots on it, and it still looks like brand new. There seems to be a problem with the black E500 housing surface.

Bhattacharya", "ReviewID": "R12H59MS18RFBX", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "The Olympus EVOLT 500 is the best representative of a line of amazing DSLRs which have the potential to unseat Nikon and Canon as the premier market leaders. The E500 is simply loaded with features, but let me point out why you need to buy this right now.1. Simple controls. The E500 has a great design philosophy: the standard metaphor for doing anything on this camera is `press a button and rotate the control wheel'. Controls such as ISO, WB, AF and metering are mounted on the 4-way key located on the right of the large 2.5'' screen. I prefer to maintain Single AF, unless, of course, I am photographing something moving really fast, like birds. I keep the screen switched off to conserve battery; every time I activate one of the 4-way keys, like ISO, the screen lights up with only the ISO displayed. Very efficient.2. Fast and efficient AF. People are known to crib about just 3 AF points, but I don't see why. If I am ever photographing under really tricky light conditions, I tend to use spot metering with the central AF point. Sure, the EOS30D has 9 AF points, but it weighs a tonne and costs  as much as a Ferrari. The continuous AF is quite nice, but beware: don't use it when you don't need to. I was once photographing turtles in a marsh, and my AF kept throwing me off, it was only later that I realized that at maximum focal length, continuous AF can be easily fooled by surrounding reeds which are practically invisible to you (at 140 mm).3. Easy metering. You can under/over expose to within 0.3 stops (or EVs). This is easily accomplished by holding down the exposure compensation button and rotating the wheel. You can also change the step size in metering to 0.7 stops or 1 stop.4. The screen is nice and bright, and can spew out much more data than you need. Fortunately, it also has a basic mode, with only essential mode data displayed. My favourite mode for the screen is to keep it off. Saves battery power.5. The menu is much more readable than on, say the Rebel Tx. I sometimes need to switch to monochrome, and this is easily done. I would have liked a hotkey for this, but well..6. Small viewfinder. Apparently Olympus sells an eyecup magnifier. Why can't they include it in the kit? Oh, profits..7. Reasonably fast operations. This is not a professional camera. Don't expect EOS30D or D200 level work, but there is no shutter lag, and as I found out during a dolphin show, the speed factor is going to be your reflexes and not that of the camera.8. Excellent battery. Takes forever to charge, though. Good for 500 pictures, which is about what you can fit into a 2GB CF card. Remember to switch off the screen.9. The onboard flash is awful. But all onboard flashes are awful, so nothing new there. I always shoot in ambient light anyway.10. Kit lenses. The Zuiko lens lineup is truly impressive, and very costly too. I would like the 18-180 mm lens to be a little cheaper. I really hate it when I am shooting people pictures with the 40-150 mm outside in the street, and then I want to take  pictures of buildings and then I have to go to a Starbucks and switch to the 14-45 lens. The 18-180 mm would be the perfect walkabout lens, except that it is rather costly. Oh, it would be soooo nice if the Sigma 70-300 mm lens was available on a 4/3rd  mount. Hey, people at Sigma, Tamron, Tokina.. listen up... we need some decent third party 4/3rd mount lenses... please?11. Ok, bad points. There should be a DC power connection and adapter for transferring pictures, or displaying them on a TV.12. Really bad point. USB 1.1!!!!! What the bleep???? Pictures take FOREVER AND AN HOUR to transfer. I could finish my PhD by the time the contents of a 2 GB card make their way to my computer. Well, not really, otherwise I would have graduated....Summary: this is a great camera with an good pedigree and an ever expanding range of lenses and upgrades available.

The price I paid in the end for the camera and two lenses is unbeatable. I wrote paid in the end because the price dropped twice after I received it, I called Amazon and they refunded the difference. Thank You AmazonFirst let me say I'm old school; I was using a totally manual camera up until now, but decided to jump on the DSLR wagon when I was using my wife's point and shoot digital camera for some candid shots. I liked being able to immediately download and have my pictures.  I'm not rich and had limited funds to make this jump. None of my old lenses are auto focus so there was nothing to tie me down to a brand name, and am not brand loyal I have owned Nikon, Pentex and if anyone remembers Practica brand names. I looked at the market and looked at cameras. There are many cameras in the price range of the E-500 and many that are way above it. In the end, dollar for dollar the Olympus won out. The automatic sensor cleaning technology is a must, and the kit lenses have been reviewed to be much better quality than other brand camera kit lenses.  And two lenses give me a jump on my new set up. [...].The camera works great, take good pictures. I took pictures of my kids at a band concert, the school did not turn on the spot lights so there was a low light problem to face. I shot the pictures on ISO 1600 and yes there was some noise as expected but it works like it should. My hand shaking was the problem. Olympus just came out with the Evolt E510 which adds ant-shake but also cost two hundred and fifty dollars more.

I have had an Olympus C-2100UZ for about 5 years and it has been a great camera, but I was ready to upgrade to a true digital SLR.  I have had very good 35mm SLR cameras for a couple decades and been a serious armature photographer.This camera disappointed me.  It sure has an amazing number of features packed into it, but in the end a good camera boils down to photo quality, period, and the photo quality I get from this camera is not as good as I get from my C-2100UZ (a long ago deprecated 2MP model).The E-500 does best outside with bright light, but inside it has serious focus and exposure problems.  The photo quality is more on par with an old 110mm camera, or a Polaroid.  They are just not at all crisp and clear as you would expect from a camera of this caliber.  The photos are either grainy or out of focus.  It uses the flash to create light for the auto-focus in low-light scenarios, which drives human subjects insane, and must just not really work very well.  I tried manual focus too and still it just doesn't take clear pictures inside.Most professional reviews (e.g. PC Magazine) seem to echo the same...that this camera is okay, but just not quire there yet.I returned this one and ordered a Nikon D50.  A lot more 3rd party lens options are available for it because it's built on existing standards.  Maybe the problem with the E-500 is the new \"four thirds\" lens system...and if so maybe they will eventually get that right, but for now, and for this kind of money, I suggest you buy the Nikon, or wait for the next generation Olympus DSLR but then still read the reviews to make sure they got it right.", "Date": "December 29, 2005"}, {"Title": "Better than expected", "Author": "Eduardo Torre", "ReviewID": "R2BCUSXKA7ZPBA", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "Originally I have my doubts about this camera so I started to look for reviews and compare it with others.

The shipping and the associated wait? That is another story! I chose free shipping (kick, kick!) and thought the the product would reach me in 5 to 9 days. No - it would \"SHIP\" in 5 to 9 days from wherever it is. So, for the next 9 BUSINESS DAYS, I watched my order - the product sat in a warehouse. I was tempted to cancel and get it via overnight shipping a couple times - or try the Prime Shipping as a one-off thing - but that would not be fair, right? Painstakingly, the product moved and came tantalizingly close - about 15 miles from where I live - and sat in a UPS warehouse for 2 more days. The last time UPS was supposed to deliver, it had just noted \"Premises closed\" - when I was at home waiting for the package all through the 8 hour window - and at around 2 PM the day of the delivery, I started getting the feeling that UPS would find a lock dangling at my place. Ultimately, it did not turn out to be the case. Overall, it took more than 12 days to travel 100 miles or so.To rub it in, the battery took HOURS and HOURS to charge - it takes from 8 to 10 hours to charge fully. So, if you are in a hurry, do not order free shipping and add 10 hours to the UPS window to estimate the time you would first use the camera.Results of the camera - excellent. I prefer to use the xD card in order to avoid the bulk and number of pins (that can go out of alignment - see another post in this trail) of a CF card.
